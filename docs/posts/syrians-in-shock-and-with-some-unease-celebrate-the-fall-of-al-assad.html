    <h1>Syrians, in Shock and With Some Unease, Celebrate the Fall of al-Assad</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Syrian security checkpoints sat empty on Monday across Damascus. Abandoned tanks were scattered across the roads, along with stray pieces of military uniforms stripped off by soldiers when opposition forces stormed into the city a day earlier.</p><p>Rebels with rifles slung over their shoulders drove around, many seemingly shocked at just how quickly they had ousted<span>  </span>Syria’s long-entrenched president, Bashar al-Assad. Damascus residents, too, were walking around the city’s streets in a state of disbelief.</p><p>Some rushed to a notorious prison on the outskirts of Damascus, the capital, desperate to find loved ones who had disappeared under Mr. al-Assad’s brutal reign. Others clambered on top of cars and screamed curses at the Assad family, words that days ago could have meant a death sentence.</p><p>By day’s end, with Mr. al-Assad and his family having fled on a plane to his ally Russia, thousands of Syrians had converged at Umayyad Square in the city center to revel in the fall of the regime and their newfound, if uncertain, sense of freedom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We’re shocked; all of us are just shocked,” one woman, Shahnaz Sezad, 50, said. “It’s as if we’re all coming back to life after a nightmare.”</p><p>She watched, tears welling up, as a scene unimaginable just days ago played out in front of her. One rebel shouted into a microphone: “The Syrian people want to execute Bashar! The Syrian people want to execute Bashar!” A deafening “paw-paw-paw” of gunfire sounded as others shot into the air.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/multimedia/09syria-ledeall-02-tvmq/09syria-ledeall-02-tvmq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/multimedia/09syria-ledeall-02-tvmq/09syria-ledeall-02-tvmq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/multimedia/09syria-ledeall-02-tvmq/09syria-ledeall-02-tvmq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man with a bike walks past a portrait of Hafez al-Assad overhead on a street littered with debris.

The only certainty seemed to be that the city was free from the brutal reign of the Assad family, which ruled the country with an iron fist for more than 60 years. Remnants of Mr. al-Assad’s regime were scattered across the city; the posters with his face, once ubiquitous, were torn off walls and ripped to shreds.</p><p>As the rebel coalition that swept into Damascus suddenly found itself in charge of the Syrian capital, a sense of unease mingled with the disbelief. The precariousness of their newly won freedom was not lost on them. No one — not residents, not rebels — seemed certain of what might come next, beyond the daunting task of reconciling the deep ethnic, sectarian and religious divisions that racked the country under Mr. al-Assad’s rule.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The rebel leadership announced in a statement on<span>  </span>Monday that its forces were “about to finish controlling the capital and preserving public property.” The rebels said they were forming a transitional government, and called on public sector employees to return to work.</p><p>The statement did not name the leader of the transitional government, but local news reports said it would be Mohammed al-Bashir, who was previously the head of a rebel-run administration in northwestern Syria.</p><p>The rebels’ leader, Ahmed al-Shara, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani (he has shed the nom de guerre he had used throughout Syria’s long civil war), also made a conciliatory gesture toward Syria’s government institutions and their staffs on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thousands of Syrians went to Sednaya prison on Monday in search of missing relatives.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“We can’t dispense with the previous state,” Mr. al-Shara told Mr. al-Assad’s prime minister,<span>  </span>who stayed behind when the president fled, according to a video clip of the meeting posted by the rebel leaders. The rebels’ experience governing has been limited to the patch of territory they held before toppling the government.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In a video of him speaking at the ancient Umayyad mosque in Damascus, Mr. al-Shara can be heard lauding the rebels’ surprisingly rapid victory. “By God’s grace,” he says, “this land of Syria was liberated within 11 days from its north to its south, from its east to its west.”</p><p>Late Monday morning, Victor Dawli, 59, stood in his apartment’s entryway in Old Damascus, the centuries-old city center of winding, narrow alleys. As a truck carrying rebels passed, Mr. Dawli waved, a cigarette in hand. One fighter, clutching his rifle and hunched over in the bed of the truck, nodded.</p><p>Mr. Dawli’s neighborhood, Babsharqi, is home mostly to Christians, many of whom had supported the Assad government and now fear that they could face retribution. Since Mr. al-Assad’s flight abroad on Sunday as rebels seized the capital, many people in the neighborhood have been walking a tightrope. Some have kept their heads down and stayed inside their homes. Others, like Mr. Dawli, say they secretly supported the rebels from the start.</p><p>When one neighbor passed by, Mr. Dawli shouted to him, “Good morning, congratulations!” The man gave him a blank stare and then hurried down a nearby alleyway. “There are people who are scared,” Mr. Dawli said. “You tell them congratulations, and they feel uneasy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Praying in Umayyad Square on Monday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Across the capital, opposition forces appeared to be trying to restore a sense of order to the city. Small groups of rebels in mismatched camouflage stood outside government buildings and banks blocking people from entering and ransacking them as many had done a day earlier. Other rebels wearing plain clothing and carrying rifles directed traffic at major intersections.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Still others drove through the streets to marvel at the capital, or to track down relatives they had not seen in over a decade.</p><p>One rebel, Mohammad Bakir, 41, sat in the back of a car, his rifle tucked between his knees. He had been stuck for about an hour in traffic, one of thousands of people trying to get to Sednaya, the prison on the outskirts of Damascus that had come to symbolize terror and death under the Assads’ regime.</p><p>Mr. Bakir said that his mother, brother and cousin had all disappeared in 2012 in Idlib Province after taking to the streets to protest the government. He had not heard any news about them in the 12 years since.</p><p>“Seizing the city is a joy — we are joyous,” Mr. Bakir said, shouting over the din of car horns. “But the real victory will be when I find my family.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thousands of people celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s long and brutal reign in Syria.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>By the time he arrived at the prison, thousands of families had converged upon it, touring its now-empty cells and desperately asking rebels for news of the prisoners released on Sunday, and whether any others remained. Some men with pickaxes tore into the cement floor, hoping to find the secret prison cells they were convinced were hidden underground and still holding prisoners.</p><p>A few miles from the border, the body of a man in military uniform lay sprawled on the ground next to an abandoned pickup. Down the road from one Syrian military base, a convoy of 10 rebel vehicles sped down the highway. They drove four-wheel-drive vehicles — their doors and windows caked in mud as camouflage — and Syrian military vehicles armed with rockets that once belonged to the Assad government.</p><p>There were signs of the lawlessness that many fear might seize the country in the coming days or weeks if the rebel coalition was unable to maintain order.</p><p>The storefront windows of a duty-free shop just across the border from Lebanon were smashed, while bottles, chocolates and bags of snacks were strewed across the floor. Windshields and windows of dozens of abandoned cars along the roads were broken, their doors flung open.</p><p>Two young men fiddled with the wires beneath one abandoned truck, an apparent attempt to jump-start the vehicle. Nearby, one young man stood in front of an abandoned tank taking a selfie. He picked up his toddler and placed him on top of the tank for a photo. Then he told him to hold his fingers up in a V — the sign for victory.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christina Goldbaum is the Afghanistan and Pakistan bureau chief for The Times, leading the coverage of the region.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Shock, Glee and Unease as Syrians Wonder What’s Next<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
