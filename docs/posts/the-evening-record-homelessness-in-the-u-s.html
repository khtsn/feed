The report listed the national housing crisis and the end of pandemic-era supports as reasons, but federal officials told reporters that asylum-seeking migrants had overwhelmed the shelter systems and made for much of the increase. </p><p>Veterans were the lone group among whom homelessness declined last year, and the number of homeless veterans is down more than half since 2009. That trend has been driven by bipartisan support for services and housing that is at odds with the rancor of the broader homelessness debate.</p><p>The new numbers may widen that partisan divide. Democrats often blame soaring housing costs, flagging government rental subsidies and extremes in economic inequality, and tend to support an expanded safety net.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many Republicans blame liberal permissiveness and want to require unhoused people to seek aid for mental illness or substance abuse as a condition of receiving aid. President-elect Donald Trump has called for clearing cities of encampments and placing unhoused people into camps.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Separating sludge from wastewater at a facility in Fort Worth.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-73eab5c3">The E.P.A. promotes fertilizer it was warned was toxic<span>  </span></h2><p>The Environmental Protection Agency has continued to encourage the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, even though it was told that it contained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/climate/epa-pfas-fertilizer-3m-forever-chemicals.html" title="">high levels of toxic “forever chemicals,”</a> a Times investigation found. </p><p>In 2000, scientists at the chemicals giant 3M discovered high levels of PFAS — the virtually indestructible chemicals used in nonstick pans, stain-resistant carpets and many other products — in the nation’s sewage. 3M never published its research, but shared its findings with the E.P.A. in 2003, according to documents reviewed by The Times. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Today, the E.P.A. still promotes the use of sludge as fertilizer.
