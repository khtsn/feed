The colorful online role-playing game where the likes of orcs, blood elves, night elves and dwarves band together to complete quests and vanquish villains transcended the realm of video games to become a pop culture phenomenon.</p><p>After World of Warcraft was released by Blizzard Entertainment in November 2004, millions of people paid monthly subscriptions to join guilds with their real-life friends or in hopes of making new ones. Soon it was being featured on “South Park” and in political campaigns. Then came the requisite Hollywood adaptation. The game has also spilled into unexpected spaces like cryptocurrency and epidemiology.</p><p>Although no longer at the height of its influence, World of Warcraft — known by its fans as WoW — it is still going strong: Its latest expansion, The War Within, was released in August. In honor of World of Warcraft’s 20th anniversary this month, here are 20 ways that it shook things up.</p><h2 id="link-53c2abc9">WoW was a social network before social media.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/arts/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/arts/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/arts/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A large convention center with dramatic lighting, filled by rows of computers on which people are gaming." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/arts/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/arts/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/arts/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/arts/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw/17warcraft-anniversary-hcjw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/dba4af3e-9739-5f79-8eb7-b8be42ace6aa" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The newest World of Warcraft expansion was a popular stop at Blizzard Entertainment’s annual convention in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Scarnici/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Because World of Warcraft’s popularity eclipsed its genre predecessors, it was where many people got a taste of the future of online social networks.

But entering the bustling capitals of World of Warcraft, where hundreds of players would congregate, was another experience altogether.</p><p>Before he joined Blizzard in 2008, Ion Hazzikostas was a guild leader who spent long nights playing the game while he worked as a lawyer in Washington.</p><p>“Often we would just log in and use it as the coolest chat room in the world,” said Hazzikostas, who is now a senior game director for World of Warcraft. “It was literally: Who’s on right now? And let’s just hang out.”</p><p>He added, “The guild that I played with 20 years ago is still going strong.” <em>— A.B.</em></p><hr/><h2 id="link-3eeb0ffc">Politicians have used WoW as a campaign tool.</h2><p>As part of the Democratic Party’s attempt to reach young voters online this year, Vice President Kamala Harris’s Twitch account hosted a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/tim-walz-twitch-stream.html" title="">livestream of World of Warcraft</a> beside a Tim Walz rally.</p><p>The crowd that gathered was small, at about 5,000 people. But it was a more positive view of World of Warcraft than Maine’s Republican Party took in 2012, when <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/10/candidate-slammed-for-world-of-warcraft-fandom-082043" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it attacked a State Senate candidate</a> who had said online that her orc assassination rogue liked to “stab things.” (She won with <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colleen_Lachowicz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 53 percent of the vote</a> and served one term.) <em>— J.B.</em></p><hr/><h2 id="link-58b2edff">A ‘South Park’ episode about WoW won an Emmy.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The “South Park” episode “Make Love, Not Warcraft” explored the addictive quality of the game.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Comedy Central</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The irreverent animated comedy took on World of Warcraft in the 2006 episode “Make Love, Not Warcraft,” where Cartman and company aim to take down a vindictive and highly ranked player. The episode, which won an Emmy, explored the addictive quality of the game and was a meditation on media fixation before the distractions of smartphones and social media.

The Peter Jackson movies in the 2000s reinforced that terrifying depiction.</p><p>But World of Warcraft rehabilitated the orc’s public image. Suddenly, these creatures were capable of heroism. Orcs banded together with other monstrous races, fighting for the right to exist in a world that feared them. <em>— Z.S.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-56208c88">A meeeeeeeeme is booooooooorn.</h2><p>While his party calculated how to execute a dungeon run in 2005, a player named Leeroy Jenkins doomed everyone by shouting his name and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4&amp;t=1s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">barging into a room that spawns dragons</a>.

In theory, players should have died before carrying the infection too widely. But it went far beyond those borders when they used portals to travel to other regions, and was further amplified by pets and nonplayer characters.</p><p>In a preview of the real-world <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/world-of-warcraft-coronavirus-corrupted-blood/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/09/world-warcraft-experienced-pandemic-2005-that-experience-may-help-coronavirus-researchers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pandemic</a> in 2020, the World of Warcraft community attempted self-isolation and quarantines.

Trump — joined a company that outsourced endless hours of gold farming to underpaid Chinese workers. He secured $60 million in funding from Goldman Sachs and other investors, according to the reporter Joshua Green’s 2017 book, “Devil’s Bargain.”</p><p>Blizzard attempted to ban players who traded virtual gold for real gold, and Bannon’s company, Internet Gaming Entertainment, was eventually hit with a lawsuit, restructured and sold.</p><p>Green said the experience had a lasting effect on Bannon.
