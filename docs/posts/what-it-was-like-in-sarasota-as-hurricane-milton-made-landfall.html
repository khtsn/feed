    <h1>What It Was Like in Sarasota as Hurricane Milton Made Landfall</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I grew up in New England and have covered blizzards and nor’easters for decades, as well as the recent epic flooding in Vermont. But I had never experienced a hurricane in Florida.</p><p>One thing was the same: the persistent uncertainty, down to the last hours, about how bad it would be and where the worst impact would be felt. Nothing had prepared me, though, for the raw intensity of the experience — the long, anxious hours of listening in the dark to a raging wall of weather.</p><p>The minutes I spent outside as the hurricane’s massive eye passed over were as unforgettable as the total eclipse I witnessed in northern Maine in April — an interval of sheer wonder at the mystery and power of the natural world, in which everything else, fear included, briefly falls away.</p><p>By daybreak on Thursday, the howling winds had subsided, and people began to venture outside to see what the storm had left behind. The wind uprooted trees, stripped sections of metal-sided buildings, and tossed yachts onto the edge of Bayfront Drive along the waterfront.</p><p>By 8 a.m., residents were emerging to breezy conditions and clearing skies to walk dogs and begin clearing limbs and branches.</p></div></div>
