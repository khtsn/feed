    <h1>Israel Says It Will Keep Troops ‘Temporarily’ in 5 Points in Lebanon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“We will leave small amounts of troops deployed temporarily in five strategic points along the border in Lebanon so we can continue to defend our residents and to make sure there’s no immediate threat,” said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesman, in a briefing for reporters on Monday afternoon.</p><p>Colonel Shoshani named several locations spread along most of the length of the 75-mile border, including places across the border from Israeli villages that were badly damaged by Hezbollah rocket fire during the war. He said that Hezbollah had not lived up to its own side of the November agreement and still posed a threat to Israeli residents in those areas. He declined to say how long the occupation would last. It is unclear to what extent Hezbollah has a presence in those areas.</p><p>Hezbollah’s leader, Naim Qassem, vehemently opposed the idea of Israel keeping troops inside Lebanon during a speech on Sunday. But he stopped short of pledging to resume attacks against Israel.</p><p>“Israel must withdraw completely on Feb. 18,” Mr. Qassem said. “This is the agreement.” </p><p>“Everyone knows how an occupation is dealt with,” he warned, without giving further details.</p><p>The war between Hezbollah and Israel broke out after the Lebanese militia started firing on Israeli military positions in solidarity with its ally Hamas, shortly after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. </p></div></div>
