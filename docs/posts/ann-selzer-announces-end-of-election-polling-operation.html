    <h1>Ann Selzer Announces End of Election Polling Operation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Would I have liked to make this announcement after a final poll aligned with Election Day results?” Ms. Selzer wrote. “Of course. It’s ironic that it’s just the opposite.”</p><p>“Polling is a science of estimation, and science has a way of periodically humbling the scientist,” she added. “So I’m humbled yet always willing to learn from unexpected findings.”</p><p>Ms. Selzer’s announcement caps a polling career spanning more than three decades, one in which, she said, she was no stranger to being “the outlier queen.” Her previous notable polls include one showing Senator Barack Obama of Illinois winning the Iowa Democratic caucuses in 2008 and another predicting Mr. Trump easily beating Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020 in Iowa, an outcome few others foresaw.</p><p>This year’s poll was indeed an outlier. On Election Day, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Mr. Trump’s running mate, emerged from a polling booth in Cincinnati and dismissed Ms. Selzer’s poll and its finding that women were breaking for Ms. Harris — a result that many thought could have implications across swing states.</p><p>The Register, which oversees the Iowa Poll run by Ms. Selzer, said on Sunday there was “no likely single culprit” for the discrepancy between the poll and the final tally.</p></div></div>
