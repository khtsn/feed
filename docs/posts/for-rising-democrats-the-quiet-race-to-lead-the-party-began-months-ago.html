Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania spoke at a storied Atlanta church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/raphael-warnock-ebenezer-baptist-georgia-senate.html" title="">once preached</a>, introducing himself as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/us/politics/mastriano-shapiro-antisemitism.html" title="">fellow person of faith</a>.</p><p>And as early voting began in Nevada, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois was in the state, rallying with union members and attending a block party in support of abortion rights.</p><p>Democrats didn’t have a competitive presidential primary race this year, the kind of contest that could have propelled state leaders to national stardom and forced a robust discussion about the direction of the party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But as up-and-coming Democrats blanketed the country — campaigning for the presidential ticket, promoting down-ballot candidates, working the national fund-raising and cable news circuits — many of them also managed to quietly develop bigger platforms, broader networks and a batch of new admirers across some of the country’s most politically important states.</p><p>Such advantages will help determine who has outsize influence in the debate over the beleaguered party’s future — and who generates the most buzz in the earliest stages of the next presidential race.</p><p>“Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, so many candidates had been coming into New Hampshire for years before they actually ran,” said Raymond Buckley, the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, whose state hosted many ambitious Democratic surrogates this cycle. “It gives them an opportunity to size us up, and we get to size them up.”</p><p>The 2028 presidential election is many political lifetimes away, and it is impossible to predict how a second Trump term will shape it or what the Democratic field will look like. Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota have not said what they will do next, and many of this year’s other in-demand Democrats insist that, for now, they are focused on governing.</p><p>But Donna Brazile, a former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, said she expected that a “new generation” would “try to wrestle control of this party and its future.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Here’s a snapshot of the notable places that rising Democrats visited this year, the relationships they forged and the impressions they made.</p><h2 id="link-7875803e">Making nice in New Hampshire and North Carolina</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of Ms. Harris during a campaign rally in October in Greenville, N.C.

Several Democrats who ran for president in 2020 also have networks there, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Buckley noted.</p><p>The Democratic candidate for governor in New Hampshire <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/new-hampshire-governor-ayotte-craig.html" title="">lost</a>.
