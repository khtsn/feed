With less filling than other Korean-style dumplings, they fry up flat and eat more like jeon, the pan-fried fritters or pancakes and stars of Korean party food, especially during holidays like Seollal, the Korean New Year. A finish of gochugaru, sea salt and scallions reflects how these are typically served on the streets of Daegu, a southeastern South Korean city. Though traditionally shaped like half moons, Eric Kim uses square wonton wrappers folded into triangles for more surface area and, in turn, more crunch.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>7:41</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Kimchi Napjak Mandu (Flat Dumplings)</h2></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Hi. I’m Eric Kim.” “I’m a cooking columnist for ‘The New York Times.’” [MUSIC PLAYING] “Hey. It’s Eric Kim. I’m a cooking columnist for ‘The New York Times.’ And it’s dumpling week. I wanted to share a very specific type called napjak mandu. And that means flat dumplings. They have less filling than a regular dumpling because the point of these is the crispy wrapper. It’s a classic of the city, Daegu in South Korea. In my family, my mom’s the main cook. She is the one who makes the filling and makes the stock. And then she calls my brother, my dad, and me down. And we help her fold the dumplings. It’s not really a thing that you want to do by yourself, folding all those dumplings. It’s a fun way for all of us to be involved. But also, we grew up understanding the value of that dumpling. There’s something about the makeup of my mom’s history and my dad’s history that resulted in kimchi mandu. It’s always been our family’s favorite. The irony of dumplings is that it might take a couple of hours to fold 50 or 60 dumplings, but you can eat them in 30 seconds. I like this sauce because it’s just such a simple iteration of that familiar dipping sauce. That ratio of salt, sweet, sharp, it really is up to you. And sometimes we would even build the sauce in our own little dishes at the table. So the mandu part of this recipe starts with boiling dangmyeon. Dangmyeon are those really lovely sweet potato noodles that you would find in dishes like japchae. It’s also a classic filler of any Korean mandu. You’ll notice that they’re pretty sticky, which is good. You want that. You don’t want to undercook these because it’s their fluffiness, their softness that really soaks up so many of those seasonings. Chop them up as finely as you can. The kimchi is the main flavoring here, so you do want to try to find or use a really nicely ripened kimchi because so much natural flavor comes from that fermented cabbage product. You want to drain your kimchi before you finely chop that as well and add it. I decided on really bulking up on the scallions. I think classically, you would use garlic chives. But I think scallions give you that soft sweetness. I think that’s really lovely with the noodles. You want to fortify the flavors that are already there without adding too much water. And the way to do that is by adding gochugaru, which is a Korean red pepper powder. A little soy sauce is going to bring out those savory notes even more. But a little salt and sugar just really amps up those flavors. So you really season to taste. Take a bite of that filling before you fill all your dumpling wrappers. You want to make sure it’s pretty assertively seasoned. And the last note is toasted sesame oil. A little bit of it finished the filling. It glossed it up a teeny bit. It adds a little fat. It also rounds out the flavors and makes them feel so full. There’s no wrong way to do this, but I have a certain process that works for me personally in my brain. I take one wonton skin. I put it in front of me. I have a 2 teaspoon ice cream scoop at home that I like to use. You can scoop that very sticky filling and just plop it into the center of that wrapper. I take my five little fingers, and I dunk the tips into a small bowl of water. One finger at a time, I gently glide along each edge while switching fingers. One finger dip gets you about one edge. And then your finger will be dry after that. After I wet each edge, I take one corner of the wrapper. And I fold it over the filling to create a triangle. It’s an isosceles triangle, I think, because this is longer. It’s a squared plus b squared equals c squared. So that’s what you’re making. Anyway —” “After you do that, I take two fingers, and I really press around the filling over the skin to squeeze air from the inside out while sealing the edges because the one thing that you really don’t want to happen when you boil these is you don’t want the filling to puncture out. At this stage, you can freeze the dumplings. And you can have dumplings whenever you want. You could stop after the boiling step and just enjoy them as boiled dumplings. That’s really delicious as well. You have a lot of options. You can give up at any step, and you’ll have something really delicious. That’s my point. So the next step, I like to use that same water that you use to boil the dangmyeon. And then one thing that I think is really helpful is you create a whirlpool. Just swirl your spoon or spatula in that pot so that it creates some motion. And that’s when I add about five to six, seven dumplings because if you were to just plop them in, they can stick to the bottom. And that’s really not great. So you just boil the dumplings for about two minutes. They don’t take long. The matte dumpling wrapper becomes a little glossier. And that bright red kimchi noodle filling will show through that translucent wrapper a little more. And so the dumplings will literally become more red. There’s a trick that I do to really get that moisture off of them before we fry them. This is a trick I got from my Aunt Georgia, actually. The microwave, it finishes steaming them. And it pushes any excess water or air out of the filling. If you don’t have a microwave, you can actually just drain them on a paper towel. It’s not a big deal. After that, all you do is you fry them. I like to take a nonstick skillet, put it over medium heat, add a little bit of oil. You actually don’t even need that much oil for this. You’re just crisping them up in the pan. You get a nice light golden color. It’s a really thin, shattering kind of crisp. You want your teeth to sink into that plush noodle and the lovely kimchi. And it’s a really lovely textural experience. You have all the textures. You get a sprinkling of gochugaru and sometimes scallion. And then the sauce that we made in the beginning, that will usually be poured over it, actually. I like to use it as a dipping sauce because if you are making this for a party, those crispy triangles are really great to pass around. There’s so much flavor here for so few ingredients. It’s about the sum of everything like the scallion on top, the gochugaru. It’s so special and interesting and fun to eat. I think with this recipe, it felt really good to lean into what my family does and what my mother did for us growing up, and the flavors that really mean Seollal and Lunar New Year to me. And that final bite with the crisp and the yielding to the softness, that is the flavor of Korean cooking. And I’m crying because I don’t know why. But I love — I think whenever I develop a Korean recipe, there’s just so much pressure to get it right. And I think after four years at this job, I just want to show people that you don’t need much to have a really joyful dish, a celebratory dish that sometimes can’t really be finished without the help of your family. This week, you’ll have five dumplings to choose from. I hope you’ll make all five. This is mine, my kimchi napjak mandu. It’s heaven on a plate, I think. And I hope you love it. You can find this recipe and many more at nytcooking.com. I like yours. Those are cool. Those look — sorry. Yours look great too.” [MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/multimedia/27Dumplingweek-Kimchi-napjak-wbcf/27Dumplingweek-Kimchi-napjak-wbcf-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Linda Xiao for The New York Times.

And then we just like sprinkle on top, because it could be optional. It’s not really optional. Everyone should do it, actually. Nothing is optional.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “Hi, I’m Sue Li. I am a food stylist, as well as a ‘New York Times’ contributor. And today we are going to make wontons for Dumpling Week. I love this version of a chili oil wonton. It’s a flavor that I tasted when I was a line cook in New York City. We would have late night takeout meals sometimes, and it was just a very familiar flavor. It was a pork and shrimp wonton with a chili oil sauce. It was like slightly sweet, and salty, and had peanuts on it. Here, I’ve tried to recreate it for you. So this wonton is actually a very classic wonton recipe. Let’s make the filling. I’m going to chop some shrimp. You don’t need to chop it super finely. I’m going to combine ground pork, chopped up shrimp, white pepper, salt, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, and soy sauce. You don’t really have to be afraid of overmixing. I’m going to combine all of these ingredients together until the flavors are evenly distributed.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “Now let’s head into wrapping our wontons. Set yourself up with a sheet tray, or any tray. Get a small bowl of water so that you can seal them properly. Dust it thoroughly with cornstarch. This is a wonton wrapper that you can pretty much buy in any grocery store. I hold it up in my hand like this, so that the two points are here and here. Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center. Dab my finger in a little bit of water. Wet the top edges of the wrapper, then seal it in half into a triangle. Make a divot in the center where the filling is. Shape it so that it looks like a fortune cookie, and then join showing the two edges together, like so. Now this is a shape that resembles a gold ingot. It’s a very lucky symbol that resembles wealth and fortune, and just good vibes to come.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “I think making dumplings is very meditative. I do go into a trance when I make it. I listen to a podcast or I work in silence.” Solo? “Solo. I don’t — I don’t really like it when you come into the kitchen when I’m cooking, because people are messy, and I’m very controlling. This is my personality. And you can come and eat, and also do not help clean up.” “I’m blushing because I’m embarrassed. It’s true, though.” “You want to make some with me? Remember how I was like, ‘don’t come in my kitchen?’ That’s O.K. I’m just joking. I want you to stand right here. I’m going to tell you exactly what to do. We’ll do it together one time, and then there’s a test. Wrapper, just put the whole spoon in your wrapper. Water. And dab in the other.” “One strip, one strip that way.” “Pick the side up. Fold it in half into a triangle. Pinch, pinch, pinch to make a tight seal. Divot with your finger. And then what I would like you to do, you see this.” “Oh, it’s a very demure lady.” “It is a very — I do think these are very demure.” “Oh, I did it.” “Yeah. Oh my God, it’s beautiful. Do this. Look at this perfect thing you made.” - [LAUGHS]: “Who’s holding it?” “Do it again. So here we have a tray of the wontons already assembled, cover it with plastic wrap, and set it in the refrigerator while we prepare the chili oil sauce. The sauce is so delicious. I made a recipe where you have to make a little extra. And that’s because you can add as much of the sauce as you want onto your wontons, or you can save it for another meal. I would like you to put in a heatproof bowl, preferably stainless, your scallions, garlic, pepper flakes, sesame seeds, Bay leaf, star anise. And then we’re going to heat up some vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it’s almost at a smoking point. The surface of the oil will first start to look like it’s shimmering, and it’s a little wavy, but all of a sudden, it’ll stop doing the shimmer. And that is about when you want to take it off and pour it over your seasoning.” [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHS] “So the dark soy sauce and the sweet soy sauce are essential. I almost want to say that they’re my cheats. You kind of can’t substitute that with sugar and soy sauce. You need to have these two ingredients to really add to the deep savoriness of this recipe. Let’s make some wontons. Let’s bring a pot of water to a boil. I’m going to do it in two batches. What I normally would like to do is swirl the water before I add the wontons. Think of it as your poultry and egg. You want to swirl your water so it doesn’t stick to the bottom. In about five to seven minutes, depending on how fast your pot comes back up to a boil, the wontons are now ready.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “And then you just do a nice drizzle. When I say a drizzle, I mean, flood it with a lot of sauce. And it can be finished here. You can serve it right away, but it’s also a very traditional thing to add the ground peanuts on top. And the extra bonus is the Sichuan peppercorns, which has that slight numbing flavor that people crave when they’re eating a dish like this. You want another bit of this bright, thinly sliced scallions on top. My mouth is watering. Let’s break for lunch.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “What I like to do is I like to toss them in the sauce a little while they’re in my bowl. They’re so good. I’m so proud of this recipe. You can taste the shrimp and the pork, and then the sauce on top. There’s a bit of a sweetness and the tanginess. Some crunch from the peanuts and the garlic that was in the sauce that has now crisped up. So these are the chili oil wontons. They’re so beautiful, actually. Look at that. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Very good fortune to you. Very good fortune to you. And if you want to find this recipe and the other dumpling recipes, please go to New York Times’ Cooking. I did it. Let’s eat. Are we done? O.K., great. Milton, I’m sorry you had to hear me chew.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/multimedia/29DUMPLINGWEEKrex5-wontons-wcjh/24DUMPLINGWEEKrex5-wontons-wcjh-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Linda Xiao for The New York Times.

Yes, it’s a tattoo from a photo of my mom’s hands making gok jai dumplings. I actually haven’t shown my mom this. So I’m probably going to get in trouble.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “Hi, I’m Hetty Lui McKinnon. And I’m a cookbook author and food writer. And welcome to Dumpling Week. I chose gok jai dumplings, one of the most treasured recipes in my family. These particular gok jai dumplings are from Zhongshan, which is where both my parents are from. I grew up in Australia, as you can probably tell. It’s the first recipe my mom ever wrote down for me. Some people might know gok jai as a very different dumpling. In Zhongshan, it’s a savory dumpling in a translucent skin that’s steamed. It can feel a little bit intimidating to do. But the more you make them, the better you’ll get. Even if they’re not the prettiest, they’ll still taste good. You’re not losing if you make a dumpling, ever. So for the filling, we’ve got some celery, got some carrots. We’re going to put our rehydrated, drained, and squeezed out mushrooms and wood ear fungus in there. Water chestnuts, some zha cai, which is pickled mustard stems. And that’s going to add some nice saltiness. Some extra firm tofu. So we’re going to put that in, and we’re just going to pulse. Do not purée. You can actually chop by hand, if you want. But the food processor just makes it so much faster. We want nicely chopped pieces, but not pulverized or puréed.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “So we’re going to heat up a large skillet or fry pan, add a little bit of oil, and then throw all of your filling in. Add some sugar. This is a little trick from my mom. The sugar stops the mushrooms and the wood ear fungus from just absorbing all the saltiness of the soy sauce, which is going to be added in later. So we’re going to cook that for three to five minutes, just until the vegetables soften and the mushrooms are cooked. Once the soy sauce is in, we’re going to turn off the heat. And we season with salt and white pepper. And we want this mixture to be quite flavorsome because the wrapper is actually completely neutral in flavor. So we want to season appropriately. So I recommend tasting and adding more if you feel like it. Now, what the corn starch does is it just absorbs any excess moisture because we don’t want the filling to be saucy. We want it to be quite dry.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “The next thing we’re going to do is make the dough. In a big pot, you’re going to add your wheat starch, your tapioca starch, and your potato starch. Get your boiling water, and you’re going to pour that in right on top of the starch because we need the heat to cook the starch. I love to use chopsticks because it gives you maximum maneuverability. You’re just going to stir the boiling water into the starches. You don’t have to get it completely mixed in. You’re still going to see some dry bits. And then you’re going to put the lid on, and we let the starches steam for 10 minutes. And the steam time is really important. That boiling water is going to cook the starches and make it easy to roll later on. The dough is still very hot. So if you want, you can wear some gloves. I usually don’t because I’ve got asbestos hands, and I’m used to high heat. But we’re going to bring the dough together in the pot with your hands until there’s no more dry bits. Then we’re going to put a little bit of oil on your countertop. And then you’re going to knead that dough for 10 minutes. The kneading is really important because it means that when you steam the dough, it’s not going to crack. You need to get that elasticity in. And you’ll understand it once you eat them because these dumplings are really bouncy. It’s a beautiful, rich white dough. It’s almost like snow. So for the dough, you’re going to divide that into six equal pieces, if you can. And you can use scales to weigh them, if you like. I usually just eyeball it. Place them on a sheet pan or a plate, and then cover them in a wet cloth. So we’re going to work with one piece of dough at a time. We’re going to roll that into a log that’s about 1 and 1/2 inches in thickness. And then we’re going to cut that into 1-inch pieces. So you should be able to get between seven, eight, or nine pieces out of each log. Working with these 1-inch pieces, we’re going to roll them into a ball. And then we’re going to roll them out into a wrapper that is about 3 and 1/2 inches in diameter. We can either roll them by hand by just pressing them out. I like to use a tortilla press, which is how my mom makes these. That’s what she uses in her house. A tortilla press makes really quick work of the task of rolling. So then we’re going to add our filling. I like to use about 2 teaspoons. You can use more or less. If you’re new to dumpling making, I always say use less filling. And as you get more confident rolling, add more. Fold the dumpling over, and then we’re going to seal the edge. Now, this dumpling is quite a tacky dough. So you don’t need any water. We’re just going to press them together all the way around. So you almost create a border for yourself. Then we’re going to crimp them. You basically use your thumb and your index finger. They’re doing your hard work. And you’re going to press down with your thumb to create a little bit of a pleat. And then we’re going to keep working all the way around. It’s quite hard to explain, but lucky you have this video.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “Then once you’re done, we move on to steaming. I use bamboo steamers. You can really steam them in many layers. Line the steamers with either parchment paper or some silicone liners. You can also use Napa cabbage or something like that. Put the dumplings on the top, not touching if you can. A wok is great because the large size bamboo steamer kind of fits perfectly in there. The water actually steams off really fast. So every few minutes, I would be adding more water to the wok. Before they’re ready, they’re going to be very still quite white. But once they’re ready, you’re going to start seeing a little bit of translucency. As they sit and cool, they’re going to become much more translucent. And you’re going to see the filling through the wrapper. So they’re very, very beautiful.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “These are my family’s gok jai dumplings. I don’t eat these with any sauce. But if you wanted a sauce, you could go chili crisp or something. All right. The big tasting. The dough is so bouncy. It’s so chewy. It’s the most satisfying dumpling. I feel like when you’re making a recipe that belongs to your family, it doesn’t belong to me. It belongs to my ancestors. And so I want to make it as true to the way they would have made it as I can. From my family to yours, I hope you really enjoy making these. I hope you try them. I hope you love them. And I hope you love sharing them with your friends. And Happy Lunar New Year. If you’re looking for this recipe or any of the dumpling recipes, you can get it over at ‘NYT Cooking.’ I could eat all of these in about five seconds. That’s why you need to make 48 of them.” [GIGGLES] [MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/multimedia/27Dumpling-Week-Gok-Jai-hqkj/27Dumpling-Week-Gok-Jai-hqkj-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-4c481aed">Beef Dumplings</h2><h3 id="link-2b341c29"><span><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026446-beef-dumplings-with-zucchini-tofu-and-chives" title="">View Recipe</a></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>These beef dumplings from Kay Chun are packed with zucchini and tofu, which keep the filling tender and juicy.

I’m a cook and a recipe developer for ‘NYT Cooking.’ Welcome to Dumpling Week. Today, I’ll be making my grandmother’s amazing beef dumplings. So the dumplings are really juicy and tender. The ground beef gets mixed with a seasoning that’s typical for a lot of Korean barbecue meats. The Korean chives give it a really great, lovely onion, garlic flavor. I remember making these dumplings all the time growing up. We would sit around this huge bowl of filling and wrap hundreds and hundreds of dumplings. And it’s probably the first recipe that I remember ever making and learning. So it’s really special to me. First, we’ve got the zucchini. I’m going to toss it in salt. What the salt does is it seasons the zucchini, and then also helps draw out some of the excess water. Leave it for about 15 minutes. So in the meantime, get the beef marinating. Probably the most important part about making dumplings is having a really well-seasoned filling. We’re going to marinate it in some soy sauce, vinegar for a little brightness, and then all your usual aromatics. Got the garlic and ginger, with some salt and pepper, of course, toasted sesame oil that gives it a nice richness, scallions. And that all gets mixed together. Use your fingertips to get everything well-incorporated. Kind of like a meatball mixture. You don’t want to overwork it too much. Just want to make sure it’s well-blended. The tofu, we are just going to gently press between paper towels to damp out the excess water, and then just crumble it over the beef. Nothing too complicated. It doesn’t matter if the sizes are different. Mix it all together with all the remaining filling ingredients. It’ll all get incorporated into the beef eventually. Now we’ll drain the zucchini. Give it a gentle squeeze to remove any excess water. So we can go ahead and add that to the dumpling mix. Mix it all together until it’s well-incorporated. So now we’re ready to wrap our dumplings. First, you’ll want to lightly dust a baking sheet with cornstarch. And this is to prevent any sticking. Keep your dumpling wrappers covered with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from getting dry. To actually wrap the dumpling, place about a tablespoon of filling in the center of the wrapper. And then my favorite part, you’re going to want to tuck in a few pine nuts. My grandmother used to do this to give you a nice surprise when you bit into the dumpling. And then you can use your fingertip to moisten half of the dumpling wrapper on the edge. Bring the two sides together and press tightly so that the wrapper sticks to itself. What’s helpful is if you pinch it in the center and seal down one side first and then the other, it helps you work out the air bubbles. You could actually just cook them like this. But if you have a little extra time, use your fingertips to pinch along the edge and use your other hand to help create the crimp, kind of like when you’re making pie dough.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “You going?” “All right.” “Come on.” [LAUGHS] “Maybe poke the pine nuts in so you don’t rip —” “Oh, O.K.” “Oh, my god!” “Yeah!” [MUSIC PLAYING] “Now it’s like home, where you have everyone in the family wrapping together. Once you’ve filled all your dumplings, we can go ahead and make this really easy dipping sauce. Two parts soy sauce to one part vinegar, and just a touch of sugar to balance the vinegar. The special part about this dipping sauce is that my grandmother would mince up some pine nuts and put them on top. Adds nice texture to the sauce. And it mimics the flavor of the pine nuts in the dumpling. How I love to make these dumplings is to pan fry them. But it’s a mix between frying and steaming. Heat up some oil in a nonstick skillet. Arrange your dumplings pleat side up so they’re sitting flat in the pan. Don’t crowd the skillet too much. I’m putting 12 dumplings in the skillet to give them enough room to crisp up nicely. And you want to just let them cook over medium low until they’re lightly golden on the bottom. Then you’re going to add some water. You don’t need much. Just add 2 tablespoons, and that’s enough to create the steam without making the dumplings soggy. You’ll get crispy little bits on the bottom. And then you’ll also get the soft, tender bits of the wrapper as it steams.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “So these are my family’s beef dumplings. There we go. It’s going to be messy. It’s so fragrant from the chives. And it’s super tender from the zucchini and tofu. I hope you make them and enjoy them. Happy Lunar New Year. And Happy Dumping Week.

So even if chocolate is not a traditional auspicious food, can we just say it is? Can we just say that these dumplings represent prosperity, and family unity, and all the goodness that is chocolate? All right, culture police, come at me! [LAUGHS]:” [UPBEAT MUSIC] “I’m Genevieve Ko, senior editor and columnist at ‘NYT Cooking.’ Welcome to Dumpling Week. It’s our first ever Dumpling Week. To celebrate the Lunar New Year with dumplings, I’m making chocolate sesame dumplings. And these have a sweet mochi wrapper encasing a molten chocolate filling. It’s almost like a truffle. These dumplings were actually inspired by dumplings that my kids loved when they were little. And so this is a grown-up version for them now that they’re a bit older. Thinking about the memories from Lunar New year, not just from my childhood, but from my kids’ childhood — childhoods? For my kids’ childhoods, I thought a lot about and I worried a lot about how far they would go from their culture. And at a certain point, I just realized that actually, the way that they celebrate Lunar New Year and understand it is, of course, going to change, and that one of those ways is, of course, through food. This mixing of cultures is really a part of this celebration. It’s part of the way that we celebrate Lunar New Year now.” [LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC] “The first thing I’m going to do is make the chocolate filling. These are basically really easy chocolate truffles. So you can see here, I’m just going to break up this chocolate bar into pieces. I don’t even bother with chopping. Or you can use chocolate chips, or you can do a mix. Put the chocolate in this metal bowl. Set it over simmering water. And when about 2/3 of the chocolate is melted, then you can take that off the heat. And then stir gently until the rest of the chocolate is melted. And then you’re going to add sweetened condensed milk, toasted sesame oil, and a pinch of sea salt. That’s going to give it a really great sweet, salty balance. And you’re going to stir really gently until it’s smooth again. You don’t want to stir too vigorously because that’s going to cause the chocolate to break. You just want to stir it really gently. And the sweetened condensed milk here gives the chocolate a really lovely creaminess and flavor, but it also helps it stay really stable. So you don’t even have to chill it at this point. All you have to do is scoop it into little balls. They don’t have to be perfect balls, but you do want them to be about the same size. So you want 16 balls of chocolate. I find a melon baller is really great for this. Or you can just pinch off pieces with your hands and roll them into balls. If your kitchen is cold enough, you can just leave it all at room temperature. Otherwise, pop them in the fridge so that they stay stiff. Once that chocolate filling is done, we can go ahead and make the dough. If you have a scale, you definitely want to use that scale to measure flour here, because glutinous rice flour is really fine and very light. I’m going to bring 1/2 a cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan, and as soon as it comes to a boil, I’m turning off the heat and I’m stirring in more toasted sesame oil. This is going to both flavor the dough and actually keep it really tender. Start stirring this just-boiled water right into the flour. Keep stirring, and stirring, and stirring until this mixture forms these little bits that look like a mixture of pebbles, and gravel, and sand. Chopsticks really work best for this, but you can also use a fork. Once I’m at this point, I’m going to see if it’s cool enough now for me to handle. And it is. It’s nice and warm. If anything, oh my God, it feels really nice. It’s almost like a bath. [LAUGHS] Gather this dough, all these pebbles, and just squeeze them together, and form it into a ball. I’m going to let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes, just so that it can come to room temperature. And also, this is going to give the dough a chance to absorb the water that was added. And this water, because it was almost boiling, it actually precooked the flour a bit, which is exactly what we want. It’s been about seven minutes. And I can feel that the dough has had a chance to rest. It’s relaxed a bit. But I can also feel that it’s sticking. It’s sticking to my fingers. So I’m going to knead this dough on a floured surface until it doesn’t stick to my fingers anymore. I sometimes find that I don’t have to add any extra flour — that at this point, the dough is totally perfect. It really just depends on how dry my kitchen is or what the humidity is like in the air. It is pouring rain today, so it’s pretty humid. So I’m just going to knead flour into this dough. So it should almost feel a little sticky, but not actually stick to my fingers. I don’t actually want any flour to be sitting on the surface. So as long as it keeps getting absorbed into the dough, I’m just going to keep adding more. And the dough is now so smooth, and it really feels like playdough. It’s so soft, it’s so tacky, it’s ready to go. And I’m going to roll it into this log and cut it into 16 even pieces by cutting it in half first, cutting these halves in half until I get to 16 equal pieces. So these little dough balls, I definitely want to keep them covered with the same damp towel that I was using earlier for the dough, because if this dough dries out on the outside, it actually develops these weird cracks and dry bits. One of the important things with dumplings is that you always want to pinch out your dough so that the edges are way thinner than the center. You almost have a little, like, fat belly of dough in the middle. And then, as you move out towards the edge, it should get thinner, and thinner, and thinner because you’re pleating all those edges together. By doing it this way, you’re going to end up with an even layer of dough all around. So now that the dough is about a three-inch round, put one of these chocolate balls in the middle and start pleating it. While holding it up, I’m going to just start pleating it on one side and keep going around in a circle, all the way around until I get to the other end. And it’s O.K. that the top is open, because now I’m just going to gather all that pleated dough and pinch it shut. Gather it pretty gently, because this dough is so soft and malleable that if I pinch it really hard, it’s going to get rid of those beautiful pleats. And if I have a little extra dough, I’m going to pull it off. But sometimes it depends on the size of your dough and balls. Sometimes when I don’t feel like going through all the pleating and I just want to get these done really quickly, or if I’m doing it with my kids and they don’t feel like pleating, I just bring the dough up around that chocolate filling. And you get all these natural pleats anyway. I’m just going to do that with all of my dough balls and all of my chocolate balls.” [UPBEAT MUSIC] “I’m setting up with a wok and with bamboo steamers, but you can actually use any steamer you have if you just have an insert, as long as you have a flat bottom that you can line with either parchment paper or a silicone mat like this one that’s perforated. Putting eight on each level, because right is a really lucky, auspicious number for the Lunar New year, or all the time. I don’t actually want the water boiling super hard. I don’t want these to cook too quickly. This dough is quite delicate. And I also don’t want the chocolate to break. And I’m just going to keep checking these dumplings as they steam. And what I’m looking for is for the dough to become translucent. The dough actually is taking on this — it’s almost like a pearlescent quality. I don’t want them to go too long because then they’ll become totally translucent and collapse. These are ready. And while they are still warm and sticky, sprinkle the tops with black and white sesame seeds. I just love the nuttiness of both of them. So these are my chocolate sesame dessert dumplings. All right, so let’s see how our dumpling is. [GIGGLES]: So good and so sticky. Making homemade dumpling wrappers might feel like a project, and it is. But using glutinous rice flour, like, having this be the entry point is so great because it’s so forgiving. It’s wonderful. It’s malleable. Once you get past that sticky stage, it feels like a hug. Like, if dough can feel like a hug, it 100 percent does because it’s so soft, where it’s like sinking into a couch. All right. Thanks so much for joining me for making chocolate sesame dumplings. We are going to have this recipe in all of our Dumpling Week recipes on nytcooking.com.” Happy Lunar New Year! “Yay! They work.” “They do.” “Woo-hoo. Steamers are great. If you don’t have a bamboo steamer, you should get a bamboo steamer.” [LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC]</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/multimedia/27Dumpling-week-chocolate-cwvl/27Dumpling-week-chocolate-cwvl-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p><h2 id="link-555691c6">How to Host a Dumpling Party</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Preparing the dumplings together, in an assembly line, can be a celebration in and of itself.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-4b9f0bf6">1. Prep your guests and space.</h2><p>Dumpling parties are family gatherings where everyone helps out and lingers. If those you’re having over aren’t related to you (and even if they are), they should know that they’ll be getting their hands dirty, and that the dumplings will be ready whenever they’re done helping you make them. Clear counter or table space for everyone to cook together, and be sure to get enough ingredients for each person to eat at least a dozen dumplings.</p><h2 id="link-678b0c08">2. Set up three cooking stations.</h2><p>First, prepare an assembly line, but make it a circle: Place a bowl of filling in the middle of every three to five cooks, along with wrappers and a floured sheet tray or plate. (Cooks can chat more easily if they face one another when wrapping dumplings.) Together, they’ll line up their sealed parcels like soldiers on the tray.</p><p>Next, have steamers or a pot of boiling water or nonstick skillets ready for cooking the dumplings. Cooks should have serving platters next to the stove to fill with the hot morsels.</p><p>Finally, set up a sauce bar with condiments that pair well with the dumplings, such as soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and chile crisp. That way, each person can create a blend to taste. (If a recipe calls for a specific sauce, task someone with prepping it or do it before guests arrive.)</p><p>Guests can spend time at each of the stations or stay put at one. (Some saints will hopefully volunteer to create a dishwashing station.)</p><h2 id="link-154b13e">3. Serve them hot.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Keeping steamers at the ready to cook the dumplings can make prep all the more streamlined.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>For nonstop nibbling, have people rotate among the stations to assemble, cook and eat as batches are ready. For a sit-down feast, everyone can help assemble the dumplings at the same time. Once the last one is pinched shut, the dumplings can be cooked all at once in a big pot of boiling water, a stack of bamboo steamers or multiple big skillets. (Assembled more dumplings than you can eat? Freeze uncooked ones spaced apart on a tray until rock hard, then transfer them to resealable containers or freezer bags. Cook them directly from their frozen state for up to three months.)</p><p>Whatever you do, always remember that there’s a rhythm to making dumplings: a fill, fold, pleat and pinch that quiets the soul when practiced alone — and swells it with chatter and laughter when done together.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Genevieve Ko is a deputy editor and columnist for the Food section and NYT Cooking, for which she also develops recipes.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/2025/01/27/dining/dumpling-recipe.html">65</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>How will we eat in 2025? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/dining/food-eating-predictions-2025.html">Food forecasters see a year of offbeat choices</a>, including savory coffees, great convenience-store cuisine and sauces on everything.</p></li><li><p>The U.S. surgeon general’s warning about the link between drinking and cancer comes at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/dining/drinks/restaurants-alcohol-surgeon-general-warning.html">precarious time for restaurant owners</a> trying to pencil out a profit that hinges on alcohol sales.</p></li><li><p>Slices of New York-style pizza, once confined to the city’s five boroughs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/dining/new-york-pizza-slice.html">have now gone fully nationwide</a>.</p></li><li><p>In this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/dining/american-bakeries-golden-age.html">golden age of American bakeries</a>, virtuosic pastries and delightful breads are close at hand, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-bakeries-america.html">from coastal Maine to downtown Los Angeles</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Eating in New York City</strong></p><ul><li><p>From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-nyc-pizza-pizzeria.html">pizza</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-bagels-nyc.html">bagels</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-nyc-sandwiches.html">sandwiches</a>, we’re searching all five boroughs for the food that defines New York City.</p></li><li><p>New York may be losing its identity as the city that doesn’t sleep, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/dining/24-hour-diner.html">motley guests at one 24-hour diner in Brooklyn</a> show the spirit is still wide awake.</p></li><li><p>Need a cure for the winter blues? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/dining/restaurant-review-cafe-kestrel-cocina-consuelo-nyc.html">Cafe Kestrel in Brooklyn and Cocina Consuelo in Harlem</a> can restore the spirit with warm service, cheery surroundings and deeply satisfying food.</p></li><li><p>To little fanfare, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/dining/sushi-sho-nyc.html">one of Japan’s great sushi masters</a> is sweating the details of the exacting Edomae tradition at Sushi Sho in Midtown.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
