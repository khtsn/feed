		Malaspina</span> and <span data-ref-id="1">Dylan		&#34;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/16003/runi">runi</a>&#34;
		Cade</span>, two players who were both in their second stint with the American organization.</p>

<p>runi, who played a part of the team&#39;s in-game leader duties, announced his retirement from professional Valorant shortly after the announcement was made by his former. </p>

<p>&#34;It just feels like time to move on from playing, unfortunately didn&#39;t get where I wanted to but still happy to have experienced something once in a lifetime,&#34; runi <a href="https://x.com/runiVL/status/1843365937589714950" target="_blank">said</a>. &#34;Not sure what&#39;s next but for now it&#39;s time to just enjoy time with friends and family.&#34;</p>

<p>runi was a part of the Cloud9 team in 2023, joining after spending time with Challengers sides <span data-ref-id="2">

</span>. He departed Cloud9 in the offseason following 2023, but rejoined the squad following their elimination from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1923/champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff/group-stage" target="_blank">Americas Kickoff</a> and before the start of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2004/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-1/regular-season" target="_blank">Americas Stage 1</a>.</p>

<p>A month after the conclusion of their 2024 season, Cloud9 announced that Vanity had been benched and allowed to explore options with a new team as a restricted free agent. With the newest announcement, he is now an unattached free agent. </p>

<p>Like runi, vanity was also in his second go-around with Cloud9. He also assumed the team&#39;s IGL duties throughout the course of his C9 career. He played for them from 2021 to 2023, with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo/bracket-stage" target="_blank">LOCK IN//SÃ£o Paulo</a> marking the end of his time. He rejoined ahead of the 2024 season.</p>

<p>In 2024, Cloud9 fell short of the heights that they&#39;d hoped for. They failed to qualify for any international events, being eliminated in the group stages of Kickoff and bowing out early in the knockout rounds of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 playoffs.</p>
