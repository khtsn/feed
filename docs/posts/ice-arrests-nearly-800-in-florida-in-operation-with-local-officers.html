The officers picked up more than 275 migrants with final removal orders, the data showed.</p><p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ice-florida-officials-arrest-750-4-day-operation/story?id=121161606" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ABC News</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nearly-800-illegal-aliens-arrested-massive-florida-ice-operation-tidal-wave" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a> earlier reported news of the arrests, which took place over four days.</p><p>It was the latest move by the Trump administration to seek to accelerate deportations of undocumented immigrants, which have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/22/us/trump-deportation-flights-maps.html" title="">so far</a> been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-admin-pushing-immigrants-self-deport-deportation-numbers-lag-rcna201099" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well below the administration’s goals</a>.</p><p>Since President Trump took office, ICE officials have worked with various federal agencies to conduct raids across the United States. The effort this week in Florida was the first to be conducted as part of a formal arrangement with state law enforcement known as a 287(g) agreement, according to the official.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Trump administration has sought to recruit local authorities to help in immigration operations in an effort to speed deportations. The administration has resumed collateral arrests during such operations, which allows officers to pick up migrants who were not initially targeted but were around an individual who was sought by ICE.</p><p>Generally, people must have received an order of removal from an immigration judge before they are deported, a process that can take weeks or stretch into years. But since the start of 2024, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/09/us/immigrant-rights-deportation.html" title="">70 percent of these removal orders</a> were issued to someone who did not attend their hearing before a judge, according to a Times analysis of court records.</p><p>“It’s going to break up families,” said Tessa Petit, the executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said of the arrests this week. “And that is not the welcoming state that Florida has been for immigrants for decades.”</p><p>Given the scale of the operation, Ms. Petit said, there is a chance that many of those arrested were in the country on some sort of legal status and did not possess criminal records.</p><p>The raids represented the biggest escalation of immigration enforcement in Florida since Mr. Trump took office, Ms. Petit said, adding that they were much more reflective of the president’s mass deportation promises.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>ICE operations in communities take an extensive amount of research and surveillance. They also require many officers, which is why the Trump administration has pulled in several other law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Trump administration officials have increasingly turned to warning undocumented immigrants to leave the country.</p><p>“President Trump and I have a clear message to those in our country illegally: LEAVE NOW,” said Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, in a statement on Monday. “If you do not self-deport, we will hunt you down, arrest you and deport you.”</p><p>Orlando Mayorquín<!-- -->, <!-- -->Albert Sun<!-- --> and <!-- -->Miriam Jordan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>2-Year-Old U.S. Citizen Deported:</strong> A federal judge in Louisiana said the deportation of the child to Honduras with her mother, even though her father had filed an emergency petition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/us-citizen-deported.html">appeared to be “illegal and unconstitutional</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Deported to a ‘Home’ He Barely Knew: </strong>Two decades had passed since Nascimento Blair was last in Jamaica, his homeland. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/nyregion/deportation-trump-jamaica.html">Much had changed, including Blair himself</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Challenging Due Process Rights:</strong> White House officials are eschewing normal legal processes as they rush to ramp up deportations, saying there is no time to afford unauthorized immigrants any rights — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-immigrants-trials-deportation.html">and that they don’t deserve them anyway</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A ‘Shattered’ Life: </strong>An Indonesian man with a student visa and an American wife thought he would soon get a green card. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/minnesota-student-aditya-harsono-visa.html">Now, he could get deported over a 2022 arrest</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia</strong><strong>:</strong> Four House Democrats traveled to El Salvador to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/abrego-garcia-el-salvador-democrats.html">press for the release of a Maryland resident</a> who was mistakenly deported there.
