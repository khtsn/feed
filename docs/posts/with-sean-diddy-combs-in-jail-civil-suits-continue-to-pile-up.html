His lawyers have adamantly denied the charges, accusing prosecutors of manipulating sexual encounters between consenting adults into a sex trafficking case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As he awaits trial, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-bail-appeal.html" title="">detained in a Brooklyn jail</a>, the civil suits against Mr. Combs have continued to grow. The lawsuit is the eighth filed over the past year by a woman accusing him of sexual assault; three other lawsuits have made allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr. Combs’s lawyers have been seeking dismissals of the other suits in court and have described them as false claims cobbled together to try to secure a financial settlement from Mr. Combs.</p><p>The newest lawsuit said the plaintiff, who lives in Florida, met Mr. Combs overseas in 2020 and began seeing him regularly in 2021. Drivers would pick her up, the suit says, and she would be taken to his homes in Los Angeles, New York and Florida.</p><p>The suit highlighted an instance in April 2022 when the plaintiff alleged that Mr. Combs sexually assaulted her at his home in Los Angeles. That same spring, the court filing says, she woke up with bruised feet and a bite mark on her heel but did not know how she had been injured.</p><p>And in a separate instance later that year, the court filing says, she was “compelled to ingest an unknown substance” and lost consciousness throughout the night; she later discovered she was pregnant but had a miscarriage.</p><p>The plaintiff says in the suit that she felt compelled to continue visiting Mr. Combs because of repeated calls and texts from him and third parties that continued until she complied. She says in the suit that Mr. Combs would pay her an allowance “to control her,” record sexual encounters without her permission and pressure her to involve others in their sexual encounters despite her objections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The legal claims at the center of the suit include sexual assault and violation of New York City’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/arts/ny-sexual-misconduct-sean-comb-lawsuits.html" title="">Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law</a>.</p><p>The allegations align with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html" title="">some of those made by federal prosecutors</a>, whose case revolves around allegations that Mr. Combs coerced women into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html" title="">elaborate sexual encounters with male prostitutes called “freak offs,”</a> which they said Mr. Combs often recorded. Prosecutors accused him of drugging women to comply with these encounters and using financial coercion to keep them in line.</p><p>The indictment refers to one specific alleged victim — described in court papers as “Victim 1” — whose allegations closely align with those of Cassie, the singer and former girlfriend of Mr. Combs who filed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/music/cassie-diddy-sean-combs-settlement.html" title="">and quickly settled</a>, a lawsuit last year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">accusing him of years of sexual and physical abuse</a>.</p><p>In a court hearing, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, Marc Agnifilo, said the government’s case was based on the allegations of that one accuser, whose decade-long relationship with his client was troubled but whose sexual encounters were consensual. “That is how these two adults chose to be intimate,” he said.</p><p>The government has alleged, however, that “multiple victims have been abused in freak offs.”</p><p>A lawyer for the anonymous plaintiff in Friday’s lawsuit, Joseph L. Ciaccio, declined to comment on whether his client was involved in the federal investigation.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
