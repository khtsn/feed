Cmdr. Conrad Shinn, a Navy pilot who became the first person to land a plane at the South Pole, on Oct. 31, 1956, helping to open the frigid expanse of Antarctica to scientific research and bolster American strategic interests during the Cold War, died on May 15 in Charlotte, N.C. He was 102.</p><p>His daughter Connie Shinn said he died at a care facility. Until February, he had lived in Pensacola, Fla., since retiring in 1963.</p><p>During World War II, Commander Shinn, who was known as Gus, airlifted combat casualties in the Pacific. He was then assigned to a naval air station in Washington, D.C., but ferrying admirals and friends of President Harry S. Truman did not satisfy his craving for adventure.</p><p>When an executive officer asked whether he wanted to go to Antarctica, Commander Shinn said sure, knowing almost nothing about the bottom of the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It was just a place to go,” he told the historian <a href="https://upcolorado.com/university-press-of-colorado/item/1916-deep-freeze" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dian Olson Belanger</a> for an <a href="https://user-web.icecube.wisc.edu/~mnewcomb/antarctic_history/Shinn_Transcript.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oral history project in 1999</a>.</p><p>In 1946 and 1947, Commander Shinn flew photographic mapping missions over Antarctica on an expedition called <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/operation-highjump-18223476/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Operation Highjump</a>. He returned between 1955 and 1958 for a series of expeditions called Operation Deep Freeze.</p><p>This time, he and six other Navy men aboard his plane became the first people to set foot at the South Pole in four-plus decades and the first ever by air.</p><p><a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/race-to-the-end-of-the-earth/amundsen/timeline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roald Amundsen</a>, the Norwegian explorer, arrived by dog sled on Dec. 14, 1911, and his ill-fated British rival, <a href="https://nzaht.org/conserve/explorer-bases/scotts-hut-cape-evans/history-of-scotts-expedition/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert Falcon Scott</a>, arrived a month later on Jan. 17, 1912, having traveled via motorized sledges, dog- and horse-drawn transport,<span>  </span>and on foot. (Mr. Scott and four other members of his party died in forbidding conditions on their return trip.)</p><p>Commander Shinn described a good pilot as one who was confident but knew his limitations. Safety for him was a primary concern, his family said, sometimes to the extreme.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His daughter Diane Shinn said that he made her wear a motorcycle helmet in the car as he drove her from college in Greensboro, N.C., to his home in Pensacola in 1973, particularly concerned about stretches of two-lane highways. He wore one, too.</p><p>“It looked like we were in a cockpit,” Ms. Shinn said with a laugh in an interview last week.</p><p>Operation Deep Freeze was a collaborative effort among 40 nations to conduct scientific studies stretching from the North Pole to the South Pole and the land masses, oceans and atmosphere in between. In Antarctica, the mission was to study the weather, solar activity, mineral abundance, the earth’s magnetic field, glaciers and oceans. </p><p>There were military anxieties, too, in those early years of the nuclear age. Amid concerns of a possible attack on the United States by the Soviet Union via one of the poles, the American military could not “afford to miss an opportunity to evaluate the Antarctic continent as a strategic outpost in time of war,” <a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1956/march/operation-deepfreeze-fits-out" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rear Adm. George J. Dufek wrote</a> seven months before joining Commander Shinn as commanding officer on the landing at the South Pole.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Commander Shinn, third from left, with the crew and passengers who were on the first flight to land at the South Pole.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. Navy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On Oct. 31, 1956, Commander Shinn, Admiral Dufek and five other Navy men made the seven-hour flight from McMurdo Station on Antarctica to the pole aboard an <a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/nnam/explore/collections/aircraft/r/r4d-5l-skytrain--que-sera-sera-.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">R4D-5L Skytrain</a>, a twin-engine military version of the commercial DC-3. Internal politics affected the assigned duties for the extraordinary mission.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A captain onboard, Douglas Cordiner, was so upset at not being named the co-pilot that he later stood on the deck of a ship in New Zealand and “threw his library of Antarctica into the water,” Commander Shinn said in his oral history interview.</p><p>The R4D, nicknamed Que Sera Sera — Whatever Will Be Will Be — after a popular song, had its landing gear outfitted with skis and was accompanied by a circling Air Force C-124 Globemaster cargo aircraft. Maurice Cutler, then an 18-year-old United Press correspondent from Australia who joined other reporters on the cargo plane, which had wheels but no skis, said in an interview that pallets of survival gear were to be airdropped if Commander Shinn’s plane could not lift off from the pole.</p><p>The landing, photographed from above by Mr. Cutler, was not exceptionally rough. Commander Shinn set his plane down at 8:34 p.m. during continuous sunlight across windblown ridges on a desolate ice sheet nearly 10,000 feet above sea level. The temperature was minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo of Commander Shinn’s plane landing at the South Pole.

By then, the skis had become stuck to the ice.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In the thin air on the ice cap, the propeller-driven plane, weighing 28,000 pounds, did not budge with its engines at full power. “We just sat on the ice like an old mud hen,” Commander Shinn told the <a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/nnam/explore/collections/aircraft/r/r4d-5l-skytrain--que-sera-sera-.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Naval Aviation Museum</a>.</p><p>To gain thrust, Commander Shinn made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnUsAJyPuyg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jet-assisted takeoff</a>, firing a series of small rockets housed in canisters attached to the fuselage. After all 15 rockets had been fired, the plane lifted off. “Barely,” he said in a radio interview a day or so after the flight.</p><p>Tom Henderson, who directed the 2019 documentary <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13248406/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Ice Eagles,”</a> about aviation in Antarctica, said in a recent interview that Commander Shinn had told him he had lifted off at 58 miles an hour, two below the plane’s minimum designated takeoff speed.</p><p>Later, an engine oil pressure light came on, Mr. Henderson said, and Commander Shinn promptly unscrewed the bulb, telling his co-pilot that he’d rather not have Admiral Dufek “see that and get excited.”</p><p>Late in Commander Shinn’s life, his daughters said, when asked about being the first pilot to land a plane at the South Pole, he began replying, “And the first to take off.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Conrad Selwyn Shinn was born on Sept. 12, 1922, in Leaksville, N.C., a small mill town since consolidated with two others.</p><p>His father, Thomas Pinkney Shinn, was a secretary at a local Y.M.C.A. His mother, Mattie Jane (Krimminger) Shinn, ran the household. Conrad was drawn to flying by the trailblazing exploits of aviators like Charles Lindbergh, who made the first solo, nonstop flight across the Atlantic in 1927, and Wiley Post, who flew the first solo flight around the world in 1933.</p><p>Commander Shinn studied aeronautical engineering at North Carolina State College (now a university), joined the Navy in 1942, and then graduated from aviation school and received his commission in 1943. After the war, he married Gloria Roberson Carter, a legal secretary. She died in 2004.</p><p>Along with his two daughters, Commander Shinn is survived by a son, David; a sister, Jean Shinn Hart, who is 90; and a grandson.</p><p>Commander Shinn’s pioneering flight showed that remote research stations could be supported by air. Today, planes land routinely at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. In his oral history interview, he said he had probably landed six miles from the actual pole. Mr. Cutler’s initial United Press dispatch said four miles.</p><p>Given the circumstances of the time, Commander Shinn said, “it was the best we could do.”</p><p>“Close enough,” Ms. Belanger, his interviewer, replied.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeré Longman is a Times reporter on the Obituaries desk who writes the occasional sports-related story.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
