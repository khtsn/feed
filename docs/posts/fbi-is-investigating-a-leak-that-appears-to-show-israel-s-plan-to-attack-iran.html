Hezbollah said it had targeted the Glilot base in the suburbs of Tel Aviv, which houses the headquarters of Unit 8200, a signals intelligence branch of the Israeli military. The militant group said it had also targeted a naval base outside the port city of Haifa. There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.</p><div><p>Mr. Blinken met on Tuesday afternoon with Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the death toll in an overnight Israeli strike near Lebanon’s largest public hospital rose to 18 people, Lebanon’s health ministry said, along with 60 injured.

Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday for meetings with senior Israeli officials, as the Biden administration hopes to leverage Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week to revive the push for a cease-fire in Gaza.</p><p>Mr. Blinken met on Tuesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Later, he was expected to meet with Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, and President Isaac Herzog, among others.</p><div><p>Mr. Sinwar, the leader of Hamas and an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, surprise assault on Israel, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/18/world/israel-hamas-yahya-sinwar-news" title="">killed last week</a> by Israeli forces during a chance encounter in Rafah. He had been Israel’s No. 1 target after plotting the attack last year that killed up to 1,200 people, captured some 250 hostages and ignited the war in Gaza, and he had long steered Hamas’s hard-line stance in truce talks.</p><p>Since Mr. Sinwar’s killing, Israeli officials and mediators have been tossing around new ideas for a proposal that would pause fighting with Hamas, free at least some of the dozens of hostages remaining in Gaza and bring home the captives who are presumed dead by the Israeli authorities.</p><p>The war has defied a yearlong diplomatic effort by the Biden administration — including numerous trips to the region by senior officials including Mr. Blinken — to clinch a deal to end it. Instead the violence has widened, escalating into a full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and direct strikes by Iran against Israeli territory.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has vowed that the war in Gaza will not end until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas has vowed to continue fighting unless Israel agrees to a permanent cease-fire and the complete withdrawal of its forces from Gaza.</p><p>One possibility discussed by Israel’s security cabinet in recent days is a much briefer truce of roughly a week and a half, similar to the weeklong truce between Israel and Hamas last November that saw more than 100 hostages and 240 Palestinian prisoners freed, according two Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.</p><p>But it is far from clear such a pause would be acceptable to Hamas, which has vowed to hold onto the remaining hostages until Israel ends its devastating offensive in Gaza. The group has also yet to announce a new leader to replace Mr. Sinwar, who dominated its decision-making.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWMzYzlkNmEtZDMzZC01NWVmLTkyMmQtNjdiN2JjMzI4OWRi"><div id="ac3c9d6a-d33d-55ef-922d-67b7bc3289db" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah#ac3c9d6a-d33d-55ef-922d-67b7bc3289db"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman"><img alt="Aaron Boxerman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-22T12:49:44.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 22, 2024, 8:49 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman" itemprop="name">Aaron Boxerman</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Jerusalem</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>The Hezbollah comments appeared to be an effort to create distance between Iran, its main backer, and the drone attack.

But on Monday, authorities made a rare exception for an event promoting settlement construction in the Gaza Strip, led by 10 members of the government and senior ministers, half from Prime Minister Netanyahu’s Likud party, and including the far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.</p><p>Though only a few hundred, mostly religious, attendees gathered in the remote desert makeshift compound of wooden huts with white sheets as walls — built to reflect the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which commemorates the Israelites’ journey through the desert by spending time in temporary shelters — the event highlighted the influence of settler activists within the Israeli government and Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party.</p><div><p>In January, Mr. Netanyahu said that his government did not support plans to build settlements on the ruins of Gaza. His opposition likely stems from concerns that re-establishing settlements could complicate Israel’s security situation and damage its standing abroad, as settlements are considered illegal under international law. Israel also faces frequent criticism for the hardships Palestinians endure under Israeli military rule and the presence of settlers in the West Bank.</p><p>But as the war against Hamas continues with no end in sight, and amid uncertainty about Israel’s postwar plan, some in the Israeli leader’s coalition want to put pressure on him to reverse, or at least soften, his position on reviving Jewish settlements in Gaza.</p><p>“Everyone in Likud supports this as an idea,” said Avihai Boaron, a member of the Knesset from the Likud party who attended the event. “Our job now is to legitimize this as a plan.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli settler activists setting up Sukkahs, temporary huts for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tsafrir Abayov/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>For much of the world, the settlements, which were dismantled in Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, were viewed as a barrier to resolving the conflict — a stance that continues to apply to those in the West Bank.</p><p>But for settler activists who believe the Gaza Strip is part of a biblical land promised to the Jewish people, leaving it in 2005 wasn’t just a mistake: it was a sin.

But the military “later concluded that the truck was owned by the Lebanese Army, and that three operatives were killed.”</p><div><p>The deaths of the Lebanese soldiers highlighted the complicated dynamic that Lebanon’s army is navigating as Israel invades its territory to fight Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant and political group with significant influence in the country.</p><p>The Lebanese Army is not a party to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Still, Lebanon’s military does not support Israel’s invasion of its country, and referred to Israel as the “enemy” in statements on Sunday and Monday about the soldiers’ deaths, saying they were targeted when they were driving in an army vehicle in southern Lebanon.</p><p>By contrast, the Israeli military said in a statement that it is “not operating against the Lebanese Army and apologizes for these unwanted circumstances.”</p><p>It was the third time this month that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/nx-s1-5150126/israel-lebanon-strikes-un-peacekeepers-lebanese-soldiers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Israeli troops have killed Lebanese soldiers</a> amid Israel’s war with Hezbollah.

The army has long maintained a position of neutrality that has given it legitimacy with international players like the United States, which it would quickly lose if it joined the fight, she said.</p><p>“It would be difficult for the U.S. to fund the Lebanese Armed Forces if they fight Israel,” she said.</p><p>And Lebanon’s army adopted its neutral position in part because it is “extremely weak” economically and otherwise, Ms. Kavanagh said. Lebanon has been in a severe economic crisis since 2019, leaving the army scrambling to recruit, pay salaries, train and get equipment, and it is no match for either Israel or Hezbollah, she said.</p><p>But she said the view that Israel’s war against Hezbollah could prove advantageous for Lebanon in the long term is held mostly by those outside the country. The Lebanese army does want to be stronger, she said, but Israel “just taking out Hezbollah positions isn’t going to get it there.”</p><p>The Lebanese army was supposed to work with United Nations peacekeepers to ensure that Hezbollah militants could not operate in southern Lebanon, according to a 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution, known as 1701, that ended the last war between Israel and Hezbollah. The army has been criticized for failing to enforce the terms of that resolution, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/us-diplomacy-israel-lebanon.html" title="">which international diplomats are now seeking to revive</a>.</p><p>In his visit to Lebanon on Monday, Mr. Hochstein, the American envoy, pledged to support Lebanon’s reconstruction if the U.N. resolution is enforced, seeming to suggest that the United States wants the Lebanese government to push for Hezbollah’s disarmament in southern Lebanon, and to deploy more Lebanese troops in its place.</p><p>But the army still plays <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/10/17/lebanons-army-is-less-useless-than-its-reputation-suggests" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an important role</a> in Lebanon even if it is not undertaking the traditional job of a military to maintain its country’s territorial integrity. As long as Israel maintains its position that it is not at war with Lebanon or its people and is targeting only Hezbollah — and if Lebanon argues that it doesn’t have effective control over Hezbollah, from a legal perspective — the two states are not in an armed conflict and the army’s primary role is focused inward, experts say.</p><p>“Its role is to protect the state and its people, to protect Lebanese civilians,” said <a href="https://www.qatar.georgetown.edu/faculty/noha-aboueldahab/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Noha Aboueldahab</a>, an assistant professor of international law at Georgetown University in Qatar. “They need to play a humanitarian role for civilians.”</p><p>Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhhMTljMzhlLTE3M2ItNTk0NS04MDRmLWVjMjY1MzI1YzAwZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah#israel-lebanon-hezbollah-bank" data-source-id="100000009772789"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aryn-baker"><img alt="Aryn Baker" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-21T20:31:41.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 21, 2024, 4:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aryn-baker" itemprop="name">Aryn Baker</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhhMTljMzhlLTE3M2ItNTk0NS04MDRmLWVjMjY1MzI1YzAwZA=="><a href="#israel-lebanon-hezbollah-bank">What is Al-Qard al-Hasan, the Hezbollah-linked finance group targeted by Israel?</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Al-Qard al-Hassan documents scattered at the southern outskirts of Beirut on Monday after Israeli airstrikes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hassan Ammar/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Israeli military conducted a wave of airstrikes across Lebanon on Sunday, targeting multiple branches of Al-Qard al-Hasan, a financial organization that functions as a bank and is associated with the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah.</p><p>Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military’s spokesman, said in a news briefing on Monday that one of the targets that was hit was a vault used by Al-Qard al-Hasan that was underneath a residential building in Beirut, the Lebanese capital. The vault, he said, contained “tens of millions of dollars.”</p><div><p>Israel’s minister of defense, Yoav Gallant, signed an order on Monday adding Al-Qard al-Hassan to a list of groups designated by Israel as terrorist organizations. The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations.</p><h2 id="link-3e95d68a">What is Al-Qard al-Hasan?</h2><p>In addition to its military wing, Hezbollah also functions as a political organization and provides a range of social services inside Lebanon. Al-Qard al-Hasan is registered as a charity in Lebanon.</p><p>The organization’s name translates as “benevolent loan,” lending money based on the principles of Islamic finance, which prohibits interest. The loans, usually no more than $5,000, are backed by deposits of gold, jewelry or other valuable goods. It also offers savings accounts and financial transfers, and processes payments.</p><p>The de facto bank, which has around 30 branches, is the largest microcredit organization in a country where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/world/middleeast/lebanon-banks-economic-crisis.html" title="">the traditional banking sector is in shambles</a>. It is not regulated by the central bank and is not part of the international banking system.</p><h2 id="link-2541418f">Who uses the organization?</h2><p>Since its founding in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/world/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-explained.html" title="">a significant force in Lebanon</a>, wielding political power and military strength, as well as providing social support, particularly to the country’s large Shiite population. The bank was set up in 1983 to serve the Shiite community, but it gained more clients in 2019 when the banking system all but collapsed.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0170" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claims</a> that the bank has been used by Hezbollah as “a cover to manage the terrorist group’s financial activities and gain access to the international financial system.”</p><p>The department placed Al-Qard al-Hasan under sanctions in 2007 for operating as Hezbollah’s de facto banking arm. In 2021, in the wake of the Lebanese financial crisis, the sanctions were strengthened, with the department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0170" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accusing</a> the association of “hoarding hard currency that is desperately needed by the Lebanese economy” and compromising the stability of the Lebanese state.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A branch of Al-Qard al-Hassan in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Zayyat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-3a628919">Why is Israel targeting Al-Qard al-Hasan?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/business/dealbook/is-crypto-financing-terrorism.html" title="">Shlomit Wagman</a>, the former chair of Israel’s Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Prohibition Authority, said Al-Qard al-Hasan has become Hezbollah’s principal financial institution, responsible for safeguarding some $750 million a year in Iranian funding, as well as the proceeds from the organization’s criminal enterprises that are used to finance its attacks on Israel.</p><p>In a statement following Sunday’s attacks, Israel’s military said that the banking association “directly funds Hezbollah’s terror activities,” including the purchase of “weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah’s military wing.” The strikes, it added, are part of Israel’s efforts to “degrade Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure, its military capabilities and ability to rebuild.”</p><h2 id="link-19265d19">What is the impact of the strikes?</h2><p>On Monday, the immediate damage from the strikes remained unclear, with no casualties reported.</p><p>Few traditional bank branches would have significant amounts of cash on hand, Ms. Wagman said. But the international sanctions against Al-Qard al-Hasan meant it was more likely that its branches might have kept physical caches of dollars, as well as the gold of its depositors. If these were destroyed in the strikes, Hezbollah’s ability to fund future attacks may be further reduced, Ms. Wagman said.</p><p>Still, she said, “We can also assume that Iran, which is the major sponsor of Hezbollah, will very soon refuel those supplies.” She noted that the psychological impact may be more enduring, serving to “further reduce the trust between Hezbollah and the Lebanese people.”</p><p>Makram Ouaiss, executive director for the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies, a Beirut-based research organization, said that Al-Qard al-Hasan probably knew it would be targeted, and likely would have moved valuables to a safe location. He also noted that most branches of Al-Qard al-Hasan in Beirut occupy the ground floor of mixed commercial and residential buildings. “This probably isn’t going to hurt Hezbollah, but it will hurt lots of Lebanese,” he said.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A damaged building in Beirut on Monday after an Israeli airstrike that targeted branches of Al-Qard al-Hassan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Wael Hamzeh/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-91c2dad">What is the economic situation in Lebanon?</h2><p>In a word, catastrophic.

Israel’s military campaign against the armed group has set off a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, displacing around a fifth of the population, and killing more than 2,400 people over the past year, according to the Lebanese health ministry.</p><div><p>“The situation has escalated out of control,” Mr. Hochstein told reporters in Beirut, the Lebanese capital. He said that the White House aimed to reach “a comprehensive agreement” that would see the full enforcement of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last major war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006.</p><p>That agreement, which called for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese military to be the only armed forces operating in southern Lebanon, is today widely considered a failure.</p><p>In the years since, Iranian-backed Hezbollah has only entrenched itself militarily along Israel’s northern border, amassing a vast arsenal of rockets and missiles. Israel, too, has long been accused of violating Lebanon’s sovereignty, even before embarking on a ground invasion this month.</p><p>The U.N. resolution “was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that no one did anything to implement it. The lack of implementation over those years contributed to the conflict that we are in today,” Mr. Hochstein said after meeting with Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, a key interlocutor between the United States and Hezbollah.</p><p>Mr. Hochstein also met on Monday with the caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, and the commander of the Lebanese armed forces.</p><p>His visit was part of a renewed flurry of U.S. diplomatic efforts in the Middle East coming this week. It follows Israel’s killing of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hezbollah’s ally Hamas, whose death the Biden administration hopes will pave the way for a cease-fire in Gaza. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was scheduled to depart later on Monday for another trip to the Middle East, which will include a stop in Israel, the State Department said.</p><p>Hopes for calm, however, appear premature. Israeli forces have continued a deadly offensive against Hamas in northern Gaza, and heavy Israeli airstrikes overnight targeted Hezbollah’s financial apparatus just hours before Mr. Hochstein’s meetings.</p><p>Even as the U.S. envoy spoke to reporters, Hezbollah continued to fire rockets toward northern Israel, following pledges by the group to intensify its attacks against Israel in the wake of Mr. Sinwar’s death.</p><p>“This is a really heartbreaking moment for me to be here in Lebanon,” Mr. Hochstein said, adding: “While we spent 11 months containing the conflict, we were not able to resolve it.”</p><p>Mr. Hochstein said on Monday that the United States would aid in Lebanon’s efforts to rebuild from Israeli attacks, but only if the U.N. resolution was fully administered to reduce the chances of conflict breaking out again.</p><p>“The world will stand by Lebanon and its leaders if they make the brave and the hard choices that are required at this time,” he said. The comments appeared to be a call for the Lebanese government to push for Hezbollah’s disarmament in southern Lebanon, and for it to deploy more Lebanese troops in its place, as stipulated by the 2006 U.N. resolution.</p><p>Hezbollah has pledged repeatedly that only an end to the war in Gaza will bring about peace. Although top Lebanese officials have said the group is on board with reviving the U.N. resolution, its leaders have publicly pledged to escalate their aerial attacks against Israel. And it remains unclear if Hezbollah would agree to withdraw from southern Lebanon — with or without a cease-fire in Gaza.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
