</span> clashed. The Korean squad was victorious in Shanghai to capture APAC&#39;s first-ever international trophy, while a group stage meeting at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions 2024</a> saw Heretics come out on top.</p>



<p>The three-map series began on Paper Rex&#39;s pick of Sunset, which was also the opening map of the teams&#39; matchup in the grand final in Toronto. A similar outcome prevailed this time, with Paper Rex riding the momentum of yet another 8-4 attacking half to round out the other side. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/9801/f0rsaken">
		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span> had yet another performance to remember on Sunset, logging a map-high 25 kills. FNATIC, taking a double-Duelist approach, played <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> on Neon. He finished with a game-high seven first bloods.</p>

<p>The second map of the series was Ascent, a map banned by Paper Rex in the previous meeting. Alfajer played Chamber, the agent he gained praise for while in Toronto. Paper Rex, meanwhile, continued with its unorthodox Viper-Omen comp, which put f0rsaken on Fade and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/13744/patmen">
		PatMen	</a>
</span> on KAY/O. The zero-Sentinel comp could not perform on the defender-sided map. FNATIC made the map theirs, winning nine rounds on their attacker side. Three on defense was all that Paper Rex could manage, meaning a dominant 13-3 outing for FNATIC brought the teams to a third map.</p>

<p>Split, the decider map, saw both teams field zero-Sentinel mirror comps with Viper-Omen, Yoru-Raze, and Fade. Another dominant attack half from FNATIC meant that FNATIC faced a 9-3 halftime deficit. The triple-headed monster of <span data-ref-id="7">

		Alfajer	</a>
</span> combined for 45 kills on attack, outnumbering Paper Rex&#39;s 27 combined on defense. While PRX won five of the first six rounds of the second half, they had too much ground to make up, falling to the EMEA giants 13-8.</p>

<p><em>A clean end for FNATIC.</em></p>

<p>FNATIC moves to the grand final, where they will either meet Gen.G for the second time in 2025, or take on familiar regional foes Team Heretics. Meanwhile, Paper Rex will meet the losing team from the other semifinal in the third-place match.</p>



<p>One of 2024&#39;s most heated matchups-turned-friendships took center stage for the right to take on FNATIC in the grand final. After the first series of bans, Team Heretics picked Ascent, a map that Gen.G has struggled with consistency issues. Team Heretics&#39; double-Duelist comp, pairing <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/18350/miniboo">
		MiniBoo	</a>
</span>&#39;s Yoru with <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/21328/wo0t">
		Wo0t	</a>
</span>&#39;s Jett, put Gen.G on their heels. Team Heretics ended their attack half with a 7-5 lead. On defense, Team Heretics made use of the defender-sided map to cruise to a 13-7 win.</p>

<p>Gen.G picked Haven, one of the staples of their map pool since the start of the 2024 season. The Korean squad played up on the defensive side, picking up seven rounds. <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/9196/t3xture">
		t3xture	</a>
</span>, on high-speed Duelist Neon, went a perfect 7-0 in first duels on defense, and kept the same energy shifting onto attack. After winning the pistol, their first of the match, and the following anti-eco, Gen.G snowballed their way to a 13-8 win on the map, forcing a map three.</p>

<p>Lotus, a popular map for both sides, was played in both of the teams&#39; previous two meetings, with Gen.G victorious in Shanghai and Team Heretics winning in Seoul. The map was as tight as it could possibly be, with both teams managing just six rounds on attack. The teams moved to overtime, where successful push-and-pull attacks saw teams exchange attack rounds through two sets of OT. Team Heretics eventually managed to fight against the tide, earning a defense round to close the lid on a 15-13 win.</p>

<p><em>Team Heretics to the grand final.</em></p>

<p>Gen.G will have felt they could do better in the pistol rounds, as they finished with a 5-1 deficit in the series. Team Heretics will move on to the grand final to play FNATIC, whom they are familiar with as regional foes in EMEA. Gen.G will play in the third-place match, also against a familiar foe in APAC giants Paper Rex.</p>
