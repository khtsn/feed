Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. Two days later, A&amp;E network <a href="https://www.aetv.com/news/duck-dynasty-the-revival-to-premiere-summer-2025-on-ae" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that it had ordered 20 new episodes of its hit 2010s reality comedy “Duck Dynasty,” titled “Duck Dynasty: The Revival.”</p><p>The network, in its official statement, did not connect the second restoration to the first. But short of ABC’s bringing Roseanne Barr’s character back from the dead to head the “Roseanne” revival, “The Conners,” it is hard to imagine another programming decision that would so glaringly declare that the times had a-changed back.</p><p>“Duck Dynasty” actually aired primarily during the Obama era, with 11 seasons beginning in 2012, and it was never overtly about politics onscreen. (Offscreen was another story; we’ll get to that.) Focused on the Robertson family of Louisiana, who made their fortune with the Duck Commander duck-call business before becoming reality stars, the series was first and above all a lighthearted family TV show.</p><p>But “Duck Dynasty” was also in many ways a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/arts/television/duck-dynasty-legacy-real-fake-and-upfront-about-it.html" title="">precursor</a> of the conservative identity politics that would sweep in after it. It was filled with cultural signifiers — beards, Bibles and buckshot — that spoke to the authenticity of rural life and the reverence for heritage. It became the focus of a controversy that previewed how central grievances over “wokeness” and “cancellation” would become to conservative politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>And it was a mass-market hit that found an audience by representing a kind of life — traditionalist, openly Christian, <em>country — </em>that was absent from much pop culture.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man in a beard and cap holds up a blue cup sitting next to a woman giving a thumbs-up sign." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl/01cul-duck-notebook-02-vbgl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d30c606f-e90c-5a93-abd8-1893e0f1a36d" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Uncle Si Robertson, with Jessica Robertson, often functioned as the show’s gonzo philosopher. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via the Robertson family/A&amp;E (inset photo)</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
