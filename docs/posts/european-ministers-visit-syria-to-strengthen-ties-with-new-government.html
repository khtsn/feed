Earlier in the day they visited the notorious Sednaya prison, where Mr. al-Assad’s regime <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/middleeast/syria-sednaya-prison-assad-atrocities.html" title="">tortured and killed thousands</a> of detainees.</p><p>“We are traveling to Damascus today to offer our support, but also with clear expectations of the new rulers,” Ms. Baerbock said in a statement before the meeting. “A new beginning can only happen if all Syrians, no matter their ethnicity and religion, are given a place in the political process.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The visits are among a flurry of contacts between rebel leaders and Western officials looking to gradually open channels to the new Syrian authorities. Mr. al-Shara has worked to project a moderate image since taking power.</p><p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is still blacklisted as a terrorist group by the United States and the United Nations because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">its past ties to Al Qaeda</a>. Mr. al-Shara has called on the international community to remove that designation and sought to reassure minority groups, saying he wants to focus on rebuilding Syria after years of civil war.</p><p>“The current events demand the lifting of all sanctions on Syria,” he said in a televised interview last month.</p><p>The diplomacy comes during a realignment across the Middle East, where Mr. al-Assad’s regime was a core part of Iran’s regional coalition. His family’s decades of iron-fisted rule were opposed by many Syrians, spurring the 2011 uprising and civil war. At least six foreign militaries were involved in the country’s nearly 14-year civil war, including those from Iran, Russia and Turkey.</p><p>Many countries — including the United States — have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/us/politics/us-diplomats-syria.html" title="">begun forging ties with the new government</a>. In late December, Barbara Leaf, the senior State Department official for the Middle East, met with Mr. al-Shara in Damascus and told him that Washington would no longer pursue an outstanding bounty for his arrest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Friday, Mr. Barrot also visited the site of the disused French embassy in Damascus, which was closed in 2012 as the civil war escalated, the French Foreign Ministry said. During the visit, Mr. Barrot said he hoped to work toward reopening the embassy, according to a French diplomat familiar with the trip who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to comply with government protocol.</p><p>Some Syrians — particularly Christians and other minority groups — are uncertain about Mr. al-Shara, pointing to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s conservative Islamist roots. In Idlib, a province controlled by the group since 2017, its leaders banned alcohol and opened a chain of free religious schools. But Mr. al-Shara’s faction has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/middleeast/rebels-syria-governing-style-idlib.html" title="">eschewed</a> the draconian decrees and brutal punishments of extremists like the Taliban and the Islamic State.</p><p>Officials in Hayat Tahrir al-Sham have laid out an ambitious plan for establishing a new government, and rebel leaders have assumed key positions to oversee a transition. They say they intend to establish a caretaker government in consultation with Syrians of all backgrounds, as well as a committee to draft a new Syrian constitution.</p><p>Many in the region are also wary of the new Syrian government, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/world/middleeast/syria-saudi-arabia-uae.html" title="">including</a> Gulf States like the United Arab Emirates, which has long tried to prevent the rise of groups that embrace political Islam, as well as Israel.</p><p>Overnight on Friday, Israeli warplanes bombed Syrian defense research sites near Aleppo, <a href="https://www.syriahr.com/%d8%b3%d8%b1%d8%a8-%d8%b7%d8%a7%d8%a6%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a5%d8%b3%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%a6%d9%8a%d9%84%d9%8a-%d9%8a%d8%b4%d9%86-%d8%ba%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89-%d9%85%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%85/743726/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israel declined to comment on the report.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes against Syrian military sites since the fall of Mr. al-Assad in an effort to eliminate sophisticated arms like chemical weapons and long-range missiles. Mr. al-Shara has said he will uphold a longstanding cease-fire agreement with Israel, saying that Syria poses no threat to its neighbors.</p><p>Here are other developments in the region:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Houthi missile attacks: </strong>The Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen launched a ballistic missile at Israel before dawn on Friday, setting off air-raid sirens across central Israel, including in Jerusalem. The Israeli military said it had intercepted the missile and there were no reports of serious casualties. Israeli fighter jets have flown over 1,000 miles to strike Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen but Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-houthis-yemen.html" title="">struggled to stop</a> the attacks, which have escalated over the past month.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli strikes in Lebanon: </strong>The Israeli military said on Thursday night that it had bombed Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon, while a 60-day truce <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-ceasefire.html" title="">largely continues to hold</a>. Since the agreement went into effect in late November, Israel has repeatedly bombarded what it says are Hezbollah fighters violating the agreement. Hezbollah has generally refrained from responding militarily. The current cease-fire is set to expire in late January, although the United States and its allies hope it becomes permanent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza war: </strong>Despite tentative optimism for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-cease-fire-trump.html" title="">a cease-fire in Gaza</a> last month amid last-minute efforts by the Biden administration to reach a deal, the war has persisted. On Friday, the Israeli military said that over the past day it had struck roughly 40 targets in Gaza, which it said were affiliated with Hamas.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
