		<p>Week 2 of the Americas playoffs is underway, with Sentinels and G2 Esports taking wins today. With their win G2 become the third and final team from Americas to qualify to Masters Toronto.</p>



<p>The first match of the day pitted two teams that have been on a tear recently. Both suffered losses in week two, and then have been on winning streaks ever since. Sentinels were coming off the back of finally beating the best of Americas in G2, while MIBR had an uncontested path through 100T and <span data-ref-id="0">

<p>As it was during their Kickoff match, Sentinels once again had MIBR&#39;s number. Their consistent star zekken led them to a 2-0 victory. The first map was a 13-7 stomp, and while MIBR did their best to make the second map close, it was only a matter of time before Sentinels took it across the line.</p>



<p>Sentinels will now go on to their second Americas grand final this year, while MIBR will go down to the lower final.</p>



<p>The most important match of the evening came from EG taking on G2 for the final spot at Toronto. This matchup was a revenge game for both icy and Evil Geniuses, the former of whom was dropped from G2, while the ladder had jawgemo leave them to join G2.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, this match would&#39;ve been all but guaranteed for G2. However, with G2&#39;s looking vulnerable against Sentinels and 100T and EG on the rise, there was some belief for the upset.</p>

<p>EG proved they were capable of taking down the big dogs when they won map one of Lotus. The started their attack side keeping it close, but once jawgemo got the Operator out, G2 snowballed into an 8-4 half lead.</p>

<p>On EG&#39;s defense side however, they were dominant. After supamen and yay won a crucial thrifty round, seven more rounds in a row took them to a 13-9 map win. G2 kept many rounds close, but it was EG that always clutched them out. </p>


<p><em>The dynamic duo of supamen and yay sat atop the scoreboard at the end of Lotus.</em></p>


<p><em>PRIME YAY TIES IT UP.</em></p>

<p>G2 reminded everyone who they were in map two where they swept EG to the tune of 13-7. leaf dropped a bomb on Viper, with a 1.78 rating on the map. Most of EG&#39;s rounds came off of hero rounds and low buys.</p>

<p>This only left Pearl to decide who would go to Toronto. The first half was a back and forth affair, but EG pulled ahead with a 7-5 lead. In the second half, the teams systematically traded two rounds at a time, all the way up to 11-11. Even when G2 were on a low buy, they found insane ways to pull rounds out of nowhere. Evocative of their match against 100T, G2 would not go quietly into the night. </p>


<p><em>G2 pull off an insane thrifty round when they need it the most.</em></p>

<p>Finally, G2 broke the cycle, going up to match point at 12-11. With EG on a low buy, G2 found the final round to at last qualify to Toronto.</p>

<p>G2 will face MIBR tomorrow in the lower final for a chance to face Sentinels in the grand final.</p>
