    <h1>After Death of ‘KShakes,’ NYC Street Dancers Shake Off Grief</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Curtis Small took his place in front of the video camera as an ethereal portrait of his son K’Sean lit a screen on the wall behind him. He was flanked by about 20 dancers, who steeled themselves. In this big, open room, on the main floor of a mental health services center, many of them had competed against Small’s son, or traded dance steps with him, or just watched over the years as the lanky, quick-witted kid from Brooklyn made a name for himself in Harlem, one battle, one party, one joke at a time.</p><p>K’Sean Nurse, known as KShakes, had used his long, wiry limbs, humor and keen timing to cultivate a distinctive dance style that captivated audiences on social media and in concert venues. He danced for artists including King Combs, G. Dep, Busta Rhymes, Lady London and the Lost Boyz. Nurse’s stage name derived from his finding fresh nuance in the Harlem Shake — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/nyregion/behind-harlem-shake-craze-a-dance-thats-over-a-decade-old.html" title="">the real one</a> — with fine control that could render the dance spastic or billowing in service of the song. His shoulders rolled for R&amp;B and quivered for hip-hop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/multimedia/23KSHAKES-04-ztlv/23KSHAKES-04-ztlv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/multimedia/23KSHAKES-04-ztlv/23KSHAKES-04-ztlv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/multimedia/23KSHAKES-04-ztlv/23KSHAKES-04-ztlv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A man wearing a colorful long-sleeved shirt, jeans and a baseball cap, jumps high to perform a dance move.

Police are still investigating. Since then, this tight-knit family has sought catharsis in a handful of tributary dance gatherings in the parks and community centers where their culture thrives, like Union Settlement in Harlem, the site of the Teen Night workshops and battles where KShakes honed his talent.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>More than a month after his death, roughly 150 dancers, family and friends convened at Union Settlement to film the video for “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0JZLB5WiydpLrOLasyzVpQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shakes</a>,” an elegy performed by Small under his rap name, Bakeman Global. The song, which has gained airplay on New York’s Hot 97, has the bouncy feel of a live event and drums that evoke handclaps. Before filming began, Mr. Small addressed the group: “I thought I could do this, but it’s still kind of hard, you know? I need y’all to carry me.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tatianna Butler, the video’s director and an organizer of Teen Night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elias Williams for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>With cameras rolling, Ohana, KShakes’s 3-year-old daughter, pranced into the shot and began to dance. Mr. Small dabbed at his eyes. The dancers closed in even tighter around him, resting hands on his back.</p><p>Tatianna Butler, the video&#39;s director, called for a round of takes to focus on the All In, a step KShakes popularized through a viral <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kshakes_allin/video/6913291550474636549?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7428232916369409579" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TikTok challenge</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4Flgc0mKzOc6d52s3Tu0EZ?si=bfe2c364afbf4324" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a song of his own</a>.

He shrunk away after the take. Butler noticed his heavy breathing and reddened eyes and walked over to offer a hug.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Dancing, for me right now, is in a space where, if it’s not in tribute for him, I don’t want to do it,” Primus said. “It feels pointless without him here.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tillery took to the floor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elias Williams for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ryan Primus, a friend and protégé of KShakes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elias Williams for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>KShakes was especially beloved by dancers in the hyperkinetic Litefeet form, whose moves are often canonized and named for their originators. He was equally revered by the fluttering, free-form stylists known as the Shakers, whose most popular cultural export remains the Harlem Shake. Though both styles originated Uptown, their adjacent cultures are territorial.</p><p>His friends say one of KShakes’s proudest moments was being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6HH04DWP0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presented</a> the Shaker of the Year award by Maurice “Motion” Strayhorne, who helped popularize the Harlem Shake in the early 2000s. By bringing a Shaker’s approach to crowd interaction and improvisation into Litefeet spaces, KShakes brought dancers from both styles together “because he was deeply socially respected in both camps,” said Amanda Adams-Louis. Adams-Louis, a documentarian with Kut the Rug Institute, has photographed New York City’s dance cultures for two decades. At the video shoot, she navigated the cellphone-wielding spectators, squeezing her camera into the tight dancers’ circles or standing on folding chairs to shoot them from above.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A T-shirt tribute to KShakes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elias Williams for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“We really lost a good one,” said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/30/magazine/subway-dance-new-york.html" title="">Ikeem Jones</a>, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMS_ZrTDDK4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spirited battles</a> with KShakes are lore in the street dance world. “His style influenced others,” he said. “You’ll see people doing the Milly Rock and All In exactly like how he’s doing it<em>.</em></p><p>Once the shoot ended, dancers spilled into the courtyard outside the community center. Someone set up a telescoping LED light above the scene that cycled red, orange and green every few minutes. A sped up, bass-heavy remix of Maxwell’s “Ascension (Don’t Ever Wonder)” rumbled out of a Bluetooth speaker. Freed of the directions tossed around on the shoot, the dancers erupted in ciphers. Jones went into frenzied splits, rocking his shoulders.</p><p>Elijah Soto, KShakes’s friend and partner in the Team Rocket dance collective, stood by the exit doors, hugging everyone who passed.</p><p><strong>“</strong>I’m all cried out,” Soto said. “There’s nothing left to do but dance in celebration of my brother.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>James Thomas is a software engineer in the Interactive News department, a team that creates tools used by reporters and editors to produce Times journalism.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/james-thomas">More about James Thomas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
