    <h1>U.S. to Deploy Missile Defense System and About 100 Troops to Israel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was not immediately clear when the missile defense system and troops announced on Sunday would arrive in Israel.</p><p>“This action underscores the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran,” the statement said. “It is part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months to support the defense of Israel and protect Americans from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias.”</p><p>While the THAAD system represents the first U.S. troop deployment to Israel since the war in Gaza began, the U.S. military did build a temporary pier off the coast of Gaza in May meant to rush humanitarian aid to the enclave. The pier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/us/politics/gaza-pier-aid.html" title="">was dismantled in July</a> after weeks of damage from rough seas.</p><p>And late last month, the Pentagon said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-deploys-troops-middle-east.html" title="">it would send a “few thousand”</a> American troops to the Middle East as Israel intensified its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon, with one official putting the figure between 2,000 and 3,000. The United States also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/world/middleeast/patriot-israel-hamas-iran-gaza-eisenhower-pentagon.html" title="">sent a THAAD battery along with other air defense systems</a> to the region weeks after the attacks on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>On Saturday Mr. Austin spoke with Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, and “expressed his deep concern about reports that Israeli forces fired on U.N. peacekeeping positions in Lebanon as well as by the reported death of two Lebanese soldiers,” the Pentagon said in a statement about the call.</p></div></div>
