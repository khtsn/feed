Shots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Oregon after midnight on Thursday. Arrests were made at a nonviolent protest at a Tesla dealership in Lower Manhattan on Saturday.</p><p>The electric car company Tesla increasingly found itself in police blotters across the country this week, more than seven weeks after President Trump’s second inauguration swept Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, into the administration as a senior adviser to the president.</p><p>Mr. Musk, 53, is drawing increasing backlash for his sweeping cuts to federal agencies, a result of the newly formed cost-cutting initiative Mr. Musk has labeled the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/musk-federal-bureaucracy-takeover.html" title="">Department of Government Efficiency</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>During a demonstration on Saturday at a gleaming Tesla showroom in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan, protesters joined in chants of “Nobody voted for Elon Musk” and “Oligarchs out, democracy in.” One held a sign saying, “Send Musk to Mars Now!!” (Mr. Musk also owns SpaceX.)</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shots were fired at the Tesla dealership in Tigard, Ore., this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tigard Police Department</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Several hundred protesters remained there for two hours, organizers said, blocking entrances and shutting down the dealership.</p><p>Some protesters entered the building, and six were arrested, said Alice Hu, an organizer. The New York Police Department said that five people had been issued summonses for disorderly conduct, while one faced a charge of resisting arrest.</p><p>The demonstration came at the end of a week in which employees at a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Ore., near Portland, arrived at work on Thursday and found gunshot damage.</p><p>The police said they believed that at least seven shots had been fired, damaging three cars and shattering windows. One bullet went through a wall and into a computer monitor, the police said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And on Monday, seven Tesla charging stations were intentionally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tesla-boycott-elon-musk.html" title="">set on fire</a> at a shopping center outside Boston, the police said. In another Boston suburb, the police <a href="https://x.com/BrooklineMAPD/status/1897458245326790928" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested</a> a man on Wednesday who had <a href="https://brookline.news/brookline-police-say-several-teslas-were-vandalized-with-elon-musk-stickers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tagged</a> six Tesla vehicles with decals of Mr. Musk in a raised-arm pose.</p><p>The police in Brookline, Mass. released a <a href="https://x.com/BrooklineMAPD/status/1896985826489516309" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> of the man saying that he had the right to deface the cars because it was his “free speech.” When Mr. Musk saw the video, he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1897067561264800076" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responded</a>, “Damaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech!”</p><p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday about the protest and vandalism.</p><p>In Colorado on Thursday, federal prosecutors charged a person with malicious destruction of property. She is accused of spray-painting “Nazi” onto the side of a Tesla dealership and planting a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle, according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-co/pr/lyons-resident-charged-connection-series-incidents-loveland-tesla-dealership" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news release</a> from the United States attorney in Colorado.</p><p>At Mr. Trump’s inauguration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/elon-musk-roman-salute-nazi.html" title="">Mr. Musk slapped</a> his right hand on his chest before shooting his arm diagonally upward, palm facing down, a gesture that resembled a salute used in Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. But Mr. Musk responded in <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1881536518206218445?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X</a>: “The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.”</p><p>On Tuesday in Salem, Ore., a man was arrested and charged with <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/crime/oregon-throw-molotov-cocktails-tesla-dealership-salem-03052025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">setting fires</a> in front of a Tesla dealership and to a Tesla car in the lot on the day of the inauguration, causing at least $500,000 worth of damage, the authorities said.

The police in Germany said that they were investigating it as an arson.</p><p>And in France, a dozen Tesla cars <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250303-dozen-teslas-torched-outside-french-dealership-authorities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were set on fire</a> near the southern city of Toulouse on Sunday night.
