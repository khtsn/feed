Trump.</p><p>“My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics,” he said in his last statement as president. “Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end.”</p><p>Mr. Biden’s action pardoned James B. Biden, his brother; Sara Jones Biden, James’s wife; Valerie Biden Owens, Mr. Biden’s sister; John T. Owens, Ms. Owens’s husband; and Francis W. Biden, Mr. Biden’s brother.</p><p>The White House announced the pardons with less than 20 minutes left in Mr. Biden’s presidency, after he had already walked into the Capitol Rotunda to witness the swearing-in of Mr. Trump before leaving the Capitol for the last time as president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The pardons were a remarkable coda to Mr. Biden’s 50-year political career, underscoring the mistrust and anger that the president feels about Mr. Trump, the man who preceded and will succeed him in office.</p><p>Mr. Biden had repeatedly warned that Mr. Trump was a threat to democracy in America. But he also said that he believed in the rule of law, and was confident in the stability of the institutions of law enforcement. The pardons — like one that he did earlier for his son, Hunter Biden, threatened to challenge that assertion.</p><p>In his statement, Mr. Biden explained his action.</p><p>”I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics,” Mr. Biden wrote. “But baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finances.”</p><p>Mr. Biden also commuted the life sentence for Leonard Peltier, the Native American activist who was convicted of killing two F.B.I. agents in 1975 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Mr. Biden said that his action would allow Mr. Peltier, who is 80 years old, to serve the remainder of his time in home confinement.</p><p>In his statement, White House officials noted that “Tribal nations, Nobel Peace laureates, former law enforcement officials (including the former U.S. attorney whose office oversaw Mr. Peltier’s prosecution and appeal), dozens of lawmakers, and human rights organizations strongly support granting Mr. Peltier clemency, citing his advanced age, illnesses, his close ties to and leadership in the Native American community and the substantial length of time he has already spent in prison.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The president also pardoned two Democratic politicians, Ernest William Cromartie, a former city councilman in South Carolina, and Gerald G. Lundergan, a state legislator from Kentucky. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
