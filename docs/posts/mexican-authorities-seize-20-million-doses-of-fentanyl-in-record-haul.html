He has threatened extreme tariffs on the country’s exports to the United States and even challenged Mexican sovereignty by proposing U.S. military strikes against drug cartels there.</p><p>“Trump’s threats, without a doubt, have set the wheels spinning,” said Eduardo Guerrero, a Mexico-based security consultant. “All of this is being done to arrive at the negotiating table with Trump’s security team with a portfolio of achievements.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mexico can achieve two goals, he added: “It can help the United States in terms of migration and fentanyl, and at the same time, with those same operations, it could begin to pacify some parts of the country.”</p><p>The new administration has put a major emphasis on intelligence, said Josué Ángel González Torres, a security analyst in Mexico City who has previously worked for Mexican security and intelligence agencies. It has also strengthened coordination between federal security forces and the country’s attorney general, local police officers and prosecutors, he said.</p><p>Mexico’s previous president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, avoided direct confrontations with criminals and instead focused on addressing the root causes of violence, such as poverty — a policy enshrined in the slogan “hugs, not bullets.” The approach had some success, but it failed to significantly decrease bloodshed across Mexico, government data shows.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum, speaking in Mexico City in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luis Antonio Rojas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>It’s too soon to see whether Ms. Sheinbaum has departed from this security policy, but some analysts said there are hints of a more heavy-handed approach.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I no longer hear the ‘hugs, not bullets’ saying,” Mr. González Torres said. “There are substantive changes that seem to be positive.”</p><p>In Tuesday’s operation, Mexican authorities said patrol officers saw some men carrying what appeared to be firearms fleeing into two houses in Ahome, a municipality in Sinaloa. The authorities entered the properties and found a combined 1,100 kilos of fentanyl, plus the equipment used to make it.</p><p>The second, smaller, operation occurred in Guasave, a municipality in Sinaloa. There, Mexican authorities said that officers spotted a car whose two occupants tried to flee. The officers caught up with the vehicle, stopped it and searched it. They found three firearms, nine loaded magazines, radio communication equipment and two kilograms of fentanyl pills, officials said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>James Wagner covers Latin America, including sports, and is based in Mexico City.
