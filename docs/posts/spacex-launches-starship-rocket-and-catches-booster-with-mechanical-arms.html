It nestled against the arms, which closed gently around the booster, catching it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When the engines switched off, the booster was still hanging in midair.</p><p>“I don’t know what to say!” Gwynne Shotwell, the chief operating officer of SpaceX, said in <a href="https://x.com/gwynne_shotwell/status/1845447217982865501?s=42" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a posting on X</a>.</p><p>A small fire continued to burn at the base of the booster, but the flames soon extinguished.</p><p>The return of the booster to the launch site was similar to how the first stage of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket re-enters the atmosphere before landing on a floating platform or a landing pad. SpaceX now does that routinely, but the boosters still have to be brought back to the launch site.</p><p>Mr. Musk envisions that Starships will be able to fly much more often, so SpaceX built a tower with mechanical arms nicknamed chopsticks. SpaceX also plans to use those arms to catch Starships when they return from orbit.</p><p>While the launch tower caught the booster in Texas, the upper-stage Starship vehicle continued on an arc into space toward the Indian Ocean. For this flight, SpaceX improved the thermal protection on Starship so that it could better withstand the searing heat of re-entry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>At least one of the flaps looked like it suffered some damage during re-entry, but Starship survived intact as it performed a soft landing on the water.

Trump</a>. He appeared beside Mr. Trump at a rally this month in Butler, Pa., wearing a shirt that said “Occupy Mars,” and has asserted that Mr. Trump is the only candidate who will get humanity to Mars.</p><p>To get to Mars — or even land on the moon — SpaceX has more technical challenges to master. They include speeding up the pace of launches and demonstrating the ability to refill Starship’s propellant tanks while in orbit.</p><p>Mr. Musk is promising that the first Starships to Mars will depart in late 2026, the next time that Earth and Mars line up, and that if those initial landings go well, crewed flights will follow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The sonic booms, which the Federal Aviation Administration had predicted when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/faa-spacex-starship-license.html" title="">granting SpaceX permission to launch</a>, could add another issue of contention among the agency, SpaceX and environmentalists who say that not enough is being done to protect people, property and wildlife from the launches.</p><p>Those complaints could grow as SpaceX is seeking permission to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/08/01/2024-16983/notice-of-availability-notice-of-public-comment-period-notice-of-public-meetings-and-request-for" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increase the number of Starship launches</a> at its Texas site from five orbital launches a year to 25.</p><p>But SpaceX says regulators were hindering its progress, with this fifth test flight of Starship delayed for months by bureaucratic sluggishness. The F.A.A. says it is working to protect public safety. At one point, the agency said it wouldn’t <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-five-late-november" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approve Sunday’s flight</a> until late November, with a sign-off from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on environmental issues at the Texas launch site a factor in the delay.</p><p>There has been widespread evidence of environmental consequences to the region, as detailed in a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/us/politics/spacex-wildlife-texas.html" title="">investigation published in July.</a></p><p>After weeks of pressure by Mr. Musk, F.A.A. approval came Saturday for the flight on Sunday. But some environmental caveats were attached.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The F.A.A. said SpaceX had agreed to conduct studies of pea-size gravel the rocket sends into the adjacent state park “<a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/85696#page=14" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to determine the distance of the gravel plume</a> and methods for protecting nests during launch events.”</p><p>SpaceX will also use drones with infrared cameras — which can detect animal nesting sites — during launches, and it will deploy environmental engineers before and after the launches to look for any harm to these birds and their nests.</p><p>The company may also be asked, if the Fish and Wildlife Service approves, to install temporary shelters to protect the nests during launches.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The sun sets behind SpaceX’s Starship in Boca Chica on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Gay/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>In public filings, the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/85696#page=8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.A.A. had said</a> that the air pressure, noise and sonic booms all would be more intense during Sunday’s test. During earlier flights, the booster descended over the Gulf of Mexico, much farther from homes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The air pressure, the F.A.A. said in a report made public Saturday, would be <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/85696#page=10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly strong enough</a> to potentially cause minor damage to older plaster on homes not far from the launch site.</p><p>Planned post-flight inspections will show if the event caused any damage, and if so, how widespread it was. SpaceX, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/85696#page=11" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the F.A.A. said</a>, has insurance to cover the cost of any required structural repairs.</p><p>Valerie Bates, a manager at the Port Isabel Lighthouse State Historic Site, which is about six miles from the launch site, said the Sunday flight was noticeably stronger, at least to her, than earlier launches once the landing was included.</p><p>The sound during liftoff is always long and rumbling, she said, but the vibrations were more intense as the booster returned, although there was no apparent damage to the lighthouse. She said some neighbors reported items falling off walls.</p><p>“This was clearly different,” she said, adding that she was at the lighthouse for the event. “There were two to three really strong booms at the landing that felt more impactful. It was stronger, it was louder.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Not all area residents reported more intense disruptions.</p><p>Keith Reynolds, who lives four miles from the launch site, said the vibrations and noise were not that different to him than they were during previous launches, and he did not see any damage to his house.</p><p>“It was an incredible feat,” he said. “I’m ready for the next one and 100 more.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eric Lipton is an investigative reporter, who digs into a broad range of topics from Pentagon spending to toxic chemicals.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-lipton">More about Eric Lipton</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/spacex">SpaceX</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-aeronautics-and-space-administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What’s Up in Space and Astronomy</h2><h3>Keep track of things going on in our solar system and all around the universe.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other 2024 event that’s out of this world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2024/01/01/science/astronomy-space-calendar">our space and </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2024/01/01/science/astronomy-space-calendar">astronomy calendar</a>.</p></li><li><p>Astronomers spotted a potential Earth-size rocky world orbiting a white dwarf, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/science/planet-white-dwarf.html">suggesting a future in which our planet outlives its star</a> and challenging the theory that the sun will destroy Earth.</p></li><li><p>Astronomers have discovered a black hole emitting energy in jets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/science/space/black-hole-m87-energy.html">longer than the width of 140 Milky Way galaxies</a>.
