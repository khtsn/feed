As is typical of such occasions, the drinks were free, the bites small and the musical talent high-caliber, with Tierra Whack and En Vogue performing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>A mixture of art, tech and music types bemoaned that they needed jackets in the 60-degree weather as they roamed between the open bar and a grassy hill, waiting for the show to start. <a href="https://womeninvinyl.com/profiles/lolo-reskin-owner-sweat-records" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lolo Reskin</a>, who owns Sweat Records, a Miami vinyl shop, said Basel was still more opportunity than annoyance for locals.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>En Vogue performed at a party celebrating a collaboration between Google and the artist Derrick Adams.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Adams, who created T-shirts and tote bags in collaboration with Google Shopping.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Some of the best art, people-watching and music comes right to our door,” she said. “If you don’t want to take advantage, then don’t, but there’s lots to do.”</p><p>“It’s a mess to be a resident of the city during this week,” countered Greg Bloom, a consultant and Ms. Reskin’s boyfriend. “And when you go and participate, it’s very rare that I see something where I’m like, the world is a better place for this thing being in it.”</p><p>As Ms. Whack began singing, the artist Michele Pred, 59, stood by the bar holding a red vinyl handbag she had designed featuring the words “We Shall Overcome” in glowing blue lettering. Ms. Pred, who described herself as an activist, felt unnerved by the lack of political engagement she’d observed among fairgoers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I think everyone’s left that at home,” she said. “I can’t leave that at home as a political artist.”</p><p>Ms. Pred had organized for later in the week a “Feminist Beach Party,” where an inflatable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/health/abortion-misoprostol.html" title="">misoprostol pill</a> would appear and attendees would write postcards urging President Biden to make the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/democrats-equal-rights-amendment.html" title="">Equal Rights Amendment</a> law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The artist Michele Pred’s “Feminist Beach Party&#34; for abortion access on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A handbag designed by Ms. Pred.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A global warming caution tape dress designed by the Brooklyn artist Michael Seri.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Adams’s and Google’s event began to wind down, and many conversations revolved, as they often do during Art Week, around where everyone would go next.</p><p>One option was down the street, to a V.I.P. opening at The Bass, where a queue stretched deep into Collins Park.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Another was farther afield, at the venue ZeyZey in Miami’s Little River neighborhood. There, the musician Helado Negro, who grew up in Miami, sang acoustic ballads in a mix of Spanish and English for a more local crowd. Fans regularly shushed talkers, hoping to soak in every whispery note. They were happy where they were.</p><p>The following evening, at one of the fashion activations Mr. Moch had warned against, staff members and journalists at Miu Miu’s Design District store buzzed with mild anxiety as they awaited the appearance of the supermodel Gigi Hadid.</p><p>“Where’s the photographer, where’s the photographer?” a man repeatedly asked the room until, after several minutes, someone with a camera appeared and took pictures of espresso martinis and Cosmopolitans.</p><p>The location of the event’s numerous photographers was in no question when Ms. Hadid arrived around 7 p.m. Dressed in a pinstripe jacket and a pearl necklace, Ms. Hadid sat at a table in the back of the store’s ground floor, posing and signing clothing tags for a collection of Miu Miu Select pieces she had curated.</p><p>“This is actually my first time at Art Basel,” Ms. Hadid said. “I’ve never actually gone into the galleries and stuff, but next time hopefully I’ll come to do more of that.”</p><p>As attendees strove to get a glimpse of Ms. Hadid in action, the actress and “Real Housewives” star Garcelle Beauvais, wearing a sky blue dress, stood near a shoe display, smiling and chatting about her charity work and a gallery visit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-19"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gigi Hadid, clad in Miu Miu.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Garcelle Beauvais, a “Real Housewives” star who attended Ms. Hadid’s event.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Also present was the writer Drew Zeiba, who, glass in hand, dryly commented, “I love to drink cocktails in a store.”</p><p>Across the bay, a party for Grey Goose Altius, the brand’s new premium vodka, was underway at a santal-scented private villa on the water. Outside, partygoers danced at the head of a pool while a lifeguard swayed nearby. Closer to the house, a man applied power tools to a branded, wall-like ice sculpture situated between palm trees.</p><p>The event formalized, for the span of a few hours, the relationship between Diplo, its headlining D.J., and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/12/style/mschf-global-supply-chain-telephone-bag.html" title="">MSCHF</a>, the experimental creative collective. Kevin Wiesner and Lukas Bentel, the group’s chief creative officers, had brought along a blue edition of their hit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/style/mschf-big-red-boots.html" title="">Big Red Boots</a>, among other works.</p><p>Wearing sneakers of their own design, they spoke at length about their practice, the fairs and the mood at Basel.</p><p>“The Trump election — hey, it’s boom time for rich people, baby,” Mr. Wiesner joked. “That’ll probably take the art market back up with it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Later in the night, at El Palenque, a Latin club a few miles away, in Miami proper, the artist and director Harmony Korine was throwing a party for his studio EDGLRD to introduce its skateboarding division and premiere a skate film, “Point Cloud.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Watching “Point Cloud,” the artist and director Harmony Korine’s new film.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-24"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kevin Wiesner and Lukas Bentel, the chief creative officers of MSCHF.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The filmmaker Harmony Korine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Shouting over the pounding club music, Mr. Korine said he was inspired by, among other things, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/arts/brain-rot-oxford-word.html" title="">“brain rot.”</a></p><p>When the video came on, the crowd hollered as skateboarders, including Elijah Odom, landed tricks or wiped out onscreen. As Alphaville’s “Forever Young” scored the film’s final stretch, some people clustered around Mr. Korine — a 51-year-old father of three who has been hailed as a creative genius since his early 20s — tilted their heads back and sang the song’s refrain: “I wanna be forever young.”</p><p>Afterward, as Mr. Korine and others D.J.ed, and revelers danced and waved branded boards around the crowd, Charlie Freiberg, a publicist, reflected on her experiences talking with A.I. chatbots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“It’s over, it’s over,” she said of the world as we know it. “So it’s also just beginning.”</p><p>By Friday, Art Basel, too, was both over and just beginning. The V.I.P.-only days, when gallerists do the bulk of their business, had concluded on Thursday, and the first of three public days — when anyone with a ticket can browse the sprawling fair — had commenced.</p><p>In the booth for Mai 36 Galerie, an H.R. Giger sculpture of a xenomorph, one of the nightmarish monsters the Swiss artist created for the “Alien<em>”</em> film franchise, menaced passers-by.</p><p>The creature had sold for less than the asking price of $1 million, to an American collector who received a courtesy discount, according to Henri Gisler, the 33-year-old director of the gallery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Miami Beach Convention Center, which featured works from almost 300 galleries.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A sculpture by H.R.

Like many other current and former residents I spoke to, Dani Jane, 31, a Los Angeles-based stylist and dancer from Miami, and Anna Monet, 29, who works in hospitality in Miami, liked the parties and the art but weren’t so sure about the people who flew in for the fair each year.</p><p>“I think they’re super rude,” Ms. Monet said. “I hear what they say, and they’re really talking down on Miami.”</p><p>All of these goings-on would have been plenty for most people, but I was drawn back out on Saturday night to the design fair by a force even more confounding than wealth or traffic: superstardom. ASAP Rocky and Rihanna were hosting a party of about 100, including Joe Jonas and DJ Khaled, to fete Mr. Rocky, whose design studio, Hommemade, was sharing a display booth with the Italian firm Gufram.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-33"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>DJ Khaled, who attended a Design Miami party hosted by Rihanna and ASAP Rocky.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I love to see his art,” Rihanna said of Mr. Rocky.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martina Tuaty for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Pointing at two satellite-shaped movie projectors that doubled as lamps, Mr. Rocky, his eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses, said the collection was inspired by “the point of view of a satellite,” a vantage perhaps appropriate given his rarefied celebrity.</p><p>What’s on the horizon for Mr. Rocky, who has two young children with Rihanna? “Design,” he said. “I think home ware’s the new vibe. It’s the new direction with everything.”</p><p>Asked what she thought of Mr. Rocky’s work, Rihanna, wearing a short Margiela dress and ripped tights, raised an eyebrow and smiled. “What do I think about my man’s work? Are you kidding me? I’d never let you all see if I didn’t love it,” she said.</p><p>“I love to be a spectator,” she said. “I love to see his art, his eyes, his lens — something like this.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>An Unlikely ‘It’ Building: </strong>The WSA building, a 31-story Manhattan office tower with mysterious financing, has become an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/style/wsa-building.html">improbable hub for artists, designers and influencers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fashion’s Last Great Weirdo: </strong>With a new store in Los Angeles, a Levi’s collaboration and a growing international presence, Kiko Kostadinov is building that rarest thing in fashion: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/style/kiko-kostadinov-mens-wear.html">an independent, family-run empire</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finding Love Gets Personal: </strong>In a landscape of dating app fatigue and romance scams, the anachronistic-seeming personals section — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/style/seven-days-personals-vermont.html">which is thriving in Vermont</a> — can look like the way of the dating future.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Menswear Dog’ Dies: </strong>Bodhi, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/style/bodhi-menswear-dog-dies.html">a Shiba Inu of uncommon sartorial panache</a>, modeled for Coach and was the subject of his own fashion lookbook.</p></li><li><p><strong>Target’s Hot Santa: </strong>A new series of ads from the retailer features Kris K., a “weirdly hot” version of the beloved character, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/style/target-hot-santa-ads.html">continuing a trend of spicing up holiday favorites</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
