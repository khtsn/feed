The individuals were rescued and did not suffer serious injuries, according to the city’s mayor.</p><p>Dangerous surf pounded California beaches on Monday with waves up to 40 feet tall, and they were even bigger in some locations, including the Mavericks surf break off Half Moon Bay, a spot known for its big waves, 15 miles south of San Francisco. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Weather Service extended a <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=MTR&amp;wwa=high%20surf%20warning" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high surf warning</a> through 6 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday for coastal areas in the greater Bay Area, stretching from the Sonoma Coast to Monterey Bay.

The event rarely happens and only takes place when the conditions are just right.</p><p>Driven by hurricane-force winds, the storm churned up ocean waters before it eventually pushed across British Columbia, said Roger Gass, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Monterey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We are expected to have treacherous wave conditions continue through much of the week,” Mr. Gass said.</p><p>Mark Sponsler, a San Francisco-based surfer who runs the site <a href="http://www.stormsurf.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stormsurf</a>, said Monday’s conditions were dangerously powerful. He said he surfed near Pacifica on Monday, along the coast just south of San Francisco.</p><p>“It was like small tidal waves coming in,” Mr. Sponsler said. “Like the whole bay would drain out and then a massive wave would come up. The whole bay was undulating in and out. We only stayed out for 15 minutes and then we got out and said, ‘This is too dangerous.’”</p><p>On Monday, a man died after being overcome by debris that swept ashore at Sunset State Beach, about 15 miles southeast of Santa Cruz. Elsewhere in the Monterey Bay region, a man went missing on Monday after being overcome by high surf at Marina State Beach. He was not found before the authorities had to call off search efforts because conditions grew too dangerous, according to the Marina Police Department.</p><p>Storms have caused intense swells in recent years near Santa Cruz and Monterey. Nearly two years ago, waves crashed ashore and flooded beach towns, with energy intense enough to damage a pier at Seacliff State Beach and lead to its demise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>People in advisory areas, especially inexperienced swimmers, were cautioned to stay away from ocean waters throughout California, if possible, said Joe Sirar, a meteorologist at the Weather Service in Oxnard, Calif., which covers Los Angeles.</p><p>“High surf, it will fluctuate,” Mr. Sirar said. “So it kind of looks like normal surf and then suddenly it comes in very high and can sweep people off jetties.” </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a breaking news reporter, based in New York, and a member of the 2023-24 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship class</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/orlando-mayorquin">More about Orlando Mayorquín</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
