But if you survey everybody, I think they’re where they were in November.”</p><p>Democrats, however, are betting that broader momentum is building, as the Trump administration, led by Mr. Musk, moves to gut the federal government, slashing programs and creating chaos that Americans across the political spectrum <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/trump-news-doge-ukraine" title="">are experiencing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/republicans-town-halls.html" title="">feeling personally.</a></p><p>“They are watching how Donald Trump is empowering a billionaire who is unelected to cut their veterans’ services programs, and yet their representatives, these Republican congressional members, aren’t showing up,” said Sarah Godlewski, the Wisconsin secretary of state. “So they’re like, I can make my voice heard in this Supreme Court election.”</p><p>In Wisconsin, the race effectively became a referendum on Mr. Musk, who spent heavily and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">campaigned for</a> the conservative judicial candidate, Brad Schimel, who lost to the liberal candidate, Susan Crawford.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“We didn’t want to go looking for a fight with the richest man in the world, but when the fight comes to you, you don’t back down. That’s also a big lesson,” said Patrick Guarasci, a senior adviser to Ms. Crawford’s campaign. “People need to hear that. There’s so much wilting going on around the country and I think Susan has shown people that you can stand up and fight back and win.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judge Crawford’s election night party in Madison, Wis., on Tuesday night.

And of course, in a political environment in which upheavals seem to come every hour, it is far too early to know what the voter mood on Tuesday will mean for the next round of national elections in which Democrats could reclaim some power: the midterms.</p><p>“It’s indisputably good for Democrats to win special elections, and those results are clear indicators, they’re like the barometric pressure in a midterm environment,” said former Representative Steve Israel of New York, who led the House Democratic campaign arm roughly a decade ago. “They are not necessarily dispositive.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Still, such outcomes can be meaningful for fund-raising and momentum.

We can’t take it for granted.”</p><p>Mr. Anzalone, the pollster, noted that Democrats had become skilled at capitalizing on frustration.</p><p>But that, he said, is no substitution for an affirmative, economic-focused message and other efforts to connect with working-class voters.</p><p>“Anytime that we’ve been winning is because they’ve been losing,” he said. “Republicans screwing up is not a Democratic strategy.”</p><p>Reid J.
