But if you survey everybody, I think they’re where they were in November.”</p><p>Democrats, however, are betting that broader momentum is building, as the Trump administration, led by Mr. Musk, moves to gut the federal government, slashing programs and creating chaos that Americans across the political spectrum <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/trump-news-doge-ukraine" title="">are experiencing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/republicans-town-halls.html" title="">feeling personally.</a></p><p>“They are watching how Donald Trump is empowering a billionaire who is unelected to cut their veterans’ services programs, and yet their representatives, these Republican congressional members, aren’t showing up,” said Sarah Godlewski, the Wisconsin secretary of state. “So they’re like, I can make my voice heard in this Supreme Court election.”</p><p>In Wisconsin, the race effectively became a referendum on Mr. Musk, who spent heavily and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">campaigned for</a> the conservative judicial candidate, Brad Schimel, who lost to the liberal candidate, Susan Crawford.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“We didn’t want to go looking for a fight with the richest man in the world, but when the fight comes to you, you don’t back down.

For Republicans, she went on, “The Trump-Musk agenda is a liability for them. They’re hurting the American people, and people across the country are speaking out.”</p><p>How Mr. Musk may respond and proceed is uncertain. And of course, in a political environment in which upheavals seem to come every hour, it is far too early to know what the voter mood on Tuesday will mean for the next round of national elections in which Democrats could reclaim some power: the midterms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“It’s indisputably good for Democrats to win special elections, and those results are clear indicators, they’re like the barometric pressure in a midterm environment,” said former Representative Steve Israel of New York, who led the House Democratic campaign arm roughly a decade ago. “They are not necessarily dispositive.”</p><p>Still, such outcomes can be meaningful for fund-raising and momentum. And sometimes they are harbingers of<em> </em>where the national environment is headed.</p><p>In 2017, Jon Ossoff, now a Georgia senator, ultimately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/us/politics/karen-handel-georgia-special-election.html" title="">lost</a> what was then the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/20/us/politics/georgia-6th-most-expensive-house-election.html" title="">most expensive House race ever.</a> But he established himself as a powerhouse fund-raiser and his race was an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/us/politics/georgia-special-election.html" title="">early signifier</a> of rising Democratic energy. </p><p>A year later, the Democrat Conor Lamb won a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/politics/democrats-republicans-pennsylvania-special-election.html" title="">stunning upset</a> in a special House election in Pennsylvania, a moment that <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article221221485.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republicans later saw as the beginning of the end</a> of their House majority in 2018.</p><p>“The anxiety and concern on our side is very real, and people are looking for ways to translate that into action,” Mr. Lamb said in an interview this week. “The potential for a strong 2026 is there to be actualized, but it still has to be organized and channeled in the right direction. We can’t take it for granted.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Anzalone, the pollster, noted that Democrats had become skilled at capitalizing on frustration.</p><p>But that, he said, is no substitution for an affirmative, economic-focused message and other efforts to connect with working-class voters.</p><p>“Anytime that we’ve been winning is because they’ve been losing,” he said. “Republicans screwing up is not a Democratic strategy.”</p><p>Reid J.
