<p>Few players have a longer or more storied history with an organization than Derke. The Finnish duelist has been with FNATIC since April 2021 and is the only other current player besides <span data-ref-id="2">

</span> that was on the team during their first international grand finals appearance at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/353/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-reykjav-k" target="_blank">Masters Rekyjavik</a>. Since then, he has qualified for almost every VCT international event and has been a top player at nearly every event he has played in.</p>

<p>FNATIC kept their star-studded roster coming into 2024 following a dominant 2023 season, where they became the first and only back-to-back VCT champions of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a> before placing fourth at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1657/valorant-champions-2023" target="_blank">Champions 2023</a>. </p>

<p>While still a strong team in 2024, they were unable to replicate their previous heights, failing to qualify for Masters Madrid after being eliminated in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1925/champions-tour-2024-emea-kickoff" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> by <span data-ref-id="3">
