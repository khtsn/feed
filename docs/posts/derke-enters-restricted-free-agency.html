</span> has not yet expired and it is possible for him to stay with the team, he is actively seeking other offers for the 2025 season.</p>

<p>&#34;We decided that it&#39;s best to allow Derke to explore his opportunities while we explore what the future of [FNATIC] Valorant can look like,&#34; <a href="https://x.com/CoJoPM/status/1828875641661579621" target="_blank">commented</a> Team Director <span data-ref-id="2">

<p>Few players have a longer or more storied history with an organization than Derke. The Finnish duelist has been with FNATIC since April 2021 and is the only other current player besides <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/438/boaster">
		Boaster	</a>
</span> that was on the team during their first international grand finals appearance at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/353/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-reykjav-k" target="_blank">Masters Rekyjavik</a>. Since then, he has qualified for almost every VCT international event and has been a top player at nearly every event he has played in.</p>

<em>One of the most decorated players the game has to offer.</em></p>

<p>FNATIC kept their star-studded roster coming into 2024 following a dominant 2023 season, where they became the first and only back-to-back VCT champions of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a> before placing fourth at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1657/valorant-champions-2023" target="_blank">Champions 2023</a>. </p>

<p>While still a strong team in 2024, they were unable to replicate their previous heights, failing to qualify for Masters Madrid after being eliminated in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1925/champions-tour-2024-emea-kickoff" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> by <span data-ref-id="4">

			<p>Leo is a great IGL regarding Boaster. He was f.e. calling their crazy win against Heretics, where he also carried statswise (just like against KC).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t believe Boaster will stop this season. He is also a big emotional factor, holding his teams moral up and he&#39;s just a great team mate. I think his value is bigger than many believe.</p>		</div>
