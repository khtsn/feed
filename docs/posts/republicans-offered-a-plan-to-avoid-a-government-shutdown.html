    <h1>Republicans Offered a Plan to Avoid a Government Shutdown</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>House Republicans put forward a new plan this afternoon in an attempt to avert a government shutdown. Their proposal, which would fund the federal government at its current levels through mid-March, was devised after Donald Trump stepped in yesterday to torpedo a spending deal that House Speaker Mike Johnson had struck with Democrats.</p><p>Republican lawmakers said they hoped to vote on the deal this evening. Democrats, whose votes may be needed for the proposal to pass, told reporters they were “united” in voting against it. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/19/us/trump-spending-government-shutdown" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>Crucially, the proposal would suspend the debt ceiling for two years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/business/trump-spending-talks-debt-limit.html" title="">as Trump had demanded</a>. But such a move is “totally anathema to a good chunk of House Republicans,” our congressional correspondent Catie Edmondson told me. And if a spending deal is not approved by Saturday, the government will be forced to shut down.</p><p>Trump, who quickly endorsed the new deal, had publicly turned against Johnson’s initial plan after Elon Musk openly opposed it. Musk made more than 150 social media posts attacking the earlier deal, including threats of political retribution for anyone who voted for it. The deal’s failure was in part <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/politics/elon-musk-politics.html" title="">a display of Musk’s newfound political strength.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Republicans in Congress knew after the election that Trump was going to be a huge influence on them,” Catie told me. Less obvious was the central role that Musk appears to be playing: “That has left some Republican lawmakers wary,” Catie said.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gisèle Pelicot at the courthouse in Avignon, France, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Miguel Medina/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2266c9fa">French rape trial ended with 51 guilty verdicts</h2><p>Dominique Pelicot, who admitted to drugging his wife and inviting dozens of strangers to join him in violating her over nearly a decade, was convicted today of rape and sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison.
