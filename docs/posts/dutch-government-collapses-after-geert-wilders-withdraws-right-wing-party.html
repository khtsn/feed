He said he would stay on as the leader of a caretaker administration, without Mr. Wilders’s party, until elections and the formation of a new government.</p><p>“I think it’s unnecessary and irresponsible,” Mr. Schoof said of Mr. Wilders’ decision.</p><p>It was not immediately clear when new elections would take place, but they appeared unlikely to happen before October, plunging the country into political uncertainty for at least the rest of the year. Mr. Wilders’s party has been dropping in Dutch polls lately.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Wilders announced the withdrawal of his Party for Freedom from the four-party coalition on X, saying it was because of his partners’ refusal to sign off on a new list of proposals to curb migration. “No signature for our migration plans,” he said.</p><p>The political crisis comes as the Netherlands prepares to host a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/europe/nato-summit-trump-ukraine.html" title="">NATO summit</a> on June 24 and 25.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he would resign, but stay on as the leader of the caretaker government.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sem Van Der Wal/Anp, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Wilders’s party — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/world/europe/dutch-election-results-far-right-geert-wilders.html" title="">has advocated</a> banning the Quran, closing Islamic schools and entirely halting the acceptance of asylum seekers — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/world/europe/dutch-election-results-far-right-geert-wilders.html" title="">won the largest number of seats in November 2023</a> elections, sending shock waves through the Dutch political system.</p><p>Mr. Wilders was able <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/world/europe/netherlands-government-wilders-rutte.html" title="">to form a government</a> with three other right-wing parties — the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, a center-right party; the Farmer Citizen Movement, a populist pro-farmer party; and the New Social Contract — after more than six months of wrangling. It was the first government to include Mr. Wilders’s party, which mainstream parties had previously shunned.</p><p>Together, the four parties held 88 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, a comfortable majority. But in a sign of how uncomfortable their arrangement was, the parties agreed not to name any of their own leaders as prime minister. Instead <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/europe/netherlands-prime-minister-dick-schoof.html" title="">they settled on Mr. Schoof</a>, a civil servant with no elective office or party affiliation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It was a marriage of convenience,” said Janka Stoker, a professor of leadership and organizational change at the University of Groningen.</p><p>Despite a decline in further migrant arrivals, anti-immigrant sentiment remains strong across Europe, fueling far-right populism that has brought politicians like Mr. Wilders to power.</p><p>Efforts to limit unauthorized migration have become more mainstream on the continent. In Germany on Monday, a Berlin court ruled that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/germany-asylum-seekers-border-eu.html" title="">German border police can no longer reject asylum seekers</a> who arrive from neighboring European Union countries without investigating their claims, dealing a blow to Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s attempts to control such migration.</p><p>Mr. Wilders had aimed to bring the “strictest migration policy ever” to the Netherlands, something his governing partners had said they agreed with. In May 2024, the four parties reached a deal that included “the strictest asylum admission policy and the most comprehensive migration control package ever.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Wilders, center, in the House of Representatives in The Hague on Tuesday.

Last week he said he wanted to add 10 more proposals to the agreement to further curb migration and demanded immediate support from his governing partners.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The proposals included calls for a complete halt to asylum, a temporary stop to family reunions for asylum seekers who had been granted refugee status and the return of all Syrians who had applied for asylum or were in the Netherlands on temporary visas.</p><p>The leaders of the other coalition parties said that while they did not oppose Mr. Wilders’s plans, they wanted him to propose them in the House of Representatives. That would have taken longer and would not have guaranteed implementation.</p><p>On Tuesday, after an emergency meeting with his coalition partners that lasted barely 20 minutes, Mr. Wilders said he had no choice but to withdraw his party.</p><p>Dilan Yesilgoz-Zegerius, the leader of the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, expressed disbelief. “I am baffled, and I assume his voters are, too,” she said. “I don’t think we will get another right-wing majority.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Caroline van der Plas and Nicolien van Vroonhoven, the leaders of the other two governing parties, called Mr. Wilders’s decision “irresponsible.”</p><p>“He isn’t putting the Netherlands first, he’s putting Geert Wilders first,” said Ms. van der Plas, the leader of the pro-farmer party. “And I blame him for that.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
