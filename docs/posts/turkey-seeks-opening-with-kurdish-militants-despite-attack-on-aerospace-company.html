But it was one of several recent gestures suggesting a new openness in the Turkish government to the possibility of revived peace talks.</p><p>Then on Wednesday, the government blamed the P.K.K. for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/middleeast/turkey-attack.html" title="">a deadly attack on a state-run aerospace company</a>. The attack did not appear to derail the positive momentum.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Turkey has been trying to stamp out the P.K.K. since its founding as an underground militant organization in 1984. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the years since in P.K.K. guerrilla attacks and the Turkish military’s responses. Turkey and its Western allies consider the group a terrorist organization.</p><p>The Turkish authorities captured Mr. Ocalan in 1999 and sentenced him to life in prison, locking him up on an island in the Sea of Marmara, where he was for many years the only prisoner. The government started peace talks with the P.K.K. in 2012, but negotiations collapsed in 2015, unleashing a new wave of violence that washed away any hopes for a truce.</p><p>That is why this month’s gestures, though small, have drawn such attention.</p><p>Throughout his political career, Mr. Bahceli, 76, has been a staunch Turkish nationalist so opposed to any concessions to the Kurdish minority that he once wielded a noose at campaign rallies to bolster his tough-on-terror image.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Turkish nationalist politician Devlet Bahceli in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cagla Gurdogan/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>His Nationalist Movement Party is now President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s largest coalition partner and has long followed a hard-right line, even refusing to sit next to lawmakers from the main pro-Kurdish party in the parliamentary chamber.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>So when Parliament reconvened at the start of this month, Turks took note when Mr. Bahceli’s lawmakers took their seats next to their pro-Kurdish colleagues. They were even more surprised when Mr. Bahceli, who had often dismissed pro-Kurdish politicians as in cahoots with terrorists, walked over to shake their hands.</p><p>Making the offer to Mr. Ocalan during a speech to his party’s members on Monday, Mr. Bahceli said the prisoner could come to Parliament and “shout that terror is completely finished and the group is abolished,” referring to the P.K.K.</p><p>If he did that, Mr. Bahceli said, a legal pathway could open to end Mr. Ocalan’s incarceration.</p><p>The next day, Mr. Erdogan also called for peace, saying he hoped that the “window of opportunity” the governing coalition had opened would not be wasted.</p><p>“We want to build a Turkey with no terror and violence all together,” he said.</p><p>Then, before the attack on Wednesday, the government allowed Mr. Ocalan’s nephew to visit the jailed leader, his first visit from anyone outside the prison in more than three years.</p><p>The nephew, Omer Ocalan, who is also a Parliament member, <a href="https://x.com/omerrocalan/status/1849342534381720042" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared a message from his uncle on social media</a> after the visit. The message had a seemingly conciliatory tone, indicating his uncle’s interest in peace talks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Isolation is ongoing,” it said, referring to Mr. Ocalan’s inability to communicate with anyone outside the prison. “If conditions develop, I have the theoretical and practical power to pull this process from the grounds of conflict and violence to the grounds of law and politics.”</p><p>Of course, wanting peace is much easier than hammering out the terms to end a long, bitter conflict. And the threat of continued violence was made clear by the attack on the aerospace company, which killed five people, just hours after the prison visit.</p><p>The two attackers who carried it out, a man and a woman, were also killed. The government said they were P.K.K. members.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourners, including some politicians, attending the funeral on Thursday of those killed in the attack on the state-run Turkish Aviation Company facility.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Serdar Ozsoy/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>But the attack has not deterred the government, Mehmet Ali Kulat, a pollster based in the capital, Ankara, said in an interview. Turkish officials had been working on new ways to address the P.K.K. issue for a few months and were prepared for such setbacks.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Although this attack showed that the process should be handled more carefully, I believe it will not have an entirely negative effect,” he said.</p><p>Tuncer Bakirhan, the co-chair of Turkey’s main pro-Kurdish party, said in an interview that despite the recent gestures, the government had not reached out to discuss the possibility of new talks.</p><p>His party was interested in talking, he said, but many details needed to be worked out.</p><p>Turkey would need to allow Mr. Ocalan to communicate with the P.K.K. and his other followers, he said, as well as defining what it would offer the P.K.K. in exchange for disarmament.</p><p>“Why should the organization lay down its arms? What steps would Turkey take for those arms to be laid down?” he said. “Those questions are out there and still unanswered.”</p><p>Despite their gestures, Turkey’s leaders have not publicly called for peace talks or expressed any willingness to negotiate or grant concessions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Some Turkish analysts have speculated that the government’s recent moves could be a maneuver by Mr. Erdogan to win Kurdish support for a constitutional change that would allow him to run for president again when his current, third term ends in 2028.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey greeting members of Parliament from his party this month in Ankara, the capital.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cagla Gurdogan/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Other regional and domestic dynamics are also encouraging the government to take a new look at its conflict with the P.K.K., said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara office director of the <a href="https://www.gmfus.org/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">German Marshall Fund</a>, a research group.</p><p>Conflicts elsewhere in the Middle East have encouraged Turkey’s leaders to try to ensure stability at home, he said. And there is speculation that the United States could withdraw its forces from northeastern Syria, leaving the American allied P.K.K. affiliate there vulnerable.</p><p>Turkey’s military has also seriously degraded the P.K.K.’s military capabilities, potentially making the group more open to negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Kurdish political activists in Turkey over the years have put forward many demands, including outright separatism, autonomy within a federal system inside Turkey and greater freedoms to express Kurdish culture and use the Kurdish language.</p><p>Some of those goals may be more achievable now than they were in the past, Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.</p><p>“If they focus on cultural rights, they might be able to get somewhere,” he said. “But if the Kurdish political movement starts with federalism, that is a deal breaker.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Alone in the Dark: </strong>In Bangladesh’s secret underground prison, political captives were pushed to the brink of insanity and death. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/asia/bangladesh-disappeared.html">Some are telling their stories</a> now that the woman who put them there, Sheikh Hasina, is gone.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Panda Factories: </strong>In the 1990s, China began sending pandas to foreign zoos to be bred, in the hope that future generations could be released into nature. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/15/world/asia/pandas-zoo-breeding-death-captivity.html">It hasn’t gone as planned</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving Democracy or Hurting It?: </strong>Brazil’s Supreme Court expanded its power to protect democracy in the country.
