Now, Israeli legislators have laid the groundwork to ban the agency with the passage of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/middleeast/israel-unrwa-ban-gaza.html" title="">two bills</a> set to take effect this month.</p><p>If Israeli authorities enforce the new laws, U.N. officials are warning that no other group will be able to replace UNRWA and that its crucial humanitarian operations in Gaza will grind to a halt at a moment when experts say <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-report-starvation.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">famine is threatening</a> parts of the territory.</p><p>U.N. officials say they are preparing to shutter UNRWA operations in both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It would be a massive impact on an already catastrophic situation,” said Jamie McGoldrick, who oversaw the U.N. humanitarian operation across Gaza and the West Bank until April. “If that is what the Israeli intention is — to remove any ability for us to save lives — you have to question what is the thinking and what is the end goal?”</p><p>UNRWA, the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/magazine/unrwa-gaza-war.html" title="">stands apart</a> from other agencies in the international body. Its 30,000 employees — mostly Palestinians — operate schools, medical clinics, job-training centers, food banks and even garbage collection for six million Palestinians across Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank.</p><p>Since the start of the war in Gaza, UNRWA has transformed itself into an anchor of the international aid response. With 5,000 workers still on the ground, it oversees aid deliveries, runs shelters and medical clinics and distributes food assistance. It clears trash and human waste and provides the fuel that powers hospitals, water wells and nearly every other aid organization in Gaza.</p><p>“The world has abandoned us. We have nothing but the aid we get from UNRWA to survive,” said Sami Abu Darweesh, 30, who lives in a refugee camp in southern Gaza run by UNRWA. “If that stops, what will we do?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Palestinians at a U.N. school in Deir al Balah, in central Gaza, in September.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Saber/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Israel and UNRWA have had a tense relationship for decades. It ruptured last year when Israel accused 18 of the agency’s employees of taking part in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. Israel has also claimed that Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/hamas-unrwa-schools.html" title="">uses UNRWA schools</a> to hide fighters.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A U.N. investigation found that nine employees may have been involved in the attack on Israel and the agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/middleeast/unrwa-oct-7-attack.html" title="">fired them</a>. U.N. officials <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/unrwa-claims-versus-facts-february-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reject most of Israel’s accusations</a> and say the government has refused to share much evidence.</p><p>A recent New York Times analysis of Hamas records showed that at least 24 members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a smaller Palestinian militant group, worked at UNRWA schools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In late October, the Israeli Parliament voted overwhelmingly for legislation to ban UNRWA activity on Israeli soil. The ban is set to go into effect this month, 90 days after the measures were passed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>There are a number of uncertainties surrounding what exactly will happen next.</p><p>The legislation does not directly address the agency’s operations in Gaza or the West Bank, and the Israeli government has been vague about how, or whether, it plans to enforce the new laws there.</p><p>Sharren Haskel, Israel’s deputy foreign minister, declined to clarify the government’s approach to UNRWA in the territories when she spoke to reporters in late December. She suggested only that Palestinian officials should deal with UNRWA in the West Bank, while accusing the agency of harboring terrorists in Gaza.</p><p>U.N. officials have said they are preparing to close down operations in both territories largely because the laws would prohibit Israeli officials from interacting with UNRWA. The agency says it must coordinate with Israel’s military every time its workers deliver aid or move across Gaza and parts of the West Bank.</p><p>“If we can’t share that information with Israeli authorities on a daily basis,” said Louise Wateridge, a senior UNRWA official on the ground in Gaza, “then we have staff lives in danger.” She said more than 250 UNRWA workers had already been killed in the Gaza war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourners praying in October beside the bodies of UNRWA workers killed in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Israeli lawmakers behind the legislation have suggested that they hope it will <a href="https://main.knesset.gov.il/activity/plenum/pages/sessionitem.aspx?itemid=2221412" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">effectively banish</a> the agency from Gaza and the West Bank. Some have said that the 90-day deadline for the laws to take effect was intended to give time for other aid groups to take UNRWA’s place.</p><p>“We gave the government 90 days, and, actually, the entire world 90 days,” said Yuli Edelstein, the chairman of the parliamentary committee that drafted the UNRWA bills. “Whoever truly cares about the population, let them bring about the groups that would help.”</p><p>Israel is already moving away from cooperating with UNRWA, agency officials say.</p><p>Officials at the agency said the Israeli military had prevented UNRWA from using crossings between Israel and northern Gaza, an area where Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-north-gaza-hamas-war.html" title="">mounted intense assaults</a> in recent months.</p><p>At the same time, UNRWA’s aid deliveries have been repeatedly looted in southern Gaza, prompting the agency to <a href="https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1863161719721263406" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">halt deliveries</a> at one key southern border crossing since the beginning of December.</p><p>That has deepened Gazans’ desperation, Ms. Wateridge said.</p><p>Enas al-Hila, 31, said she and her three children fled their home in central Gaza earlier in the war and now live in a tent in a camp managed by UNRWA. She said the agency had been providing food, dried milk and diapers for her children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Even those basic supplies have recently become rare, forcing her to wait in long lines to buy them from resellers for several times the normal price.</p><p>“UNRWA has always been our only hope for jobs, food, flour,” she said. “It’s the lifeline for us and our children, just as it was for our parents and grandparents.”</p><p>The United Nations established UNRWA in 1949 to aid the approximately 750,000 Palestinians who were made refugees in the war surrounding Israel’s founding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/podcasts/the-daily/israel-palestine-1948.html" title="">in 1948</a>.</p><p>Many Israelis view the agency as perpetuating conflict because generations of Palestinians have been allowed to inherit refugee status.
