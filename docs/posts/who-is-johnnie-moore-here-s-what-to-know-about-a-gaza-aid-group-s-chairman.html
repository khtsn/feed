Speaking to The Washington Post in 2018, Mr. Moore said he had advised White House officials that “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/01/08/walking-a-line-the-shrewd-tactics-of-the-white-houses-evangelical-gatekeeper/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">those who bless Israel will be blessed</a>.”</p><p>Mr. Moore cheered Mr. Huckabee’s nomination, <a href="https://x.com/JohnnieM/status/1856424689146511652" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying on social media</a> in November that “selecting a lifelong non-Jewish Zionist as the U.S. ambassador to Israel sends a powerful message to friend and foe of America.”</p><p>Mr. Huckabee, 69, and Mr. Moore, 41, have walked similar paths as public figures and Christian media creators, and they have been <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-06-03/ty-article/.premium/evangelical-leader-close-to-trump-netanyahu-named-new-director-of-gaza-aid-fund/00000197-36b9-dd58-add7-37fb0d5f0000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described as friends in Israeli news media</a>. The embassy did not respond to a request for comment on their relationship.</p><h2 id="link-2cd5af8b">The new face of a troubled Gaza organization</h2><p>Israel imposed a blockade on supplies entering the Gaza Strip in March, accusing Hamas of looting humanitarian aid. That embargo was lifted to a limited degree last month, after the international community raised alarms about widespread hunger in the enclave.</p><p>Israelis conceived of the new system to establish aid distribution sites run by American security contractors in the enclave. It was meant, officials said, to circumvent Hamas, which Israel accused of stealing assistance meant for civilians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But the rollout of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s operation has been chaotic. Its previous head <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/asia/gaza-aid-wood-independence-resigns.html" title="">resigned hours before the initiative</a> was set to begin late last month, citing a lack of autonomy. On Tuesday, Boston Consulting Group, a U.S. advisory firm, said that it had stepped back from its involvement with the organization, that it had placed a partner who had worked on the project on leave and that it would conduct an internal review of its work.</p><p>Humanitarian organizations have criticized the foundation’s approach to aid distribution for a lack of independence from Israel, whose soldiers are positioned near the sites and have fired what the Israeli military has called “warning” shots on multiple occasions. And the United Nations has refused to have anything to do with the effort because it says Israel is militarizing and politicizing humanitarian assistance and putting Palestinians in danger.</p><p>As reports of disarray at aid distribution sites emerged during the project’s first week, Mr. Moore said the <a href="https://x.com/JohnnieM/status/1929237597752062355" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">effort was “working” and should be “celebrated.”</a></p><p>When the Gazan health authorities reported shooting deaths near one of the foundation’s sites, <a href="https://x.com/JohnnieM/status/1929606731933364234" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Moore reposted a statement</a> from Mr. Huckabee accusing the news media and Hamas of spreading misinformation.</p><p>Mr. Moore lists 18 years of service with World Help, a Christian humanitarian organization, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnie-moore-3627091a/details/volunteering-experiences/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">among his volunteer experiences</a>, along with his new appointment at the Gaza foundation and his roles on various advisory boards, including that of the nonpartisan advocacy group <a href="https://www.muslimcoalitionforamerica.org/board-of-advisors" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Muslim Coalition for America</a> and Haifa University in Israel.</p><p>In a statement about his appointment, Mr. Moore said he would help “ensure the humanitarian aid community and the broader international community understand what’s taking place on the ground.” The foundation declined a request for an interview.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter, based in Washington.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
