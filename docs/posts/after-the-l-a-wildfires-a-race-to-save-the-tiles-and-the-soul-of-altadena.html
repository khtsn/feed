In 1910, <a href="https://pasadenahistory.org/batchelder-part-1/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ernest A. Batchelder</a>, an entrepreneur and pioneer of the movement, began firing tiles in his home kiln in Pasadena, which borders Altadena to the south. The tiles were often used to embellish fireplaces, which Mr. Batchelder viewed as the “center of the home.” A majority of the tiles being salvaged are Batchelder tiles, Mr. Garland said.</p><p>“He was a genius, he was an artist, he was a public servant and he embodied the best of the California spirit,” said Rusty Areias, a former California state legislator who has installed Batchelder tiles throughout his home in Sacramento County. Mr. Areias, who is not involved in the salvage effort in Altadena, added, “When you see that patchwork quilt of colors, you just go, ‘Wow.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the tiles are salvaged, they are either returned to the owners or stored temporarily in a warehouse.

So Mr. Van der Linde called Eric Ramos, who owns an architectural salvage company in Los Angeles, to remove them.</p><p>“When we got there, he started crying,” Mr. Ramos said of Mr. Van der Linde. “At that moment, I realized that I couldn’t charge him anything.”</p><p>In the weeks since, Mr. Ramos and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pasadena/comments/1hypih3/free_restoration_of_batchelder_tile_by_local/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other salvage experts</a> have removed the tiles from more than 70 fireplaces in Altadena, Mr. Garland said. He believes there are several dozen more to go.</p><p>The work is physically demanding. Though his back and hands ache, Mr. Ramos, who has continued to offer his services free, is racing to remove tiles from as many fireplaces as possible before cleanup crews bulldoze them. Each tile, Mr. Ramos said, can be worth anywhere from about $20 to thousands of dollars, depending on its origin and design.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“All that’s left are the fireplaces,” Mr. Ramos said. “I just felt like I had a calling.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Masons have removed the tiles from more than 50 fireplaces in Altadena, said Eric Garland, who is helping to lead the salvaging effort, known as Save the Tiles.

Volunteers are working to match those fireplaces with the property owners, so they can contact them to offer to remove the tiles. They have written dozens of letters, sent text messages and emails, and made phone calls, Mr. Garland said, but they are struggling to find them all.</p><p>“We are trying to reach more homeowners every day,” he said, “but we are more urgently trying to beat those bulldozers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tiles being returned to Bonnie Bontempo, whose house burned in the Eaton fire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ryan Young for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>After the tiles are salvaged, they are either returned to the owners or stored temporarily in warehouse space arranged by a donor who is assisting the group, Mr. Garland said.

In some cases, the heat of the fire loosened mortar or burned off residue from tiles that were later salvaged, she said. Anytime she and her team glue a broken tile back together, they do so in a way that it can be disassembled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The goal is conservation, not restoration, Ms. Green said.</p><p>“We’re never disguising the age of something, or hiding the patina of age,” she said. “We are stabilizing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-22"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="00xp-altadenatiles-restoration-zzzzz"><div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>Conservationists preserving damaged tiles from the Altadena Wildfire at Silverlake Conservation in Los Angeles, Calif.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The effort to salvage the tiles is a small part of a broader undertaking to rebuild in a way that honors the region’s architectural heritage, said Adrian Scott Fine, the president of the Los Angeles Conservancy.</p><p>“Altadena had a very rich, distinctive, unique sense of place,” Mr. Fine said. “How do you rebuild in a way that meets modern-day codes but still is representative of the look and feel, and the materiality and the scale, of what was there before?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Homeowners in Altadena have been flooded with all-cash offers for their land.

Dozens of burned properties have been listed for sale, and homeowners have been flooded with all-cash offers for their land.
