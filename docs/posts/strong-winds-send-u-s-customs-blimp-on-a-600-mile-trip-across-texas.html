Maximum wind gusts were around 30 miles per hour that day, slightly stronger than normal, said Ben Ellzey, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Brownsville.</p><p>Operators lost contact with the white blimp shortly after it became loose, according to the statement. The agency asked residents to report any sighting of it.</p><p>According to the Air and Marine Operations division, Quinlan Texas Fire and Rescue found the blimp on Tuesday in Hunt County, about 30 miles east of Dallas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Chief Ryan Biggers of the South Hunt County Fire Rescue said he was puzzled when the department received a “weird” call about 6:40 a.m. Wednesday from Border Patrol seeking help with recovering the blimp. “I was kind of unsure what they meant,” Chief Biggers said.</p><p>When he responded, he saw white material hanging over trees and power lines, as if a white tarp had been laid out, he said. “I couldn’t even tell it was a blimp,” Chief Biggers said.</p><p>The balloon was too tangled for fire equipment, he said, adding that a heavy rotator wrecker was needed to lift the debris and what remained of the blimp off the power lines it had crashed into.</p><p>Jake Cunningham, operations manager at Benson Bros. Wrecker Service, a professional towing company that was called in for assistance with recovering the blimp, said, “Fortunately, we are a little more experienced in some of the stranger calls.”</p><p>Mr. Cunningham said that two operators had extracted the balloon using a 60-ton rotator, a crane with a long arm that spins, in a process that took about two hours. “It was a delicate situation,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Chief Biggers, reflecting on the event, said, “I never received a call like that, and I doubt I ever will again.”</p><p>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to offer additional comment. More details will be shared as they become available, the agency said.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2024-Apr/FY22%20AMO%20One%20Pager.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">air and marine operations branch</a> of Customs and Border Protection, which is responsible for stopping the illegal movement of people and cargo approaching the country’s borders, employs about 1,800 agents and other support personnel and has 240 aircraft and 300 marine vessels.</p><p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection uses aerostat systems, also called blimps, to provide aerial surveillance at the border. The blimps are attached to the ground and can hover as high as 15,000 feet<strong>,</strong> with a search area of approximately 200 feet, according to the agency. They can weigh as much as 2,400 pounds.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
