Last June, the agency sued Amazon, accusing the company of tricking its customers into signing up for its Prime service and then making it difficult to cancel. Amazon has denied the claims.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden’s initiative also applies to gym memberships.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-3ba9c6ba">Real people on customer service lines.</h2><p>When a robotic voice begins its long prompt of menu options on a customer service line, a human could be just one click away under a potential new rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The C.F.P.B. and other federal agencies are targeting what they call “doom loops,” or the many steps customers often have to go through in order to reach a customer service agent. Under the new guidelines, consumers would need to be able to speak to a real person by pressing one button.</p><p>The C.F.P.B holds sway over large banks, credit unions and other lenders.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission is considering similar requirements for phone, broadband and cable companies, according to the White House statement. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor called on health providers to do the same, but haven’t proposed new regulations thus far.</p><h2 id="link-7f0d01c1">Automatic refunds for major flight delays.</h2><p>This spring, the Transportation Department announced that airlines would be required to automatically refund passengers when their flights are canceled, significantly delayed or disrupted.</p><p>Passengers booked on domestic flights delayed by three hours and international flights delayed by six hours would qualify for compensation. Other travel disruptions are also covered, including delays at baggage claim or being downgraded to a lower service class. Extra fees for checking bags and seat selection must also be displayed up front to passengers.</p></div></div><div><p>The refunds must be paid back within one to three weeks. The timing of compensation depends on the type of payment customers used when purchasing the flight or any extra services.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Flight delays in Atlanta in July 2024.

It also prohibits providing compensation in exchange for consumers’ positive reviews.</p><p>The rule also prohibits businesses from suppressing negative reviews and buying fake social media followers or views.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-67d03c5a">The changes may not be immediate.</h2><p>The policies included in the White House initiative are at different places in the rule-making process. Some were introduced a year ago, while others have yet to be officially proposed.</p><p>The process for finalizing rules can take federal agencies anywhere from one to three years, depending on how complicated a policy may be or if there is strong opposition. But a few of these processes have been in the works for some time, including the F.T.C.’s “click to cancel” provision, which was proposed over a year ago.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
