Boasberg, the detailed information he had requested about the deportations, asking the federal appeals court that sits over him to intervene and put the case on hold.</p><p>Taken together, the twin moves — made in separate sets of court papers filed late on Monday — marked a continuation of the Trump administration’s aggressive attempts to push back against Judge Boasberg, the chief judge of the Federal District Court in Washington, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/trump-alien-enemies-act-deportations-venezuelans.html" title="">temporarily halted</a> one of President Trump’s signature deportation policies.</p><p>The Justice Department has now effectively opened up two fronts in the battle: one challenging the underlying orders that paused, for now, the deportation flights and another seeking to avoid disclosing any information about the flights that could indicate they took place after the judge’s orders stopping them were imposed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump attacked Judge Boasberg in a social media post on Tuesday morning, albeit without naming him, as “a troublemaker and agitator,” and called for his impeachment. Mr. Trump’s remarks came days after he declared during a speech at the Justice Department that criticizing judges should be illegal.</p><p>The late night filings and Mr. Trump’s verbal assault followed a day of extraordinary tension between the Trump administration and Judge Boasberg, both inside and outside the courtroom.</p><p>At a hearing in Washington on Monday, a Justice Department lawyer tested the judge’s authority and patience by flatly refusing to provide any details about the timing of the flights that removed dozens of suspected members of the Tren de Aragua gang from the United States to El Salvador.</p><p>Citing “national security” concerns, the lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, said the only thing he could give Judge Boasberg was his assurance that the flights had occurred before a written version of his directive stopping them was formally entered onto the docket.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In an even bolder move on Monday afternoon, the Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to remove Judge Boasberg from the case, citing the “highly unusual and improper procedures” he has used. That effort was preceded by another act of defiance as the administration sought to have the court hearing canceled altogether less than two hours before it was supposed to begin.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judge James E.

Judge Boasberg then issued a second, more expansive order, saying that no suspected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/americas/tren-de-aragua-gang-venezuela.html" title="">Tren de Aragua</a> members could be expelled under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.</p><p>In seeking to dissolve the orders, Justice Department lawyers argued that Judge Boasberg had no authority to issue them in the first place because “the presidential actions they challenge are not subject to judicial review.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The lawyers also claimed that Mr. Trump’s decision to deport the suspected members of the gang — which was recently designated as a foreign terrorist organization — was lawful under the Alien Enemies Act. The statute allows the government during an invasion or a time of war to round up and summarily remove any “subjects of the hostile nation or government” who are over the age of 14 from the United States as “alien enemies.”</p><p>The administration has repeatedly claimed that the suspected gang members should be considered subjects of a hostile nation because they are closely aligned with the Venezuelan government and the leadership of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. The White House has also insisted that the arrival to the United States of dozens of Tren de Aragua members constitutes an invasion.</p><p>But all of those claims are likely to face tough scrutiny as the case moves forward.</p><p>Lawyers for the deported Venezuelans are scheduled to submit a filing to the appeals court on Tuesday evening, challenging the government’s request to put the case on hold. The lawyers will also soon have a chance to make their case directly to Judge Boasberg, reaffirming why they believe Mr. Trump’s deportation plans did not comply with the Alien Enemies Act.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
