Boasberg, off the deportation case and then filed court papers declaring he had no authority to stop flights of immigrants from leaving the country under the law, known as the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>On Tuesday, Representative Brandon Gill, Republican of Texas, filed articles of impeachment against the judge, accusing him of having abused his power. That same day, Mr. Trump himself endorsed the idea of impeachment, calling Judge Boasberg, a centrist Democrat who lived with Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh while they were at Yale Law School, a “Radical Left Lunatic.”</p><p>All of this — and more — prompted a rare public rebuke by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon essentially telling Judge Boasberg’s critics to knock it off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“For more than two centuries,” the chief justice said, “it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”</p><p>“The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,” he added.</p><p>From the moment Judge Boasberg, 62, issued his ruling pausing Mr. Trump’s summary deportation flights on Saturday, the case has emerged as a flashpoint in a larger debate over presidential power, the use of wartime authorities to skirt normal immigration practice and the role of the courts in reviewing the actions of the executive branch.</p><p>It was also the latest — and perhaps most serious — struggle yet between federal judges across the country who have sought to curb many of Mr. Trump’s recent executive actions, and an administration that has repeatedly come close to openly refusing to comply with judicial orders.</p><p>Still, the actual order that has so enraged Republicans in this case was not a permanent injunction, but a provisional decision reached at a Zoom hearing so hastily convened that Judge Boasberg did not even have time to put on a suit or robe. And the judge could end up revising his decision when lawyers for the Justice Department and for five people accused of being members in the gang, Tren de Aragua, meet on Friday for a more substantive discussion of the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>For now, however, the attacks have continued as Fox News hosts, Attorney General Pam Bondi and an angry chorus of Mr. Trump’s supporters online have gone after Judge Boasberg, calling him a hack, a rogue and a terrorist sympathizer, among other things.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judge James E. Boasberg in his chambers at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in Washington in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But while the noise surrounding him has been relentless, Judge Boasberg has largely remained calm in court even as the Justice Department has undertaken two separate legal efforts pushing back at him.</p><p>One is a direct challenge to his order temporarily pausing the deportation flights. The other is an attempt to avoid disclosing any detailed data about the two flights this weekend to El Salvador — information that could indicate whether they took place after the order stopping them had already been imposed.</p><p>The first attack began on Monday night when Justice Department lawyers filed court papers demanding that Judge Boasberg dissolve his order barring the deportation flights. The papers claimed that he had no authority to have issued the ruling in the first place because “the presidential actions they challenge are not subject to judicial review.”</p><p>Department lawyers have also claimed that Mr. Trump’s decision to deport the people suspected of membership in Tren de Aragua — which was recently designated as a terrorist organization — was lawful under the Alien Enemies Act. The statute, which was passed in 1798, allows the government during an invasion or a time of war to round up and summarily remove any “subjects of the hostile nation or government” who are over the age of 14 as “alien enemies.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The administration has repeatedly claimed that those accused of gang membership should be considered subjects of a hostile nation because they are closely aligned with the Venezuelan government and the leadership of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. The White House has also insisted that the arrival to the United States of dozens of Tren de Aragua members constitutes an invasion.</p><p>But many of those claims are likely to face tough scrutiny as the case moves forward.</p><p>In a parallel move, the Justice Department has also repeatedly thrown sand in Judge Boasberg’s efforts to determine precisely when the two flights of Venezuelan immigrants left the United States on Saturday.</p><p>In court and in court filings, department lawyers have asserted that both of the flights left before a written version of the judge’s order was formally placed on the docket at 7:25 p.m. on Saturday.</p><p>But the lawyers have refused — time and again — to tell Judge Boasberg exactly when they left. The judge issued a similar oral ruling from the bench at about 6:45 p.m. that day.</p><p>Justice Department lawyers have said that the oral ruling simply holds less weight than the written one — a position that Judge Boasberg has greeted with a measure of skepticism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“That’s a heck of a stretch,” he said in court on Monday of the attempt to differentiate the rulings.</p><p>The Justice Department has also claimed that any detailed flight data should be kept out of the public eye because of “national security” concerns. And yet Judge Boasberg, who once served on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, is deeply versed in handling state secrets.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, he finally seemed to put his foot down, ordering the Justice Department to send him a sealed filing by noon on Wednesday detailing the times the planes took off, left American airspace and ultimately landed.</p><p>A separate legal fight has been quietly simmering about the level of danger presented by the Venezuelan immigrants who were deported by Mr. Trump under the extraordinary powers of the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>Lawyers for some of the men have claimed they are not members of Tren de Aragua at all, but instead were targeted by the gang while living in Venezuela. And recent court filings the government has submitted to Judge Boasberg have provided a murky view of who these migrants might be.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In one recent filing, the Justice Department cited an immigration officer who acknowledged that several of the people suspected of being gang members did not have criminal records in the United States — largely because they had not been in the country very long.</p><p>Others appear to have been arrested while merely in proximity to Tren de Aragua members during law enforcement raids, according to the officer, Robert L. Cerna II, the acting field office director of the deportation arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>Even as the administration noted what little information it had about each deportee, it made the unusual conclusion that it pointed to a risk, not a lack of one.</p><p>“The lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose,” Mr. Cerna wrote. “It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.”</p><p>As the case continues to move through the courts, so too, no doubt will the criticism of Judge Boasberg. And the attacks are likely to take the form of online outrage rather than impeachment, given that Republicans do not appear to have sufficient votes to carry out an impeachment case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon, Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said that only 15 federal judges had ever been impeached in American history and only for professional misconduct like intoxication, tax evasion, bribery or perjury.</p><p>“We have never impeached a judge for the substance of his ruling in a case, much less for the substance of a correct ruling in a case,” Mr. Raskin said. “Erroneous decisions should be appealed and reversed.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
