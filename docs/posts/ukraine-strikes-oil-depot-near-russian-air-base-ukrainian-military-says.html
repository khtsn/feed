It said the depot supplied fuel to the Engels airfield, which it has said is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/world/europe/ukraine-russia-military-bases.html" title="">staging ground</a> for Russia’s long-running attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, and which hosts some of Russia’s long-range nuclear-capable bombers.</p><p>A Russian official wrote on the Telegram messaging app that a “massive” drone attack had <a href="https://t.me/busargin_r/7862" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">targeted Engels</a>. Roman Busargin, the governor of the Saratov region, said that air defenses had intercepted the drones but that <a href="https://t.me/busargin_r/7861" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">falling debris</a> had hit an “industrial facility” and ignited a fire. No one was hurt, Mr. Busargin wrote.</p><p>Kyiv has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/26/world/russia-ukraine-news" title="">repeatedly targeted</a> the base, trying to limit the strikes on Ukraine’s energy system, which have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/europe/ukraine-electricity-winter.html" title="">plunged cities into darkness</a>, battering the Ukrainian grid and forcing officials to scramble for alternative power options.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The latest attack came as Ukrainian forces are pressing what appears to be a renewed offensive in the Kursk region in western Russia. Both sides have reported fierce fighting over the past few days in Kursk, where Ukrainian troops seized about 500 square miles of territory in a surprise cross-border incursion last summer.</p><p>Russia has since regained roughly half of the territory it lost. Analysts have said the renewed offensive appears to be Ukraine’s attempt to regain momentum and project strength before President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration.</p><p>Mr. Trump has vowed to bring the war to a quick end, without saying how. That has spurred concerns his administration might cut off military aid to Ukraine. The Biden administration has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/politics/ukraine-aid-weapons.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">rushing to get additional assistance</a> to Kyiv before Mr. Trump takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.</p><p>On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III is traveling to Germany for a meeting on Thursday with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/us/politics/nato-ukraine-weapons-lloyd-austin.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">coalition of allies</a> he convened to discuss Ukraine’s security needs after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. It will be Mr. Austin’s 25th — and last — meeting with the group, which includes about 50 countries.</p><p>The meeting “will focus on the need to ensure continued delivery of key capabilities including air defense systems, artillery munitions, and armored vehicles,” <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4023546/secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-to-travel-to-ramstein-air-base-to-host/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Pentagon</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When asked by reporters on Wednesday whether there was concern about the future of the coalition once Mr. Trump takes office, Pentagon officials <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4023442/austin-to-convene-ukraine-coalition-group-to-map-countrys-future-defense-needs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> they were confident European allies would carry on the work — regardless of whether the new U.S. administration decreases its support.</p><p>While the scale of the new Kursk offensive remains unclear, military analysts have suggested that it could also be an attempt to force Russia to divert troops away from the front lines of eastern Ukraine, where they have been steadily wearing down Kyiv’s defenses to seize new ground.</p><p>On Monday, Russia’s defense ministry said its forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/europe/kurakhove-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">had captured Kurakhove</a>, a strategic town in eastern Ukraine, after months of heavy fighting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
