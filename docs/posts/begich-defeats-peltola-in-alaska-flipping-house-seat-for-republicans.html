Back then, Republicans split their votes between him and former Gov. Sarah Palin, allowing the Democrat to prevail in Alaska’s unusual ranked-choice voting system. This time, Mr. Begich benefited from a G.O.P. that united behind him.</p><p>Ms. Peltola, the first Alaska Native elected to Congress, staked her campaign on her working-class appeal and presented herself as a solutions-focused pragmatist fighting for the state’s future. She first won the seat in a special election after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/obituaries/don-young-obituary-alaska.html" title="">death in 2022 of Representative Don Young, the longest-serving Republican in the House</a>. Before Ms. Peltola, the last Democrat to represent Alaska in the House was Nick Begich Sr., Mr. Begich’s grandfather.</p><p>During his first run for Congress, the younger Mr. Begich, who once worked for Mr. Young, drew a backlash from Republicans for challenging the congressman in a primary shortly before Mr. Young’s death at the age of 88. Former Young aides called Mr. Begich deceitful and disloyal to their boss and chose to back Ms. Peltola instead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That was not the case this year. The party united behind Mr. Begich after his top Republican rival, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, withdrew from the race after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/peltola-alaska-house-primary-dahlstrom-begich.html" title="">placing behind him in the late-August primary</a>. Ms. Dahlstrom had the backing of both former President Donald J. Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson.</p><p>Mr. Begich has said he wants to decrease federal spending, a touchy subject in Alaska, where the U.S. government employs more than 16,000 people and federal spending pays for almost half the state’s budget.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
