<p>eMIL first <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/125503/liquid-complete-lcq-roster-with-dimasick-and-emil" target="_blank">joined</a> Liquid towards the tail end of 2022. Liquid were feeling the effects of the loss of their previous coach <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/102/sliggy">

</span>, as they had failed to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1014/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-copenhagen" target="_blank">Masters Copenhagen</a>. eMIL would step in for Liquid right before <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1117/champions-tour-emea-last-chance-qualifier/main-event" target="_blank">LCQ</a>, where he would lead Liquid to win the tournament and secure a spot at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1015/valorant-champions-2022" target="_blank">Champions</a>, where they would finish in the top eight.</p>

<p>With a new roster in 2023, Liquid started out slow, being <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/167362/team-liquid-vs-team-secret-champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo-omega-ro16" target="_blank">dominated</a> by <span data-ref-id="3">

</span> in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/213198/fnatic-vs-team-liquid-champions-tour-2023-emea-league-gf" target="_blank">grand finals</a> to hand them their only loss of the year at that point. This result would qualify themselves for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1657/valorant-champions-2023/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions</a>, but their regional success would not transfer to the international stage. Across both tournaments, they only found <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/220443/team-liquid-vs-edward-gaming-champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo-ubqf" target="_blank">one win</a>, placing in the top six at Tokyo and in the bottom four at Champions.</p>

<p>With another new roster in 2024, Liquid would once again show signs of early struggles, as they failed to make it out of the group stage at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1925/champions-tour-2024-emea-kickoff/group-stage" target="_blank">Kickoff</a>. Unlike the previous year, however, their troubles continued throughout the year, as they would only find four wins through both stages of EMEA. With these results, they failed to qualify to any international events throughout the year, a first for the Liquid organization.</p>
