The Russian security service, the F.S.B., also brought a case against two Italian journalists last week. And the Foreign Ministry has said that further cases are under consideration, including against reporters from The Washington Post.</p><p>An F.S.B. statement identified the CNN reporter as Nick Paton Walsh, a British citizen who is a chief international security correspondent. It also named two reporters from Hromadske, an independent Ukrainian news organization: Olesya N. Borovik and Diana V. Butsko.</p><p>None of the three are based in Russia, and there appeared to be no immediate prospect of their detention there. The statement from the F.S.B. said that they would be placed on Russia’s wanted listed.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Russian government’s actions seemed intended mostly to intimidate those reporting on its failure to prevent Ukrainian forces from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html" title="">seizing a large chunk of territory</a> along the border. Ukraine has also long threatened to take action against reporters who file dispatches from Crimea, which Russia occupied in 2014, if they do not first seek a permit from the government in Kyiv.</p><p>Under Russian law, the maximum penalty for illegally crossing the border is four years in prison and a fine of several thousand dollars, according to the F.S.B. statement, which was quoted by the official news agency Tass.</p><p>The statement noted that similar charges had been brought against two Italian journalists from the state RAI network, Simone Traini and Stefania Battistini. The network announced earlier that it was recalling the reporters for safety.</p><p>Although many news organizations reported on the Ukrainian attack from the border area, including The New York Times, Russia seems to be singling out those who went deeper into its territory, filing reports from the environs of Sudzha, a Russian town about six miles (10 kilometers) from the frontier.</p><p>CNN noted in a statement that its reporting team had undertaken activity protected by the Geneva Convention and international law.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Throughout this conflict our team has delivered factual, impartial reporting covering both the Ukrainian and Russian perspectives on the war,” the statement said. “Our team was invited by the Ukrainian government, along with other international journalists, and escorted by the Ukrainian military to view territory it had recently occupied.”</p><p>On Monday, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said that reporters from The Washington Post who had traveled to Sudzha were also under investigation. Two reporters and a photographer working for the paper filed a report from there. Ukrainian forces moved over the border on Aug. 6.</p><p>Ms. Zakharova accused journalists reporting from Kursk after entering from Ukraine of “whitewashing” what she called Ukrainian crimes and “manipulating public opinion and creating the necessary background for the West’s further support of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.” Only reporters accredited to Russia were allowed, she said.</p><p>In early August, three American citizens, including two journalists who had been jailed on espionage charges widely seen as invented, were swapped in a large prisoner exchange involving 16 Westerners traded for eight Russians held in Europe or the United States.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned Stephanie Holmes, the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Moscow, to protest, accusing the American media of taking “provocative actions” by reporting from the Kursk region.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In a statement, the U.S. Embassy noted that American news organizations are independent and make their own decisions on coverage. “The U.S. government plays no role,” it said, adding that it has actively discouraged all American citizens from traveling to Russia.</p><p>The statement also denied Russian assertions that the United States was involved in any aspect of planning or preparing the Ukrainian operation.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neil MacFarquhar has been a Times reporter since 1995, writing about a range of topics from war to politics to the arts, both internationally and in the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-macfarquhar">More about Neil MacFarquhar</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Russia Charges Reporters Who Covered Ukrainian Incursion Over Border Crossing<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
