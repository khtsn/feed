A procession through crowd-lined streets. A brass band playing. And throngs of devoted, tearful admirers paying their respects as the coffin passed.</p><p>It was time to say goodbye to the Prince of Darkness.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ozzy Osbourne, one of the founders of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, received just such a tribute in Birmingham, England — his hometown — ahead of a private family funeral.</p><p>It was the third time this month that fans had descended on the city for an Ozzfest of sorts. On July 5, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/06/arts/music/ozzy-osbourne-black-sabbath.html" title="">flocked here</a> for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/05/arts/music/ozzy-osbourne-black-sabbath-final-show.html" title="">Osbourne’s final concert</a> at a soccer stadium just a few minutes from the singer’s childhood home. Last week, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/arts/music/ozzy-osbourne-birmingham.html" title="">black-clad, tattooed throngs returned</a> after the singer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/arts/music/ozzy-osbourne-dead.html" title="">died at age 76</a>. On Wednesday, they were back for his funeral procession.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/multimedia/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/multimedia/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/multimedia/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Sharon Osbourne and other mourners stand on a street near a black vehicle." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/multimedia/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/multimedia/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/multimedia/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 684w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/multimedia/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv/30cul-ozzy-procession-qgwv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1367w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d005537a-cbf0-50e1-921e-81d641a16f57" decoding="async" width="600" height="899"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sharon Osbourne with her children and other mourners at the Black Sabbath Bridge.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joanna Yee for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Just after 1 p.m., a car carrying Osbourne’s coffin and a purple floral arrangement spelling out “Ozzy,” with a purple floral cross on its roof, traveled along Broad Street, one of Birmingham’s main thoroughfares. It was followed by other vehicles carrying Osbourne’s closest family members, including his wife, Sharon, and Jack and Kelly Osbourne, two of the couple’s three children.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The route led them to the Black Sabbath Bench, a tourist attraction that has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/arts/music/ozzy-osbourne-birmingham.html" title="">a place of pilgrimage</a> since Osbourne’s death.</p><p>When the group arrived at the landmark, the family members got out to look at tributes to their lost patriarch as the massed fans, who stood several rows deep, shouted tributes including “Ozzy forever.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/multimedia/30cul-ozzy-procession-pwlb/30cul-ozzy-procession-pwlb-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A cortege took the singer’s coffin through the streets of his hometown, Birmingham, England.

The family lingered a few minutes more. Then the emotional group drove off as the brass band played.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the hours before the ceremony, fans had gathered opposite the bench, listened to Osbourne’s music and raucously chanted his name. Many had carried homemade tributes to the singer, or toy bats. Almost all of them were wearing black.</p><p>Some had rushed across borders to make it in time. Niclas Sundsborn, 53, a maintenance worker from Sweden, said that after learning about the procession on Tuesday, he and a metal-loving friend had each spent about $1,300 on plane tickets to fly to Britain. Sundsborn said that his own family “probably think I’m mad” for spending that much, but that Osbourne was “an icon.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/ozzy-tributes-15508-cover/ozzy-tributes-15508-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/30/ozzy-tributes-15508-cover/ozzy-tributes-15508-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/07/30/145524_1_ozzy-tributes-15508_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Tributes for Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Video by Joanna Yee</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In Britain, mourners typically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/world/europe/queen-elizabeth-funeral-procession-london.html" title="">take to the streets</a> in large numbers only for the death of queens or kings.

There was no procession for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/arts/music/david-bowie-dies-at-69.html" title="">David Bowie’s death</a>, in 2016.</p><p>Holly Tessler, a lecturer in the University of Liverpool’s music department, described the mass public mourning for Osbourne as “unprecedented” for a musician in Britain.</p><p>It’s also rare for Birmingham. Carl Chinn, a historian who has written several books on the city’s history, said that the last time large-scale crowds had gathered there to collectively mourn was in 1914, when people hoped to glimpse the coffin of Joseph Chamberlain, a prominent statesmen and former lord mayor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Chamberlain was the first lawmaker to “steadfastly and proudly” advocate for Birmingham on a national scale, Chinn said, adding that Osbourne and his Black Sabbath bandmates had effectively done the same globally with their music.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Ozzy fan at the front of the line in Birmingham.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joanna Yee for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>That partly explains why Birmingham has taken his death so hard, Chinn said. Osbourne, who grew up in one of the city’s working-class districts and worked in a slaughterhouse before he co-founded Black Sabbath in 1968, was one of the city’s own.</p><p>“This has been an outpouring of Birmingham patriotism,” Chinn said.</p><p>Some in the crowd on Wednesday said they were still processing the reality that Osbourne was gone. Goose Giroud, 37, a pilot who was at the front of the barriers, said that she had met Osbourne just two weeks ago at a Comic Con in Birmingham. At the event, she recalled, the singer had pulled her close and signed her arm — a mark that she had made into a tattoo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A street artist at a Black Sabbath mural in Birmingham.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joanna Yee for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>After the procession, Giroud said, “We all know he didn’t want us to be moping today, so we’re trying not to, but we’re devastated.”</p><p>Seeing the Osbournes so upset was hard, Giroud added, but she said the Ozzy fandom had their back. “Now we need to all go and get a drink in his memory,” she said. “And not just one.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Marshall is a Times reporter covering European culture.
