But on Sunday, that prosecutor, Abdelkrim Grini, said in <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/police-justice/meurtre-dans-une-mosquee-du-gard-le-suspect-s-est-rendu-le-procureur-d-ales-reagit-sur-bfmtv_VN-202504280176.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a TV interview</a> that the killing was being investigated as an “anti-Muslim act” or “an act with Islamophobic connotations.” Other motives are being explored, he added, including “a fascination with death, a desire to kill and a desire to be considered a serial killer.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The suspect fled to Italy before turning himself in on Sunday at a police station in Pistoia, a small town near Florence, Cécile Gensac, the Nîmes prosecutor, <a href="https://x.com/ProcureureNIMES/status/1916846983114879327" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Monday. The suspect was identified as a French national of Bosnian origin, born in 2004, who was previously unknown to the police, but nothing else about him or his views has been made public.</p><p>He has not yet been returned to France, which a prosecutor said could take weeks, or charged with a crime.</p><p>“It’s an Islamophobic crime, it’s an act of terrorism, and today we are afraid,” Aminata Konaté-Boune, a spokesperson for Mr. Cissé’s Soninke ethnic group, said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DfqXFjsh5I" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a news conference</a> with the victim’s family on Tuesday. “Tomorrow, what will happen? Will they come knocking on our doors to kill us? Will there be a hunt for Muslims?”</p><p>The killing happened the day after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/europe/french-school-knife-attack.html" title="">a girl was stabbed to death at a high school in Nantes</a>, allegedly by another student who was fascinated with Hitler.

Instead, he traveled on Sunday to Alès, a nearby town, where he met with the local prosecutor and mayors.</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron of France did not comment on the attack until Sunday. “I extend the support of the nation to his family and to our fellow citizens of the Muslim faith,” he said on social media. “Racism and hatred based on religion will never have a place in France. Freedom of worship is inviolable.”</p><p>Yoro Cissé, the victim’s cousin, told the news agency Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that no member of the government had contacted his family. “We want to feel safe; France is a country we love,” he said. “We want to feel like everybody else.”</p><p>Ten percent of France’s population is Muslim, according to a 2023 study by the <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/6793308?sommaire=6793391" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Statistics Institute</a>.
