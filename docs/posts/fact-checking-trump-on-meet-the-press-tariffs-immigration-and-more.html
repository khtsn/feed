    <h1>Fact-Checking Trump on ‘Meet the Press’: Tariffs, Immigration and More</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump, in his first sit-down broadcast interview since his re-election last month, repeated several false and inaccurate claims on a range of topics that were staples of his 2024 campaign.</p><p>In the interview, which aired on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mr. Trump miscast the effect of tariffs, vastly overstated the number of unauthorized immigrants released under the Biden administration, falsely claimed that crime was at “an all-time high,” misleadingly described military spending under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and exaggerated his own polling, among other specious statements.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown.</p><h2 id="link-178f972c">Trade and the economy</h2><p>Mr. Trump wrongly claimed there was “no inflation” under his first term and that inflation did not begin occurring until a year and a half into the Biden administration. (<a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Annual inflation</a> generally hovered between 1 and 2 percent from 2017 to 2020, and had increased to 4.7 percent in 2021.)</p><p>He exaggerated the United States’ trade deficits with Canada and Mexico as $100 billion and $300 billion, describing the figures as a subsidy. (The <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/ft900.pdf#page=47" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trade deficit</a> in goods and services was $41 billion with Canada and $162 billion with Mexico; a deficit simply means that one country’s consumers are buying more from the other nation, not giving money away.)</p></div></div>
