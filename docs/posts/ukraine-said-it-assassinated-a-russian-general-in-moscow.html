Ukraine claimed responsibility for what appears to be one of the most brazen assassinations since Russia’s full-scale invasion nearly three years ago.</p><p>The general, Igor Kirillov, 54, died along with an aide after an explosive device planted in a scooter was detonated this morning, Russian authorities said. Kirillov was the head of Russia’s radioactive, chemical and biological defense forces. Yesterday, Kyiv had blamed him for the “massive use of banned chemical weapons” in Ukraine.</p><p>While other Russian generals have died during the war, Kirillov is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/world/europe/igor-kirillov-russian-general.html" title="">highest-ranking military official to have been killed inside Russia</a>. Ukraine’s security service shared <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/world/europe/russian-general-assassination-igor-kirillov-video.html" title="">a video of the attack</a>.</p><p>A senior American official said the U.S. was not informed about the assassination ahead of time and warned that the killing might be counterproductive by inciting a reaction from Vladimir Putin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Outside Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wis., this morning. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-41615c22">Madison mourned after a school shooting</h2><p>A makeshift memorial grew on a sidewalk outside <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/wisconsin-school-shooting-madison-residents.html" title="">a Christian school in Madison, Wis.</a>, where a teenage student fatally shot a teacher and a fellow student yesterday. Police identified the shooter as Natalie Rupnow, a 15-year-old student who died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Much is still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/madison-wi-school-shooting-abundant-life.html" title="">unknown about the attack</a>.</p><p>In an update this afternoon, the city’s police chief said it “appears that the motive was a combination of factors” but did not say what the factors were. He said that her parents were cooperating with investigators. Two victims were still hospitalized with life-threatening injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden in Luanda, Angola, this month. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-269d1c53">A weary Biden heads for the exit</h2><p>With about a month left in office, President Biden is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/biden-final-days-in-office.html" title="">determined to shape his legacy as a consequential leader</a>. He recently visited Angola and the Amazon rainforest, gave a 40-minute “legacy speech” in which he claimed credit for a healthy economy and made another push for a cease-fire in Gaza.</p><p>But time is catching up with the president. He looks a little older and appears a little slower each day. And he has absented himself from debates convulsing the country: After warning that Trump posed an existential threat to American democracy, Biden went silent on the matter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk’s security clearance requires him to report certain activities to the Defense Department.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-1db851ce">Elon Musk and SpaceX face national security reviews</h2><p>Elon Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, secured at least $10 billion in federal contracts from 2019 to 2023.
