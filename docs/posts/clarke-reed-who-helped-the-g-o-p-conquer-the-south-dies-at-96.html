He was 96.</p><p>The cause was complications of pneumonia, his family said in a statement.</p><p>Though his parents were both Democrats, Mr. Reed was a lifelong Republican. He got his first chance to vote in a presidential election in 1952, casting his ballot for the Republican candidate, the former Army general Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p><p>Mr. Eisenhower won the race in a landslide, but he still managed to lose the entire Deep South, Mississippi included.</p><p>That was no surprise: The Democrats — as the party of the Confederacy and, later, Jim Crow — had held a tight grip on the region since before the Civil War. In most Southern states, including Mississippi, the Republican Party was nothing more than a mailbox.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Reed set out to change that. Using his Greenville home as a meeting place and his business connections to open doors, he began recruiting candidates, organizing campaigns and pressuring powerful friends to switch parties.</p><p>Building the party was slow going, but Mr. Reed persevered. A licensed pilot, he thought nothing of hopping into his Piper Seneca six-seater for a quick flight to Jackson or Tupelo to meet with a potential candidate or a deep-pocketed supporter.</p><p>He was a thinking man’s power broker, deeply read in the conservative canon — Adam Smith, Edmund Burke — and close with contemporary intellectuals like William F. Buckley Jr. and Milton Friedman.</p><p>Thanks in part to his work, Senator Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican candidate for president, won 87 percent of the Mississippi vote even though he was crushed nationally by President Lyndon B. Johnson. (It helped that Mr. Johnson had recently signed the Civil Rights Act, making him anathema across the Deep South.)</p><p>Mr. Reed became the state party chairman in 1966 and, soon after, the head of the Southern Republican Chairmen’s Association, giving him a strong say over the party’s progress across the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As state chairman, he focused on local elections, and in 1969, Mississippi Republicans won nine mayoral races. In 1972, two of the party’s congressional candidates, the future senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott, were among the first Mississippi Republicans to go to Washington in a century.</p><p>“He was the guy,” the political consultant Karl Rove, who was an acolyte of Mr. Reed, said in a phone interview. “The Republicans in Mississippi, people don’t understand today — they weren’t even a beleaguered minority. They were an asterisk.”</p><p>Mr. Reed became a national figure after the 1968 election, when he rallied support behind Richard M. Nixon, whose “Southern strategy” involved bringing disaffected Southerners into the Republican fold. In return, Mr. Nixon gave him an unofficial veto on policies affecting the South: “Clear it with Clarke” became a standing order in the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Reed became a national figure when he rallied support behind Richard M.

Moderates, rallying around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html" title="">President Gerald R. Ford</a>, wanted a big-tent approach, while conservatives like Mr. Reed saw a path through purism.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The clash came to a head at the 1976 Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Mo., when Mr. Ford faced a conservative insurgency from Ronald Reagan, the former governor of California. While many state delegations had committed to support a candidate beforehand, Mr. Reed kept Mississippi uncommitted to increase its influence.</p><p>He came into the convention convinced that he, and the state delegation, would back Mr. Reagan. But when Mr. Reagan announced that a liberal Republican, Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania, would be his running mate, Mr. Reed switched his allegiance to Mr. Ford, calling the choice of Mr. Schweiker “a hell of a mistake.”</p><p>He let his delegates vote however they chose, and they split: 16 for Mr. Ford and 14 for Mr. Reagan. But Mr. Reed’s influence most likely swayed votes outside the Mississippi delegation, and in the end Mr. Ford edged out Mr. Reagan for the nomination.</p><p>The decision made him enemies at home, for a time, although he quickly made up with Mr. Reagan. Still, he came to regret it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“I should have stayed with him, even after Schweiker,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1976/11/campaigning-i-clarke-reed-of-mississippi/664379/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Reed told The Atlantic soon after</a>. “1 was not with my friends on this one, and you don’t like being out of step, by yourself.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Reed with his wife, Judy, in 2004.

When he was six months old, his family moved to Caruthersville, Mo., in the southeast corner of the state. His father, Lyman, sold grain bins and elevators, and his mother, Kathryn (Reynolds) Reed, managed the home.</p><p>He graduated with a degree in economics from the University of Missouri in 1950, and then spent two years in the Air Force. While he waited to be called up for duty, he worked at a soybean-processing plant in Greenville, Miss., and he returned there after his service ended.</p><p>After he settled in, he and a friend from school, Barthell Joseph, founded a company that provided agricultural equipment to local farmers; they eventually specialized in devices that scared away birds from farms and airfields.</p><p>He married Julia Brooks, known as Judy, in 1957. She survives him, along with their son Clarke Jr.; two granddaughters; and two great-grandchildren. Another son, Reynolds, died in 2019, and their daughter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/dining/julia-reed-dead.html" title="">the writer Julia Reed</a>, died in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Reed stepped down as state party chairman at the end of 1976. But he remained an informal power broker for decades after.</p><p>He often held court at Doe’s Eat Place, a dog-eared diner famous for its <a href="https://www.southernfoodways.org/interview/hot-tamales-the-mississippi-delta/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hot tamales</a> and steak, or at his home, where he entertained a steady flow of politicians, journalists and friends, often at the same time and always with a ready supply of food and bourbon.</p><p>“For him, politics was important, but it wasn’t blood sport,” the historian Jon Meacham, a friend of the family, said by email. “And he was charming about it all.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
