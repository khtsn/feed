    <h1>Both Israel and Hezbollah Have Reasons to Reject a Cease-Fire Deal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Israel doesn’t want a temporary cease-fire solution that doesn’t meet their needs and means that in two years’ time they have to do this all over again,” said Michael Stephens, a Middle East expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research group. “Their thinking is: Why negotiate a 21-day cease-fire for good P.R. when it addresses none of their security concerns that led to this point?”</p><p>Hezbollah has given no indication that Israel’s recent attacks, which have included targeted killings of high-level members of the militia and widespread airstrikes that have killed hundreds of people in Lebanon this week, have changed its position.</p><p>Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s’s secretary general, reiterated the group’s position in a televised speech last Thursday, not long after thousands of pagers blew up in an apparent act of Israel sabotage. He said Hezbollah considers it a religious, moral and humanitarian duty to stop what he called “mass killing” in Gaza.</p><p>To compromise to the extent Israel seeks, Hezbollah might need approval from its benefactor, Iran, analysts said.</p><p>An ambiguous speech this week by Masoud Pezeshkian, the Iranian president, could be interpreted as signaling a potential shift in Iran’s approach, said Paul Salem, a senior analyst at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based research group.</p></div></div>
