Many street vendors are back working, and gangs have also been pushed out of the capital&#39;s main public hospital.</p><p>But the Kenyan officers are vastly outnumbered, and the heavily armed gangs remain firmly entrenched in many parts of Port-au-Prince. Huge swaths remain no-go zones, including downtown and the area around the U.S. Embassy. Gangs no longer control the public hospital, but it is in shambles and has not reopened.</p><p>Criminal groups have also expanded their control outside the capital, seizing three key roads linking Port-au-Prince to other parts of the country and laying siege to smaller cities and towns that the international force does not have the resources to reach.</p><p>Last week, a gang in the Artibonite Valley in the central part of the country attacked a town, leaving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/haiti-gang-attack.html" title="">88 people dead, including 10 gang members.</a></p><p>More than 700,000 people who fled their homes during a wave of violence over the past year and a half are still unable to return.
