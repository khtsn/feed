Many street vendors are back working, and gangs have also been pushed out of the capital&#39;s main public hospital.</p><p>But the Kenyan officers are vastly outnumbered, and the heavily armed gangs remain firmly entrenched in many parts of Port-au-Prince. Huge swaths remain no-go zones, including downtown and the area around the U.S. Embassy. Gangs no longer control the public hospital, but it is in shambles and has not reopened.</p><p>Criminal groups have also expanded their control outside the capital, seizing three key roads linking Port-au-Prince to other parts of the country and laying siege to smaller cities and towns that the international force does not have the resources to reach.</p><p>Last week, a gang in the Artibonite Valley in the central part of the country attacked a town, leaving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/haiti-gang-attack.html" title="">88 people dead, including 10 gang members.</a></p><p>More than 700,000 people who fled their homes during a wave of violence over the past year and a half are still unable to return.

Jamaica and Belize have also sent a small number of officers.</p><p>Reinforcements would allow the Kenyans to set up a dozen forward operating bases throughout the metropolitan area and in the nearby Artibonite Valley so that an area retaken from gangs can be held, Mr. Otunge said.</p><p>When the Kenyans responded in late July to a gang attack in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/world/americas/haiti-gangs-kenya-police.html" title="">Ganthier,</a> about 20 miles east of Port-au-Prince, the operation took a week because of the lack of air support, and officers had to sleep in their vehicles, Mr. Otunge said. There was no food for the Kenyan officers so the Haitian police shared theirs, he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Still, he added proudly, “we pushed the gangs.”</p><p>Recounting the deployment’s early days in Haiti when it was trying to force gangs out of the airport, Mr. Otunge said, “Our officers were being shot at each and every day.’’</p><p>But they pressed on, he added. “We said, ‘We can’t stop.
