If Washington is putting up a higher fence around its trade, other nations are lowering theirs.</p><p>In just the last two months, the European Union concluded three new trade deals.</p><p>The bloc, completing negotiations that started 25 years ago, reached a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/europe/eu-trade-deal-mercosur-latin-america.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">major agreement</a> with four South American countries in December to create one of the world’s largest trade zones, linking markets with 850 million people.</p><p>Two weeks later, the European Union struck a deal with <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/12/20/eu-swiss-single-market-trade-deal-faces-challenging-referendum" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Switzerland</a>.

It also resumed talks, after a 13-year postponement, on a free-trade agreement with <a href="https://www.eureporter.co/world/malaysia/2025/01/22/eu-and-malaysia-relaunch-free-trade-agreement-negotiations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malaysia</a>.</p><p>“With Europe, what you see is what you get,” the European Commission president, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/davos-2025-special-address-by-ursela-von-der-leyen-president-of-the-european-commission/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ursula Von der Leyen</a>, boasted to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We play by the rules. Our deals have no hidden strings attached.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Saturday, Mr. Trump ordered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/trump-tariffs-news" title="">25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada</a> — partners in a trade bloc that he himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/economy/usmca-trump.html" title="">signed</a> in his first term — and 10 percent tariffs on China. Mexico and Canada immediately vowed to retaliate, and China said it would consider “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/trump-tariffs-news" title="">countermeasures</a>.”<strong> </strong>Europe, Mr. Trump promised in recent days, was next: “The European Union has treated us so terribly.”</p><p>Of course, the United States, with the planet’s largest and strongest economy, cannot be ignored. But it can, at least sometimes, be avoided.</p><p>By punishing longtime allies with tariffs, Mr. Trump is encouraging other nations to form trading blocs and networks that exclude the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A freight train in Windsor, Ontario, on Saturday.

This economic club now includes half the world’s population and more than 40 percent of its total economic output. Another eight countries, including Bolivia, Thailand, Kazakhstan and Uganda, are on the path to becoming full partners.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In May, the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, will meet the six Middle Eastern nations that make up the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/gulf-cooperation-council" title="">Gulf Cooperation Council</a>. The summit’s host, Malaysia, has invited China to attend.</p><p>China is also poised to update its own free-trade agreement with ASEAN, which includes Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. And trade and investment between ASEAN and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/business/india-economy-election-takeaways.html" title="">India,</a> the world’s most populous nation, is deepening.</p><p>Britain, too, recently christened a new partnership. In December, it officially joined the <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9121/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trans-Pacific trade bloc</a>, a group that includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

Kirkegaard, a senior fellow in Brussels at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p>The trend is not necessarily anyone’s preference, he said, but the arrangements offer a “second best” option given America’s rejection of a more open economic order. He added that the proliferation of trading blocs, like the one between the European Union and South American nations, also helped countries avoid an overreliance on China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s latest unilateral and protectionist missives have sped up a reel that had already begun to unspool.</p><p>Over the past couple of decades, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/business/economy/global-economy-us-china.html?searchResultPosition=15" title="">backlash</a> against a globalized world of open borders and hands-off government simmered. Factories moved to nations with lower labor costs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/31/world/europe/angry-farmers-are-reshaping-europe.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">farmers</a> faced increased competition, and the 2008 financial crisis threatened to wreck the global financial system.</p><p>In 2016, Britons, unhappy with dictates agreed upon by the 27 other members of the European Union, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/world/europe/britain-brexit-european-union-referendum.html" title="">voted to exit</a>. President Trump during his first term bridled at any institutions and accords — the World Trade Organization, climate treaties and trade partnerships with countries on the Pacific Rim — that could limit his prerogatives.</p><p>At the same time, economic power around the globe was shifting. China had emerged as an economic superpower. Not only does it now account for more than 30 percent of the globe’s manufacturing, but it has also leaped ahead of the rest of the world in cheaply producing sophisticated electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels.</p><p>Regional trade routes and networks among allies grew faster after the Covid-19 pandemic exposed supply chain vulnerabilities, Russia invaded Ukraine, and relations between the United States and China worsened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The biggest changes in trade can be seen in Asia. Nearly 60 percent of Asia’s trade happens within the region, according to a new report from HSBC Global Research. And half of the world’s fastest-growing trade corridors are there. In 2023, China’s exports to ASEAN nations bypassed those from the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yangshan Port in Shanghai.
