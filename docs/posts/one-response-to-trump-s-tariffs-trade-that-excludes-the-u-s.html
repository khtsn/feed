Kirkegaard, a senior fellow in Brussels at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p>The trend is not necessarily anyone’s preference, he said, but the arrangements offer a “second best” option given America’s rejection of a more open economic order.

President Trump during his first term bridled at any institutions and accords — the World Trade Organization, climate treaties and trade partnerships with countries on the Pacific Rim — that could limit his prerogatives.</p><p>At the same time, economic power around the globe was shifting. China had emerged as an economic superpower. Not only does it now account for more than 30 percent of the globe’s manufacturing, but it has also leaped ahead of the rest of the world in cheaply producing sophisticated electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels.</p><p>Regional trade routes and networks among allies grew faster after the Covid-19 pandemic exposed supply chain vulnerabilities, Russia invaded Ukraine, and relations between the United States and China worsened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The biggest changes in trade can be seen in Asia.
