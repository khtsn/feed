                  <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Valve for &#34;illegally promoting gambling through video games popular with children and teenagers.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday after an investigation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) deemed that &#34;Valve’s video games, including Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2, enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value.&#34;</p>
                  <p>James seeks to &#34;permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York&#39;s laws.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The high-profile case is the latest in a growing number of regulatory and legal challenges Valve has faced around its lootboxes. In 2018, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netherlands-gaming-authority-cracks-down-on-loot-boxes-in-some-games/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">opening cases was restricted in the Netherlands</a> after the Dutch Gaming Authority classified paid loot boxes as gambling. The ruling was overturned in 2022, but case openings remain restricted in the Netherlands.</p>
                  <p>In October 2025, the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee also <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20251013IPR30892/new-eu-measures-needed-to-make-online-services-safer-for-minors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">adopted a report</a> that recommends the European Commission ban lootboxes for minors under the age of 16.</p>
                  <p>In September 2025, Valve released the &#34;Genesis Uplink Terminal&#34; in Counter-Strike 2, which allows users to directly purchase a skin offered by an &#34;arms dealer,&#34; marking a move away from the lootbox method.</p>
                  <p>James alleges in the lawsuit that &#34;Valve has made billions of dollars luring its users, many of whom are teenagers or younger, to engage in gambling in the hopes of winning expensive virtual items that they can cash in on.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The investigation also alleges that Valve facilitates the ability for items to be sold on third-party platforms.</p>
                  <p>&#34;Users can also connect their Valve accounts to third-party marketplaces where the virtual items can be sold directly for cash,&#34; the press release says. &#34;The OAG’s investigation found that Valve facilitates and even assists these third-party marketplaces in their operations.&#34;</p>
