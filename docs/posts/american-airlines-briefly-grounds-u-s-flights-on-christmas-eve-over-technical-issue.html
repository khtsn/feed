    <h1>American Airlines Briefly Grounds U.S. Flights on Christmas Eve Over Technical Issue</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ground stop caused by the technical delay lasted only for an hour, but it came on what was expected to be a record period for holiday travel. Tens of millions of people fly during the period from mid-December to shortly after New Year’s Day. The F.A.A. had said it expected more than 31,000 flights on Christmas Eve.</p><p>American is the largest carrier in the United States by number of seats, <a href="https://www.oag.com/blog/biggest-airlines-in-the-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to OAG</a>, an aviation data provider. It has more than 3,300 domestic flights scheduled on Tuesday and 581 international departures, according to Cirium.</p><p>Some passengers took the problem in stride. Mary Hardy, 64, was waiting at Dallas Fort Worth for her flight to Newark when the delay was announced. She said she was disappointed, but acknowledged that mishaps were to be expected during holiday travel.</p><p>“We should have known flying out Christmas Eve that something could happen,” she said. “You just have to be prepared.”</p><p>The disruption also came during a rocky year for the aviation industry. In July, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/microsoft-crowdstrike-outage-what-happened.html" title="">flawed software update</a> issued by the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike led to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/business/microsoft-outage-cause-azure-crowdstrike.html" title="">global technology outage</a>, affecting many businesses, including airlines. At least five U.S. airlines — Allegiant, American, Delta, Spirit and United — grounded all flights for a time, according to the F.A.A.</p><p>In December 2022, bad weather forced several airlines to cancel many flights on Christmas, but Southwest Airlines struggled for much longer than its competitors. It took days for Southwest to restore operations as it grappled with technical and other problems, including an inability to efficiently get crews to where they were needed. The meltdown stranded an estimated two million passengers and cost Southwest more than $1 billion, including lost revenue, refunds and reimbursements.</p><p>Kristen Bayrakdarian<!-- --> contributed reporting from Dallas and <!-- -->Sara Ruberg<!-- --> from New York.</p></div></div>
