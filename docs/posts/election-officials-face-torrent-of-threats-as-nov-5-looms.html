On Tuesday, the police in Tempe, Ariz., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/arizona-dnc-office-shootings-arrest.html" title="">arrested a man</a> in connection with shootings at a Democratic campaign office, which resulted in no injuries, and other acts of political vandalism.</p><p>On Wednesday, prosecutors charged a 61-year-old man from Tampa, Fla., with threatening an election official — on top of <a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Fusao-mdfl%2Fpr%2Ftampa-dentist-charged-sending-threats-death-and-injury-multiple-victims%3Futm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/01000192bb4be7db-b87bf7d3-0200-489c-8601-80bf029cb1c0-000000/qlDOYw-r2-j_jtVSdUIQq_fFMoWft0w5LSxfZjJjIDQ=376" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pending charges</a> over menacing messages sent in the past five years. And on Thursday, police officers in Phoenix arrested a person in connection with a mailbox fire, damaging some 20 ballots in a Democratic stronghold.</p><p>Law enforcement’s task this year goes far beyond the relatively straightforward job of providing physical security — to the essential mission of safeguarding the election from individuals and groups who want to instill fear and uncertainty, even if they never resort to violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Political battlegrounds are taking on the sobering characteristics of actual ones. Drones, barriers and snipers are expected to be deployed at some offices and polling sites. Bulletproof glass and armed security patrols are becoming increasingly commonplace everywhere.</p><p>“The fact that election workers need to be worried about their security is incomprehensible and unacceptable,” Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., said in a statement on Wednesday after the Justice Department released an update on threats to election workers and political activists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Attorney General Merrick B.

Still, the threat level has been manageable thus far. Federal law enforcement officials say that for the moment there are no indications of an organized effort to disrupt the electoral process as in 2021, when supporters of President Donald J. Trump stormed the Capitol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Nonetheless, anxiety is spreading at all levels of government. There have already been two assassination attempts against the former president this year, and officials remain concerned about lone actors as well as potential militia activity, although none has yet been detected.</p><p>“Our polling places have become battlegrounds,” Isaac Cramer, executive director of South Carolina’s Charleston County Board of Voter Registration and Elections, said in congressional testimony this year. He described one particularly unnerving practice being employed against his poll workers — roving groups who show up at voting locations to threaten volunteers and staff with citizen arrests.</p><p>Sara Tindall Ghazal, a member of the Georgia state election board, said officials had faced an array of tactics, including death threats and hoax calls intended to elicit an armed police response.</p><p>The attacks on workers can be painfully personal, she added. Neighbors shout in their faces when they go to church on Sundays. Children answering the door when their parents are not home have been subjected to terrifying harangues.</p><p>“It’s really hard to conceive how we walk back from this,” Ms. Ghazal said.</p><p>In 2021, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland created an elections threat task force based in the department’s public integrity unit to address the growing threats to election security. The effort includes the F.B.I., the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Department of Homeland Security and cybersecurity agencies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The federal government’s legal and logistical reach is limited. Overseeing elections and securing poll sites — within the confines of the Constitution and federal law — has been the responsibility of local authorities from the earliest days of the republic. Local law enforcement, particularly state police and county sheriffs, play a frontline role in investigating many threats, with federal officials taking a lead part in cases that clearly involve national elections.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A polling place in Dallas, Pa., earlier this year.

Several defendants, in fact, expressed astonishment and remorse that their outbursts had grave personal consequences.</p><p>“The thing that really struck me was when I was first arrested, I’m sitting in a jail cell, and I was already under water, you know, my head spinning,” Francis Goltz, 52, said in court this month after pleading guilty in August 2023 to threatening election officials in Arizona.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>”I should have been putting my kids to bed, locking the doors and whatnot,” he added. “I wasn’t there because of the stupidity that I displayed.”</p><p>Over the past year, the Justice Department task force has conducted multiagency tabletop exercises and training sessions for a range of scenarios. They span efforts to disrupt voting on Election Day, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence threats, tampering with mail-in ballots and the targeting of officials and volunteers if the results are contested, as they were four years ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ballots at an elections office in Florida during the primary in March. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zack Wittman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The F.B.I. and task force officials will establish a national command center in Washington and other locations around the country on Nov. 1, the Friday before Election Day, to monitor threats and coordinate any federal response.</p><p>The plan is to close the center a week later but officials believe it will have to remain open much longer, given the likelihood of post-election legal challenges — and threats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Local elections officials and federal law enforcement agencies are just as worried about what will happen if the neck-and-neck battle between Vice President Kamala Harris and Mr. Trump drags into an extended period of legal and political wrangling.</p><p>Some officials and election security experts are anxious about the growing expectation among Trump supporters that his victory is inevitable could spur acts of violence, harassment and intimidation by individual perpetrators or small pop-up cadres.</p><p>“The election denialists are better coordinated and better funded than they have ever been and there could be so much false information,” added Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center, a New York-based nonpartisan policy and legal institute that surveyed election workers this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-finds-concerns-about-safety-political" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The survey</a> found that almost 40 percent had been the target of threats or harassment. One in four expressed fear their families would be targeted — and a third said they knew someone who had given up their job to avoid the hassle and hazard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Election officials processing mail-in ballots in Maricopa County, Ariz., this week. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matt York/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>It has been a challenge to recruit Republican election judges, who became the targets of Trump supporters four years ago, Aaron O. Ammons, the clerk of Champaign County, Illinois, said on a call organized by the Election Center, a national organization of election officials.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The biggest concern for federal law enforcement is that there might be an undetected effort to disrupt the electoral process. The people most prone to acting violently, like the two would-be Trump assassins, do not often explicitly advertise their plans.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security memo last month reported that there was “no indication” of a coordinated plan. But officials also conceded that they lacked “a complete threat picture due to the ability” of some groups “to evade law enforcement using advanced encryption.”</p><p>There are, however, differences between the current environment and the heated atmosphere of the 2020 campaign, which took place amid protests against pandemic restrictions, unrest following the murder of George Floyd, and the conservative backlash against that movement.</p><p>Law enforcement officials believe a bloody mass attack like the one that erupted nearly four years ago at the Capitol is less likely this time around — in part because they have strengthened security protocols and in part because leaders of the two extremist groups that played central roles in the attack, the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, were convicted and sent to prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Prosecutors hope that many would-be perpetrators will be dissuaded from taking action by the cautionary example of key figures who abetted Mr. Trump’s attempts to stay in office. Those include the former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is facing criminal charges and has been disbarred and stripped of his assets following a $150 million judgment for defaming two Georgia election workers.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A polling place in South Carolina, where a state voting official told Congress earlier this year that roving groups would show up at voting locations to threaten volunteers and staff with citizen arrests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Belleme for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>But local governments in battleground states, who face the brunt of attacks and intimidation, are on high alert. They have taken steps to protect their workers from a repeat of the 2020 and 2022 elections, when there was also a heightened level of threats.</p><p>Most of that funding has come from local and state coffers, but in 2023, the Homeland Security Department mandated that states steer tens of millions in federal grants to election security and to prepare for extremist attacks.</p><p>In Cobb County, a vote-rich chunk of suburbia north of Atlanta, managers at all 148 polling places have been given police-style radios with panic buttons that allow for instant contact with law enforcement personnel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Ross Cavitt, a county spokesman, said that officials’ safety concerns stemmed in part from a heated but nonviolent confrontation that a poll worker had in March with a man who was carrying a gun.</p><p>The elections office in Fulton County, the state’s most populous county, was targeted last year by anonymously mailed letters, several of which appeared to have been laced with fentanyl.</p><p>As a result, most elections offices in Georgia’s 159 counties are now stocked with naloxone, the opioid overdose medication, if workers are exposed to the potentially deadly drug.</p><p>“I do remember back in the 1990s, the police department would direct traffic on Election Day,” said W.
