Thousands of Lebanese displaced by the war have poured onto roads leading south, heading back to their homes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But as the original deadline passed on Sunday for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the forces of the militant group Hezbollah from southern Lebanon, a very different scenario was taking shape. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Israeli forces killed at least 22 people and injured 120 in southern Lebanon, making Sunday the deadliest day in the country since the war ended in November.</p><p>The Israeli military said in a statement late on Sunday that it had fired “warning shots in order to eliminate threats” — a formulation that suggested the shots may have been more than just warnings. It said that there had been “dozens of rioters” in the area. The military also said its soldiers had spotted a “a vehicle with Hezbollah flags” and that its forces had “operated in order to remove the threat.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People gathering on Sunday as the army secured an area near the village of Kfar Kila in southern Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karamallah Daher/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In recent days, Israeli officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-withdrawal-deadline.html" title="">expressed concerns</a> that Hezbollah remains active in southern Lebanon and it has doubts about the Lebanese Army’s ability to rein in the group.</p><p>Those claims could not be independently verified. The five-member committee overseeing the implementation of the cease-fire has not publicly released any information regarding Hezbollah’s compliance with the terms of the truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The White House statement on Sunday made no specific mention of Hezbollah or of Israel’s military presence in southern Lebanon. It did say that the governments of Lebanon, Israel, and the United States would begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 that prompted the regional war.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Israel, the Lebanese government or Hezbollah.</p><p>United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, warned in a statement on Sunday that it was “imperative to avoid further deterioration of the situation.” It called on the Israeli military to avoid firing at civilians, and for Lebanese to adhere to the directives of the Lebanon’s military.</p><p>In its statement late on Sunday, the Israeli military said it was “determined to continue to operate in accordance with the understanding between Israel and Lebanon, despite Hezbollah’s attempts to return to southern Lebanon.”</p><p>Tens of thousands of Israelis who were evacuated from their homes in northern Israel 15 months ago have been reluctant to return, fearing cross-border attacks from Hezbollah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In the Gaza Strip on Sunday, civilians displaced by war were likewise stymied from returning to their homes. Israeli troops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostage-yehud.html" title="">prevented them</a> from doing so after Israeli officials accused Hamas of violating the terms of the cease-fire agreement that went into effect a week ago.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Gazans near the Nuseirat refugee camp on Sunday waiting to return north.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Under the terms of the initial phase of the Gaza cease-fire <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/17/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire" title="">agreed to this month</a>, Israel had been expected to withdraw some of its forces and allow hundreds of thousands of uprooted Gazans to head north after a second <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages-oct-7.html" title="">hostage and prisoner exchange</a> on Saturday.</p><p>The Israeli government said Hamas had violated the deal by not adhering to the agreed order of hostage releases and by failing to provide Israel with information about the status of the captives still in Gaza who were seized when the militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>The dispute centered around one particular hostage, Arbel Yehud, an Israeli civilian. Ms. Yehud was supposed to be among the women released on Saturday as part of an exchange for Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons. Israel had demanded that its female civilians be released before female soldiers were.</p><p>But on Saturday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-spotters-hostages.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">four soldiers were released</a> in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>Hussein al-Batsh, an official of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller armed organization and sometime rival of Hamas in Gaza, told The New York Times on Sunday that Ms. Yehud was in the custody of the Quds Brigades, the group’s military wing. He said that Ms. Yehud was not released on Saturday for “technical reasons.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At a kibbutz in southern Israel, the home of Ariel Cunio and Arbel Yehud, two hostages seized in the Hamas attack, stood empty in December.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After a day of feverish talks to resolve the crisis, Qatar, one of the main mediators between Israel and Hamas, said close to midnight on Sunday that Hamas would hand over Ms. Yehud and two other hostages before next Friday, in addition to handing over three other hostages on Saturday.</p><p>Israel confirmed that Ms. Yehud would be released on Thursday along with Agam Berger, an Israeli soldier, and one other hostage. Israel also said it had received a long-awaited list from Hamas providing details about the status of the remaining 26 hostages due to be released in the first phase of the deal.</p><p>In return, Israel said it would allow the passage of Gazans to northern Gaza, starting on Monday morning.</p><p>On Sunday, images of a large crowd of displaced Palestinians waiting near <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/gaza-us-contractors.html" title="">the Netzarim corridor</a> — a zone built by Israeli forces that splits Gaza in two — to return north were circulating in Palestinian media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency, reported that one person had been killed and several others were wounded west of Nuseirat in central Gaza after Israeli forces fired at the crowd of people waiting to return north.

President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/middleeast/lebanon-politics-president-parliament-vote.html" title="">Joseph Aoun</a> and Prime Minister-designate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/world/middleeast/lebanon-nawaf-salam-prime-minister.html" title="">Nawaf Salam</a>, as they seek to wrest back some political control from Hezbollah and build a functioning state.</p><p>Experts warn that any prolonged Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon could breathe new life into Hezbollah, a group that was founded to liberate Lebanon from Israeli occupation and that has portrayed itself as the only force capable of protecting Lebanon’s borders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“As long as Israel is occupying Lebanon, it’s reviving the narrative of Hezbollah,” said Sami Nader, the director of the Institute of Political Science at Saint Joseph University of Beirut.</p><p>For those who managed to enter their villages in southern Lebanon, the scale of destruction was overwhelming. Entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble in the Israeli invasion that began on Oct. 1, 2024, which was aimed at crippling Hezbollah. The militant group began opening fire on Israel a day after the Hamas attack that set off the war in Gaza.</p><p>In the southern town of Aita al-Shaab, much of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-border-photos-video.html" title="">now lies in ruin</a>, residents walked through rubble-strewn streets and by flattened buildings. Among them was Mohamed Srour, the town’s mayor, who had been displaced more than a year ago after the strikes between Hezbollah and Israel began.</p><p>He said that Israeli soldiers had not yet fully withdrawn from the town and that they were firing sporadically at civilians. The claims could not be independently verified. Still, Mr. Srour remained resolute.</p><p>“Today, Aita is celebrating the long-awaited return,” he said. “The houses are destroyed and the livelihood is gone, but our will to live is stronger. We will build again.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lebanese taking in the destruction in Aita al-Shaab on Sunday caused by the Israeli air and ground offensive.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bilal Hussein/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Hiba Yazbek<!-- -->, <!-- -->Iyad Abuheweila<!-- -->, <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- -->, <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Myra Noveck<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hwaida Saad<!-- --> and <!-- -->Dayana Iwaza<!-- -->.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div><div><p>Thomas Fuller, a Page One Correspondent for The Times, writes and rewrites stories for the front page.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-fuller">More about Thomas Fuller</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
