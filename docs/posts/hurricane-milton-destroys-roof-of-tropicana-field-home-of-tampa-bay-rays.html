    <h1>Hurricane Milton Destroys Roof of Tropicana Field, Home of Tampa Bay Rays</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At around 10:45 p.m., Mr. Johnson “heard a loud flapping sound and saw a portion of the roof coming apart.” At first, he just saw a few tears in the east and west side of the roof. But once one panel blew away, the rest followed and a massive swath of the roof was almost completely destroyed in less than half an hour, he said in a telephone interview early Thursday morning.</p><p>“It just makes me sad seeing the stadium of the team I love ruined,” said Mr. Johnson, a St. Petersburg resident and a lifelong Rays fan.</p><p>Tropicana Field’s roof is slanted “to reduce cooling costs and to better protect the stadium from hurricanes,” according to <a href="https://www.tampabayfield.com/information/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the field’s website</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/RaysBaseball/status/1843043391229374515" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a> on Sunday, the Rays said that “Tropicana Field is NOT being used as a shelter,” and urged residents to remain updated about the storm through local officials.</p><p>Hurricane Milton made landfall near Sarasota on Wednesday. Large portions of Florida have seen significant flooding. Tornados have also wreaked havoc around the state, destroying homes and leading to some injuries and even death, according to at least one county official.</p></div></div>
