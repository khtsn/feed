    <h1>Moo Deng, the Toddler Hippopotamus, Still Has Star Power</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Moo Deng doesn’t bounce like she did a couple months ago.</p><p>But she still resembles a ripe avocado overstuffed with pâté. She retains a moist sheen. She snuffles. She yawns. She naps. She very occasionally sniffs her mother’s hindquarters, then recoils in a springy huff.</p><p>Mostly, Moo Deng ignores the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who have schlepped to an out-of-the-way zoo for one reason: her. She is, somewhat unaccountably, Thailand’s most famous creature in forever, human or pachyderm. Yet if she’s not in the pool, her eyes and nostrils peeking above the water, Moo Deng spends a lot of time snoozing in a secluded corner of her enclosure, sprawled like an abandoned sausage.</p><p>It is a lot for a 6-month-old pygmy hippopotamus, this life of intense celebrity. The visitors are mostly respectful, but there are exceptions, both foreign and Thai. There have been incidents of tossed bananas and of splashed water. The daily annoyances are the shrieks and gasps and the chorus of “Moo Deng, Moo Deng” at every flick of her tail, every wiggle of her bristly jowls. People have fainted in her presence, although Thailand’s sticky heat could have been a factor, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A person walks by a zoo entrance featuring a giant red hippo sculpture." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/multimedia/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl/00dispatch-moodeng-02-pjcl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/3a2d6b6c-f609-5502-99c3-4a43c9348c60" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The entrance to the Khao Kheow Open Zoo features a wire hippo sculpture.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Visitors, including a child wearing a Moo Deng shirt, on their way to see the famous baby hippo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last week, Hunter Hackett, a digital nomad from California, joined the Moo Deng receiving line with his wife, Anisi Baigude, a children’s book illustrator.</p><p>“I used to scoff at these trends, but now I want to be in on the next big thing,” Mr. Hackett said. “It reminds me of being young and innocent and being excited about, like, Pokémon.”</p><p>Moo Deng in Thai means bouncy pork, <a href="https://wham-o.com/collections/superball%C2%AE?srsltid=AfmBOopNRcTGvKUYemSBCxfZFm_WVSkBmlcl1U_N1H1L_egB0cZbRwiS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a kind of Super Ball meatball</a>.

The country has been locked in political drama for a couple of decades.

Pretty soon, Moo Deng was all over TikTok. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfIbbP3vuwA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Saturday Night Live” featured her</a>. In September, during the U.S. presidential campaign, she crushed former President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in an online “Tonight Show” election poll. Google graced her with a doodle, befitting one of the most searched terms of 2024.</p><p>In the last three months of 2024, the Khao Kheow Open Zoo tripled its number of visitors to nearly 600,000 people. Like <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/paul-the-octopus-who-predicted-world-cup-matches-dies/" title="">Paul the octopus</a>, who predicted soccer match winners, Moo Deng was offered two fruit and vegetable platters emblazoned with the names of Mr. Trump and Ms. Harris. She picked Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Narongwit said he personally preferred Mr. Trump because of the newly inaugurated president’s business acumen and determination. But he denied any fixing of the fruit baskets. And he is magnanimous about other recently born pygmy hippos, like Poppy in Virginia and Haggis in Scotland. </p><p>The one person unsurprised by Moo Deng’s rock star reception is her keeper, Atthapon Nundee. He was the one posting Moo Deng videos on his TikTok and Facebook accounts, as well as on the zoo’s social media accounts. He said he was intentional about building her online presence. Already, her older brother, Moo Toon, had shown glimpses of online acclaim, like in an image of him chomping on Mr. Atthapon’s leg. A winsome herd of capybaras under Mr. Atthapon’s care gained a following, too. And before that, the zookeeper debuted a two-toed sloth named Mr. Flash, whose slow-moving antics occupied Thais during the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Mr. Flash didn’t do too much,” Mr. Atthapon acknowledged. “He is a sloth.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Moo Deng striking an adorable pose in her enclosure.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Visitors whipping out their phones when they see Moo Deng.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>By the time Jona and Tony produced Moo Deng, an 11-pound blob about the size of a one-liter bottle of Coke, Mr. Atthapon said he knew exactly what kind of hippo action the world craved. He now has two million followers on TikTok and 400,000 on Facebook.</p><p>As for himself, he does not watch videos to relax, Mr. Atthapon said.</p><p>“I’m too busy taking care of the animals,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Atthapon, known by the nickname Benz, as in Mercedes, did not grow up dreaming of becoming a zookeeper. He took care of small dogs — Pomeranians, Shih Tzus, the odd Chihuahua — when he was a boy, but he drove trucks for a living. Eight years ago, he applied for a job at the zoo because his mother was a caddy at a nearby golf course. Instead of driving food delivery trucks for the animals, Mr. Atthapon was told to tend five types of animals, including two varieties of hippos: pygmy and common.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“They’re a lot larger than Chihuahuas,” he said, even the pygmy variety, which can weigh around 500 lbs.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The one person unsurprised by Moo Deng’s rock star reception is her keeper, Atthapon Nundee.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Livestreaming cameras beam Moo Deng to a global audience.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Last year, Mr. Atthapon was named one of Thailand’s most eligible bachelors by a local media group, but word has trickled out that he has a girlfriend.</p><p>The pygmy hippopotamus, or Choeropsis liberiensis, is endangered, with about 2,500 left in the wild in its native West Africa. Captive breeding populations are small. Poppy, the Virginian newborn, is Moo Deng’s cousin. Moo Deng’s half sister from her father’s side is also her mother’s granddaughter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Last week, the <a href="https://hilight.kapook.com/view/245457" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thai king’s sister presided</a> over what was described as a wedding between Moo Manao, or Lime Pork, and Moo Toon, Moo Deng’s brother. Buddhist monks blessed the couple. They are expected to mate in mid-February, a ritual that tends to take place underwater. For a country that has long tied itself to the elephant — which adorned Thailand’s flag when it was known as Siam — there is a new pachyderm in town.</p><p>Animal rights groups have denounced some captive breeding programs as good for zoos, but not for the future of an endangered species. And the Khao Kheow Open Zoo, despite its sprawling grounds, features some dilapidated exhibits. The penguins look dispirited, the lemurs dejected. A flock of yellow-billed storks, native to Africa, stalks the grounds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A stork wandering the Khao Kheow Open Zoo, which, despite boasting sprawling grounds, has some dilapidated exhibits. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Capybaras gathering near a small hut at the zoo.

But, she said, she now understood the hype.</p><p>Below her, in a shaded corner, Moo Deng dozed. Not an ounce of fat rippled. Her zoomies were done for the day.</p><p>A Thai woman remarked to another that Moo Deng was about as active as a pile of buffalo poop.
