Wisner II, a veteran American diplomat, Washington insider and foreign affairs specialist who relished the prestige of ambassadorial life as much as the back-channel cajoling and arm-twisting of less public influence, died on Monday at his home in Mill Neck, N.Y., on Long Island. He was 86.</p><p>Over decades as a member of the policy elite, Mr. Wisner headed embassies in Zambia, Egypt, the Philippines and India, held high office under both Republican and Democratic administrations and was linked to initiatives that wrought change in regions as disparate as southern Africa and the Balkans.</p><p>He rose to prominence at a time when the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union turned an emergent world of newly-independent states into a checkerboard of competition between Washington and Moscow and their various surrogates.</p><p>Gregarious and often expansive, Mr. Wisner brought his own style to the task of promoting America’s vision. In Cairo, for instance, where he was ambassador from 1986 to 1991, he once invited a reporter along to join him for an evening of diplomacy and socializing, crisscrossing the city in an armored Mercedes-Benz followed by a chase car of bodyguards as he was feted in a series of formal receptions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The guest list at his dinner parties offered a Who’s Who of the elite. And as the representative of Egypt’s most influential superpower ally, his interlocutors sometimes treated him like an affable viceroy.</p><p>Once, Mr. Wisner borrowed a friend’s apartment in Cairo to conduct unpublicized talks with exiled members of the Soviet-backed armed wing of Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress, at a time when official contact with such figures was unusual.</p><p>Mr. Wisner was the American ambassador in Egypt when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering a massive, American-led counter-invasion of Iraq — an event that sent tremors of apprehension through Western diplomatic corps across the Arab world. But while some missions evacuated their nationals or closed down their facilities, “we stuck,” Mr. Wisner said in an interview in 1998. “I had a sense of confidence in the Egyptian government’s ability to maintain control in the streets. I had confidence in the direction of our diplomacy and in the Egyptian association with us.”</p><p>“We read the Egyptians right,” he added. “They read us right. We and they were on the same wave length.”</p><p>During his time in Manila, where he had been posted as ambassador to help stabilize the coup-prone administration of Corazon Aquino, his office was part of the old American governor-general’s suite.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Cigar in hand, he loved to take visitors out on the giant veranda overlooking the bay and describe the sweep of American interactions with the Philippines, back to the days of the Spanish-American War,” The New York Times reported.</p><p>But, long after he retired from public duty in 1997 and embarked on a lucrative career as a senior adviser to private companies, Mr. Wisner’s final act of public diplomacy during the so-called Arab Spring of 2011 turned sour when he found himself at odds with the Obama administration and isolated from the mainstream of American policymaking.</p><p>At the time, as huge crowds gathered in Cairo’s central Tahrir Square to demand the ouster of the pro-American President Hosni Mubarak, President Barack Obama dispatched Mr. Wisner to deliver a message to his Egyptian counterpart, whom Mr. Wisner had to come to know well during his ambassadorship there.</p><p>President Obama wanted Mr. Mubarak to agree to begin relinquishing power immediately. But after just one meeting with Mr. Wisner, Mr. Mubarak balked, saying only that he would not stand for re-election in a scheduled vote months later but that he wanted to remain in office until then. Mr. Wisner, who also met Vice President Omar Suleiman of Egypt during his mission, was ordered to return to the United States.</p><p>Days later, speaking by video link to a big security conference in Munich, Mr. Wisner said it was crucial for Mr. Mubarak to stay on to manage his transition from office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Those remarks were instantly disavowed by both the State Department and the White House, whose representatives said that Mr. Wisner had been speaking in a personal capacity and that his views did not reflect official policy.</p><p>It was a rare and embarrassing public rebuke.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Crowds in Cairo were jubilant in 2011 at the news that President Hosni Mubarak had resigned, ending three decades of autocratic rule.

And there was absolutely no way we were going to decide the future of the Egyptian revolution, as we subsequently learned.”</p><p>Frank George Wisner II was born on July 2, 1938, in Manhattan to <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/10/30/issue.html" title="">Frank Gardiner Wisner</a> and Mary Knowles Wisner. His father was an intelligence operative in World War II who went on to join the Central Intelligence Agency, where he was credited with masterminding coups in Guatemala and Iran. He died by suicide in 1965.</p><p>The younger Mr. Wisner had two brothers, Graham and Ellis Wisner, and a sister, Elizabeth Gardiner Wisner, who died in 2020. Graham died in January. </p><p>In his youth, Mr. Wisner spent a year at England’s upscale Rugby School before going on to Princeton. He joined the State Department in 1961 and had early assignments to newly-independent Algeria, war-ravaged South Vietnam, Tunisia and Bangladesh.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 1969, he married Genevieve de Virel, a scion of a noted French family. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/12/archives/genevieve-wisner-33-wife-of-state-department-aide.html" title="">died in 1974</a>. They had a daughter, Sabrina.</p><p>In 1976, he married Christine de Ganay, who was also from an aristocratic French family. She was the former wife of Pal Sarkozy, the father of former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. David Wisner is their son. She had two children from her previous marriage, Olivier and Caroline Sarkozy. The couple later divorced. Mr. Wisner married Judy C. Cormier, an interior designer, in 2015.</p><p>He is survived by his wife and children as well as his brother Ellis and 12 grandchildren.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Wisner, as ambassador to India, met with Mother Teresa in Calcutta in 1996 to present her with an award of honorary American citizenship. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press Photo</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In interviews after his retirement from the State Department, Mr. Wisner made frequent reference to his role during the Nixon administration on the staff of Henry A. Kissinger as the White House pursued diplomacy to end a guerrilla war in Zimbabwe, then called Rhodesia, in the 1970s.</p><p>At the time, Moscow and Washington jockeyed for influence in a swathe of restive African lands, including Mozambique, Angola, Namibia and ultimately South Africa. In Angola, the rivalry had drawn in Cuban and South African troops fighting in support of opposing liberation movements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>When Mr. Wisner was ambassador to Zambia, from 1979 to 1982, part of his mission was to rebuild a close relationship with President Kenneth D. Kaunda after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/24/world/us-denies-zambia-s-charges-against-diplomats.html" title="">sensational disclosures</a> surfaced in 1981 about undercover C.I.A. activities there.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Wisner with President Fatmir Sejdiu of Kosovo in 2007.

Zambia was also a leading player in the so-called Frontline States, which had long provided rear bases and critical diplomatic support for liberation movements across the region.</p><p>“There were some hairy moments” as he sought to undo the damage, Mr. Wisner said in a 1998 interview for the Library of Congress.</p><p>Indeed, Mr. Wisner himself was an influential player in the Reagan administration’s policy known as “constructive engagement,” led by Chester A. Crocker, the former assistant secretary of state for African affairs. The core of the policy was a belief that the white minority regime of apartheid South Africa could be persuaded to loosen its grip on absolute power rather than fight ruinous conflicts against Black adversaries demanding majority rule.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In “High Noon in Southern Africa,” an account of American regional diplomacy published in 1992, Mr. Crocker referred to Mr. Wisner as “the dean of Southern Africa specialists,” who “possessed a breadth of foreign affairs background unmatched in our government” and who displayed “a polished, low-key manner and personal warmth.”</p><p>Throughout his career, Mr. Wisner alternated between overseas assignments and senior positions in Washington, including stints at the State Department and the Pentagon.</p><p>Even after his retirement from the diplomatic corps in 1997, he continued to combine private sector advisory roles with official missions. In 2005, the George W. Bush administration <a href="https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/58288.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appointed him as its special representative</a> in talks that led to the disputed independence of Kosovo in 2008.</p><p>From 1997 onward he built a second career in private business, serving as a vice chairman of the insurance giant A.I.G. and as an international affairs adviser for Squire Patton Boggs, a legal and lobbying group based in Washington.</p><p>In his later years, Mr. Wisner voiced concern about the way the United States had exercised its global power, starting with the Vietnam War in the 1960s and through to the decades of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“We seem to be impervious to learning from our mistakes, and, therefore, ended up in tragic excesses in Iraq and now in Afghanistan,” Mr. Wisner told the Council of Foreign Relations in June 2021, months before the chaotic American withdrawal from Kabul.</p><p>“I hope this period of American history, from the late 1960s through the present, will somehow settle into the American mind,” he said, “and we will be careful about how we use American power.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>After a long career as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times based in Africa, the Middle East and Europe, Alan Cowell became a freelance contributor in 2015, based in London.
