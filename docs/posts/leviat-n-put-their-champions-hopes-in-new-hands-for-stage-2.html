</span> has quickly evolved from a potential superteam contending for regional titles to a unique roster featuring both experienced, championship-level talent and high-potential rookies. Not only that, but the team also underwent some coaching changes, with assistant coach Desmo assuming the head coach role for the first time since mid-2023. </p>

<p>The roster turnover was significant, but even in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/509802/leviat-n-vs-loud-vct-2025-americas-stage-2-w1" target="_blank">their loss against LOUD to start VCT Americas 2025 Stage 2</a>, the potential is there for LEV to return to regional glory.</p>

<p>“We&#39;re working every day towards that goal of being a good team at Paris,” <span data-ref-id="1">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/195/desmo">
		Desmo	</a>
</span> said. “We&#39;re looking at Stage 2 as that springboard to not only get to Champs, but to be good at Champs.”</p>

<p>On paper, the roster in Stage 1 had two Championship-winning teammates reconnecting with <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/26171/demon1">
		Demon1	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="3">

</span>, the fragging IGL <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/1818/tex">
		tex	</a>
</span> to solidify the roster. However, as the roster started slow, the team failed to improve to make it to the Stage 1 playoffs and Masters Toronto. Demon1 and Rossy both moved to the inactive roster, but that opened the opportunity for two star players from tier two to join the team for Stage 2 onward.</p>

<p>Former M80 players okeanos and Sato joined the roster, and they had to fit into the roster relatively quickly if LEV wanted to make it to Paris. Thankfully, viewers wouldn&#39;t have to wait too long to see what the retooled roster would look like, as the Tixinha &amp; Sacy Invitational tournament featured four VCT Americas teams, including LEV, <span data-ref-id="7">

</span> for LEV, but it was the start of head coach Desmo&#39;s tenure, and it was an ideal beginning.</p>

<p>“I was head coach during the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2549/tixinha-sacy-invitational-by-bonoxs/main-event" target="_blank">Tixinha &amp; Sacy Invitational</a>, and worked in that role since the end of May,” Desmo said. “It felt nice to get some wins, even though it was an off-season tournament. It was good to get that experience, allowing the players to learn more about themselves. The goal was to learn how to adapt, and it was successful and fun.”</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/81Ml5oNfSNg?si=SWnzPrtc4GM5VDzY&amp;clip=Ugkx9rNDp9e_i07kqyjUhTxdRZGqn6rJtzuS&amp;clipt=EI_5sAUYzpmyBQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>okeanos gets a quick triple to stop a potential A push in the grand finals of the Tixinha &amp; Sacy Invitational.</em></p>

<p>Despite only winning one game in their three group stage games, the team improved in the playoff stage to sweep FURIA and win <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/511523/kr-esports-vs-leviat-n-tixinha-sacy-invitational-by-bonoxs-gf" target="_blank">a close five-map series 3-2</a> over KRÜ. Learning to adapt was key to that win, as both okeanos and Sato played four different agents in five maps. Sato rotated through the Duelist pool, playing four of the eight Duelists available in the game well, as okeanos tested out three Controllers as well as the Sentinel Deadlock. It was on that Sentinel that LEVIATÁN won Ascent, the final map of the series, to get a win on top of some needed teambuilding.</p>

<p>Both players have shown their potential in their games with the team so far, with Sato needing to fill the shoes of some big players who had that position in LEV. Sometimes replacing a role with a rookie is easy, but not when the last two Duelists your team had were Demon1 and aspas. Even for okeanos, he has to fit into a team and gel with them instantly, as almost any Controller or flex player has to do. </p>

<p>“They both have great ceilings, and they both told me that while they didn&#39;t enter the series nervously, the pressure from LOUD did affect them,” Desmo said. “I just think they need that stage experience to deal with that quickly. “</p>

<p>The biggest issue in that series was the aggression LOUD brought, as they were able to cause some panic when they pressed on both attack and defense. If LOUD were bringing those issues to the forefront, Desmo could only imagine what <span data-ref-id="13">

<p>There were plenty of positives exiting the loss against LOUD, moments that showed off how talented these two new players were. Sato had a dominant Yoru performance on map one, and the strong defense half from okeanos on Icebox nearly brought map three to overtime, if it wasn&#39;t for an amazing performance from <span data-ref-id="15">

<p>“Our practices have been good, but we just need to be able to convert that on stage,” Desmo said. “These rookies are smart; they can see how the veterans play and learn from it.”</p>
