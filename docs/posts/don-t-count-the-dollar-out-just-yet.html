The U.S. Dollar Index, a widely followed metric that compares the dollar with six currencies, has fallen almost 8 percent.</p><p>The swelling U.S. budget deficit has made many investors wary of U.S. government bonds. What’s more, the tariffs and the president’s disregard for the traditions of international diplomacy have damaged the status of the dollar and the U.S. Treasury bond as linchpins of the world financial system. The euro, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/economy/germany-tariffs-bonds.html" title="">German bonds</a> and gold have benefited from the dollar’s problems, accelerating trends underway for years. None of this is positive for the dollar.</p><p>Yet from other angles, the dollar looks stronger. It’s held its own against many currencies and remains highly valued, even after its recent decline. Most important, perhaps, is that there is no single replacement currency in sight. Like it or not, the dollar and the U.S. Treasury bond are essential in world commerce and finance. They remain essential for investors, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hedging your bets by holding assets around the world makes a great deal of sense. The euro, in particular, may well play a more important role in the future than it has over the last 20 years.</p><p>But don’t go too far with this. It’s too early to give up on the dollar or U.S. Treasuries.</p><h2 id="link-6d90566b">Some Perspective</h2><p>This is a volatile year.<span>  </span>After President Trump announced that he was raising U.S. tariffs to their highest levels in more than a century, many countries questioned whether the United States could still be trusted. Canada on Monday elected a prime minister, Mark Carney, on the promise that he will never accede to the aggressive aims of Canada’s erstwhile ally. “President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us,” <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mark-carney-repeatedly-attacks-donald-trump-victory-speech-2065405" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Carney</a> said. “That will never, ever happen. But we also must recognize the reality that our world has fundamentally changed.”</p><p>There’s no doubt that it has.</p><p>The dollar has taken a beating but it really hasn’t fallen all that much this year — at least not when you use broader measurements and take into account how high the dollar had risen.</p><p>While frequently cited, the Dollar Index <a href="https://www.ice.com/publicdocs/futures_us/ICE_Dollar_Index_FAQ.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">includes only</a> six currencies, with the euro accounting for almost 60 percent of its weight. That doesn’t give you a good sense of the dollar’s value in the world today. It mainly shows that the dollar has fallen against the euro.</p><p>For a broader perspective, the Federal Reserve assesses currency strength using several standards, including the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index — an assessment based on how much world trade individual countries transact. It gives a different picture. Using this index, the dollar is indeed down in 2025 — but by less than 5 percent through April 25. And against emerging market currencies, the Fed’s indexing shows that the dollar declined less than 3 percent. That’s just a small blip on a chart showing the dollar has <em>risen</em> sharply over many years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In fact, even without the damage inflicted recently by Mr. Trump’s policies, it’s possible that the dollar would be declining anyway, if only because it had reached historically elevated levels. Consider this performance:</p><ul><li><p>In 2024, the dollar rose more than 7 percent, measured by the Dollar Index, and 9 percent, using the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index.</p></li><li><p>Taking inflation into account by using the Fed’s Real Broad Trade-Weighted Index, the dollar rose almost 23 percent over the 20 years through March.</p></li><li><p>Late last year, using this broad, inflation-adjusted index, the dollar was stronger than it had been since 1985.</p></li></ul><p>The dollar’s high valuation had become a burden for many U.S. companies earning profits abroad, and it contributed to the U.S. trade deficit, making the dollar’s value a concern of the Trump administration.</p><h2 id="link-1d291f5d">The Mar-a-Lago Accord</h2><p>What happened in 1985 resonates today.</p><p>In those days, Japan, not China, was widely viewed in Washington as the main culprit behind U.S. trade deficits. The strong dollar helped to make U.S. exports expensive — and Japanese goods like Toyotas, Hondas and the Sony Walkman extremely attractive. Labor costs and manufacturing quality had something to do with the growing preference among U.S. consumers for foreign goods, but it was easier for U.S. politicians to deal with the dollar.</p><p>So the Reagan administration used diplomacy — and the implicit threat of overwhelming military and political power — to persuade its allies to participate in the devaluation of the dollar. This culminated on Sept. 22, 1985, in an agreement that became known as the <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21813/w21813.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plaza Accord</a>, because it was signed at the grand New York City establishment, the <a href="https://www.theplazany.com/history/timeline-history-of-the-plaza-hotel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plaza Hotel.</a> </p><p>A publicity-savvy real estate developer named Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/business/what-donald-trumps-plaza-deal-reveals-about-his-white-house-bid.html" title="">bought</a> the Plaza three years later. (Mr. Trump put his first wife, Ivana, in charge of renovating the old building, and he married his second wife, Marla Maples, at the hotel in December 1993, before selling it in 1995.)</p><p>Echoes of the Plaza Accord may be heard today. Well before Inauguration Day, with the dollar heading toward 1985 levels, the president-elect’s economic advisers discussed a hypothetical diplomatic agreement, calling this dream the “<a href="https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mar-a-Lago Accord</a>.” Pulling it off would have required subtlety and statesmanship. Instead Mr. Trump has been applying blunt force and bluster. And he has weakened the dollar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-63d6172">And Yet</h2><p>The president didn’t cause all of the dollar’s problems. Swelling budget deficits, rising debt levels and a dysfunctional political system began impairing both the currency and U.S. Treasuries at least as far back as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/06/business/us-debt-downgraded-by-sp.html" title="">2011</a>. That’s when Standard &amp; Poor’s, one of the three major credit rating agencies, downgraded the United States’ AAA rating. In 2023, after many <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/debt-limit-history/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debt-ceiling crises</a> and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-a-government-shutdown-and-why-are-we-likely-to-have-another-one/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government shutdowns</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/business/fitch-downgrade-us-credit-rating.html" title="">Fitch</a> followed suit.</p><p>This past March, Moody’s warned that it too might soon lower the U.S. government’s credit rating. The Trump administration and Congress are likely to extend expiring tax breaks and cut some taxes further, adding to deficit woes. Another debt ceiling impasse could come this summer. While tariffs will bring in revenue, they could set off a recession. There are plenty of reasons to worry about the United States.</p><p>By comparison, German government debt is still AAA. Since early 2012, investors have been eager to buy it, driving down interest rates. The difference, or spread, between German sovereign bonds and the 10-year Treasury is more than 1.5 percentage points (or 150 basis points, in bond jargon), and has occasionally exceeded two percentage points. The higher U.S. rates mean greater costs to taxpayers, as well as steeper mortgage and loan rates, which are drags on the economy.</p><p>Last month, the falling dollar and rising Treasury rates during a stock market sell-off raised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/bonds-tariffs-safe-haven.html" title="">questions</a> about whether the Trump administration had damaged the dollar’s “safe haven” status. German and Swiss debt rallied while Treasuries fell in price and yields rose. (Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions.)</p><p>What conclusions should you draw from this? I wouldn’t be too hasty.</p><p>First, it wouldn’t take much to send the dollar rallying again or to witness a surge in Treasury prices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Tariff effects vary from country to country. If the Federal Reserve holds rates steady on May 7 — or raises them later — while other central banks cut rates, the dollar may climb. And strong stock market performance could draw in foreign money, causing the dollar to appreciate.</p><p>More fundamentally, where are global investors to go? The euro isn’t widely enough used and the European bond market isn’t deep enough to replace Treasuries or the dollar, at least not yet. That’s also true for the Japanese yen. Chinese markets aren’t open enough to make the renminbi a true global currency, either.</p><p>A multipolar world is forming, yes, but the United States is likely to remain a great power, and perhaps the most formidable. Despite manifest flaws, U.S. political and economic systems retain enormous strength. In 2025, global investors simply can’t abandon the dollar.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeff Sommer writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/business-strategies">Strategies</a>, a weekly column on markets, finance and the economy.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
