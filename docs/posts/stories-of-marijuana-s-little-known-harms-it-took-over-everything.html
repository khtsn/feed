Most of the tens of millions of people using marijuana, for health benefits or for fun, don’t experience problems. But a growing number, mainly heavy users, have experienced addiction, psychosis and other harmful effects, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/cannabis-marijuana-risks-addiction.html" title="">The New York Times found</a>.</p><p>“Cannabis is a lot of things at once,” said <a href="https://education.musc.edu/MUSCApps/FacultyDirectory/Gray-Kevin" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Kevin Gray</a>, a psychiatrist and specialist in bio-behavioral medicine at Medical University of South Carolina Health. “It can be medically therapeutic. It also can be highly problematic.”</p><p>In interviews and surveys, hundreds of people told The Times about serious — sometimes frightening — symptoms that they were stunned to learn could be caused by cannabis. Here are some of their stories.</p><p>Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome</p><h3 id="link-5aa9bebf"><span>‘A Real Danger’</span></h3><p>David Krumholtz, an actor known for films like “10 Things I Hate About You” and TV shows like “Numb3rs,” resumed smoking marijuana in 2016, after a decade-long break. Within months, he started to experience cycles of intense nausea and vomiting — a sometimes debilitating condition called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. It can lead to dehydration, seizures, kidney failure, cardiac arrest and even death in rare instances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He lost 100 pounds and was in and out of emergency departments. At home in New Jersey, he would spend 10 hours at a time in hot baths, which for unknown reasons can temporarily relieve symptoms.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David Krumholtz said the symptoms he suffered nearly cost him his dream job.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I had numbness in my extremities, pain in my chest and my blood pressure skyrocketed,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Krumholtz, 46, believes he would have eventually died had he not suffered an episode that almost derailed his dream job, a role in the blockbuster 2023 film “Oppenheimer,” and inspired him to quit marijuana for good.</p><p>“It seems like such an innocent drug,” he said. “But for some of us, there is a real danger, a really harmful side effect.”</p><p>addiction</p><h3 id="link-4e6cb77f"><span>‘Every Day, All Day’</span></h3><p>Aimee Washington, a 44-year-old mother of four in Grand Rapids, Mich., starts smoking cannabis within a half-hour of getting up and consumes six joints. “It’s like an every day, all day thing,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>She can’t sleep without it. She can’t eat without it. When she tries to stop, she has panic attacks. “It took over everything,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aimee Washington has tried multiple times to quit cannabis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea Bruce for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>This summer, she thought again about quitting, but was daunted by the withdrawal symptoms she had experienced in the past: headaches, no appetite, mood swings, increased anxiety and insomnia so bad that she once stayed awake for several days.</p><p>“If I don’t smoke,” she said, “my anxiety is so high.”</p><p>In August, Ms. Washington started work at a local dispensary. The job has flexible hours and benefits, but it has made it even harder for her to quit using marijuana.</p><p>Psychosis</p><h3 id="link-75379582"><span>‘Like a Constant Whispering’</span></h3><p>While working a data-entry job at home in Richfield, Utah, during the pandemic, Annika Sheehan escalated her use of high-potency cannabis concentrates, eventually smoking every 15 minutes. She began hearing voices, seeing demons and experiencing other hallucinations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>These psychotic symptoms have trailed her over the past three years, as she has been diagnosed variously with PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and substance use disorder, and at times used marijuana heavily.</p><p>“Especially when I’m smoking, those voices become so much louder,” said Ms. Sheehan, 24. “It’s like a constant whispering in my ear and like these intrusive thoughts.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Annika Sheehan, now sober, has struggled with symptoms.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kim Raff for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>This year, a physician in a drug-treatment program who diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder explained that cannabis was likely contributing to her psychosis. “It was the first time someone connected the dots,” she said.</p><p>Now three months sober, she still sometimes hears voices and footsteps that aren’t there.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Twohey is an investigative reporter at The Times.
