She is taking the reins of the F.D.A.’s device division from Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, who forged deep ties with the device industry, sped up the pace of approvals and made the agency more approachable to companies.

The funds support the hiring of hundreds of agency employees who are assigned to maintain a brisk pace of product reviews.</p><p>The arrangement has its supporters, who note that the money allows the F.D.A. to be competitive in hiring scientists who can keep up with the rapid flow of innovation in biotechnology and other fields. But it has also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35149663/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drawn criticism over concerns</a> that it puts the F.D.A. to work for largely for-profit industries and compromises the agency’s efforts to protect public health.</p><h2 id="link-2be3b9f3">Lingering ethics issues</h2><p>Those concerns loom a bit larger as Dr. Tarver steps into the post of the outgoing device division director, Dr. Shuren.
