Blinken on Saturday met with Arab ministers in Jordan to discuss how to assist a political transition in Syria, nearly a week after rebels toppled the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>The Arab countries called for an end to hostilities in Syria and said they would support the transitional government there, according to a statement from Jordan’s Foreign Ministry.</p><p>The abrupt demise of the Assad government in Syria has prompted celebrations along with uncertainty over how the new interim administration there can manage a transition in a country shattered by 13 years of civil war and decades of repression.</p><p>It is another upheaval in a region already reeling from more than a year of war and has set in motion a realignment with implications for Turkey, Israel, Iran and Lebanon. It also affects the Russian government, which has given refuge to Mr. al-Assad and was a stalwart ally of his.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Blinken met in the coastal city of Aqaba with foreign ministers from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt, as well as the caretaker prime minister of Lebanon and secretary general of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, according to a statement by Jordan’s Foreign Ministry. Turkey, the United Nations and the European Union also participated, but representatives of Syria’s new leadership did not attend.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Antony J.

Just weeks ago, Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-arab-israel.html" title="">bring Mr. al-Assad</a> back into their fold after a rupture in relations over brutal treatment of his own people.</p><p>Days before Mr. al-Assad fell, top officials from Arab states, as well as from Turkey, Russia and Iran, met to try to contain the revolt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In recent days, Turkey has emerged with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-rebels-erdogan.html" title="">greater influence</a> in Syria, given its support of the offensive led by the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which overthrew Mr. al-Assad. Some Syrian rebel factions backed by Turkey joined forces with the group in the assault.</p><p>The Turkish government made plans this week to reopen its embassy in Damascus, Syria’s capital, which has been closed for almost 13 years. It also conducted military operations, including airstrikes, in northern Syria against Kurdish militants whom it considers a threat.</p><p>On Friday, the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, issued a stark warning to members of the Kurdish militia that controls northeastern Syria, the People’s Protection Units, or YPG.</p><p>“It is our strategic target to eliminate the YPG,” he said in an interview with the Turkish broadcaster NTV. He said any members who were not Syrian should leave the country as soon as possible, and added: “The entire command level of YPG should leave the country too. The remaining ones should continue living as they lay down their weapons.”</p><p>The Kurdish-led forces in Syria have been important partners with the United States in the fight there against the Islamic State terrorist group. The United States and Turkey are NATO allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Turkey, at the same time, has funded and trained a Syrian rebel force, the Syrian National Army, which provided security for Turkish military bases in northern Syria and helped it fight Kurdish-led forces in the country.</p><p>The commander of Syria’s largest Kurdish militia accused the United States this past week of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-isis-united-states-kurds.html" title="">abandoning its Kurdish allies</a> in Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A member of the Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham standing near a damaged mine-sweeping tank that had been disabled by an anti-tank mine on Friday in Taftanaz, northwestern Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Turkish officials told Mr. Blinken in Ankara that they shared Washington’s concern about the potential for an Islamic State comeback, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.

America is watching events there closely, the U.S. official said.</p><p>During his stop on Friday in Baghdad, Mr. Blinken stressed to the Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, that Iraq should be vigilant about any Iranian attempt to funnel weapons through the country to pro-Iranian militias within Syria who might use them for attacks there.</p><p>In response, Mr. Sudani told Mr. Blinken that Iraq was determined not to be dragged into any fights outside its borders, the official said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Working on Saturday in Idlib, Syria, to repair damage to residential buildings and a kindergarten that were hit by an airstrike in the final days before the Assad regime collapsed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>In another ripple effect of the rebel takeover in Syria, Russian forces appeared on Friday to be packing up some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/13/world/syria-news#russia-military-syria" title="">military equipment</a> at an important air base near the Syrian port city of Latakia in a possible prelude to a broader withdrawal.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Hmeimim base is a critical part of Moscow’s military foothold in the region.
