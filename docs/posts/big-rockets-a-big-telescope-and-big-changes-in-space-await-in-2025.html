Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/29/science/spacex-launch-mission-control.html" title="">SpaceX’s Falcon 9</a>, the booster stage is designed to be fully reusable so it can fly again and again and reduce the cost of launches.

Rubin Observatory, which might capture its first views of the night sky this year, as early as July 4.</p><p>Formerly the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the observatory was renamed in 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/11/science/vera-rubin-telescope-astronomy.html" title="">to honor Vera Rubin</a>, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/science/vera-rubin-astronomist-who-made-the-case-for-dark-matter-dies-at-88.html" title="">died at 88 in 2016</a>. Dr. Rubin’s work persuaded astronomers of the existence of dark matter, which makes up a vast majority of mass in the universe, but no one knows what it is.</p><p>The name is fitting. With the largest digital camera in the world, scientists will use the Rubin Observatory to create a time-lapse motion picture of the Southern sky. Such images would help researchers understand the nature of dark matter, as well as dark energy, the unknown force pushing the cosmos apart. The trove of data will also help reveal the story of our galaxy’s birth and catalog asteroids and comets in our solar system, including those that could slam into Earth one day.</p><h2 id="link-e507ca7">The moon, and Trump, come back around</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The core stage of NASA’s Space Launch System, the rocket that will be used for the Artemis II moon mission, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chandan Khanna/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>During the first administration of Donald J.
