For now, the data has all but erased analysts’ concerns, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">based on historical trends</a>, that the “hard landing” of a recession could be looming in the near future.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I actually think we are in the mother of all soft landings,” said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at the accounting firm KPMG, who had been among the prominent worriers.</p><p>Real-time estimates of overall economic growth remain strong. Productivity growth is robust, Ms. Swonk noted. Retail sales are solid. And interest rates, though high, have recently fallen.</p><p>“It appears the recovery is not only on solid ground, but will accelerate,” said Robert Frick, an economist at <a href="https://tracking.us.nylas.com/l/c3bca00cf3df40a3b64feb0dd26d0ffc/1/bcb72e30ccfeeec4bb0726ac3d757da32791231660f00276c14590c9f0c3e99b?cache_buster=1728047465" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Navy Federal Credit Union</a>. While “it pays to be skeptical” in the uncertain environment of the past year, he added, “the best news for American workers overall is wage growth remains good, and well above the rate of inflation — that means purchasing power is strengthening.”</p><p>Stocks rose on the news, as indications of a widely employed consumer base and a resilient economy are generally a boon to corporate earnings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Federal Reserve officials will welcome the healthy September data, though its strength may cause them to reduce interest rates more gradually.

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Beyond the latest jobs reading, there are a variety of bright spots in the economic environment.</p><p>For much of the past few years, a range of experts believed that unemployment would have to rise steeply, and that a recession was necessary, if inflation was to be fully tamed. But the broad-based price pressures seem to have largely been resolved — with time, improvements in supply chains, the cooling of energy markets and the return of discounts in retail sales.</p><p>And it has happened without deep deterioration in the labor market — “pain,” as the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, put it two years ago — or a contraction in economic activity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Lower-income households, however, are struggling with higher rent and food prices. Surveys indicate that consumers are still dour about the two-year bout of rapid inflation that ate into their purchasing power. But after peaking at 7.2 percent in 2022, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge has fallen to 2.2 percent, only a couple of tenths of a percentage point away from policymakers’ official target.</p><p>A common presumption among academics and top analysts on Wall Street was that pay gains, which surged for workers during pandemic-era labor shortages, would have to fall much more sharply than they have if inflation was to ease to tolerable levels.</p><p>The boomlet in productivity that businesses and workers are experiencing may be helping vigorous wage growth and cooling inflation to coexist. Fitter, more efficient businesses can, generally, pay workers more and enhance profits without relying mainly on price increases.</p><p>“With strong productivity, you can have strong wage growth,” said Sonu Varghese, the macroeconomic strategist at Carson Group, a financial firm. “I think that is a lot of what people missed, and are still missing.”</p><p>Households’ disposable income is growing at a stout 3.1 percent annual pace, when adjusted for inflation, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. And over the past five years, according to the economic research team at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, personal income for U.S. households has increased 35 percent, outpacing the estimated 23 percent cumulative increase in prices during that period.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The net worth of American households is up 11 percent over the past year and 47 percent, or $50.1 trillion, over the past five years, not adjusted for inflation. J.P. Morgan estimates that the average homeowner has over $400,000 in home equity, compared with $240,000 five years ago.</p><p>Along with the labor market, the U.S. stock market has outperformed as well. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is up roughly 20 percent since the start of the year, providing a boost to tens of millions of Americans’ savings.</p><p>Two-thirds of U.S. households are in owner-occupied homes, and a vast majority have a fixed-rate mortgage, which has served as a shield against housing inflation.</p><p>That widely shared benefit, though, underscores the hefty slice of the American population that has captured fewer gains in wealth and incomes. The average rate on all outstanding mortgages is about 3.6 percent. But those looking to move, or renters trying to become first-time home buyers, are facing far higher home prices and higher interest rates.</p><p>That has driven measures of home affordability to multidecade lows and leaves many families, especially younger ones, feeling sour about their future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Brittany Pino, the owner of a real estate firm in Baton Rouge, La., says mortgage applications have risen since the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate last month, which made September the best month for her firm this year.</p><p>But she is worried that many discouraged potential buyers — who have been hoping and waiting for market rates for mortgages to fall further — will “end up disappointed” in two ways. Rates might not fall much further in a strong economy, and if they do, more competition from other buyers (with the same idea) will arise and potentially drive pricey bidding wars again.</p><p>“The problem is just Economics 101, supply and demand: We don’t have enough homes,” Ms. Pino said, even in markets like Baton Rouge that are less expensive than those in larger metropolitan or coastal areas.</p><p>So affordability issues — not only in housing but also in child care, elder care and health care — are still vexing the country. But the economy is dealing with “nothing but first-world problems,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for the consulting firm RSM, and it is outpacing growth in every other rich nation.</p><p>Data can be revised downward. And economies do not experience finish lines. Time keeps passing. Risks to growth, geopolitical and otherwise, are lurking. The coast is never clear.</p><p>But sometimes, even in a large and complex economy, good news is mostly just good news.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
