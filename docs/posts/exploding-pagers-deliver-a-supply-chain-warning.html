So complex that it is probably beyond the powers of governments, corporations and other interested institutions to police. Even the most sophisticated participants are often unclear on who they are relying on for critical parts and raw materials, or where the risks lie. </p><p>The clear lesson of the supply chain upheavals that accompanied the pandemic was that the longer the journey entailed in making any product, the greater the chance that something might go awry, inflicting delay and higher costs.</p><p>Now there’s a potent yet related concern: The more complicated the journey, the greater the exposure to mischief. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Every movement along the way, and every additional company brought into the manufacturing process represents an opportunity for those pursuing violent agendas to insinuate themselves into the works and weaponize the product.</p><p>“Companies must decide which level of security must be implemented in their supply chains,” Hannah Kain, the chief executive of ALOM, a global supply chain company, told DealBook. “We just moved several notches out on the paranoia scale.”</p><p><strong>The Lebanon attacks will most likely accelerate supply chain changes.</strong> In recent years, a growing group of labor activists, politicians and critics of liberalized trade has urged American companies to move production back home, or at least closer to the domestic market. So-called reshoring and nearshoring have been advanced as a means of limiting reliance on faraway factories — especially those in China — while insuring against the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/business/supply-chain-small-business.html" title=""> perils of international shipping</a>.</p><p>The reality that international supply chains are susceptible to being penetrated by those waging war is bound to boost it further.</p><p><strong>Concerns over national security risks have in recent years been focused on specific high-risk situations:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Much of the world is dependent on factories in China for critical items like face masks, ingredients for critical medicines and parts for ventilators and other medical devices.</p></li><li><p>China might attack Taiwan, menacing the stocks of advanced computer chips concentrated on the self-governing island.</p></li><li><p>Faced with international sanctions following its attacks on Ukraine, Russia has cut shipments of energy to Europe.</p></li><li><p>In the United States, those who view China as a threat to national security have warned that Chinese-made telecommunications and electrical gear could be a Trojan Horse for crippling attacks on basic American infrastructure.</p></li></ul><p><strong>But the recent attacks reveal how even less strategic and lower-profile areas of commercial life entail grave security risks. </strong>At ports around the globe, the volume of goods being moved in shipping containers is so vast that no authority can possibly inspect more than a fraction. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the wake of the Lebanon attacks, politicians are likely to face pressure to extend the push for reshoring and nearshoring beyond the most strategically vital goods like computer chips and electric vehicles. New policies may broaden the drive to concentrate industry in the United States and in friendly countries that can offer assurances of armoring supply chains against outside intervention.</p><p><strong>Both the Trump and Biden Administrations urged companies to move supply chains closer to home. </strong>President Trump affixed across-the-board tariffs on Chinese goods, a policy extended by the Biden administration. And the Biden administration has lavished tens of billions of dollars in subsidies on companies that are constructing computer chip plants and electric vehicle factories in the United States. The government has also looked to spur the production of active ingredients for pharmaceuticals.</p><p><strong>Many U.S. companies have already started to reel in production. </strong>Product shortages and spiking shipping costs during the pandemic caused major companies like<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/01/business/mexico-china-us-trade.html" title=""> Walmart</a> and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/business/columbia-sportswear-nearshoring-central-america.html" title=""> Columbia Sportswear</a> to shift some of their production from Asia to countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The land port at<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/business/us-mexico-trade-laredo.html" title=""> Laredo, Texas</a> — a hub of trade between the United States and Mexico — eclipsed the docks of Southern California, long the gateway for Asian-made factory goods.</p><p>Faced with the uncomfortable possibility that their foreign factories could be susceptible to rogue actors, American multinational companies may move more aggressively to shift production to countries where the risks are less. In the cost-benefit analysis that has long propelled factory jobs out of the United States to countries where labor is cheaper and regulations lighter, the value of making goods at home just went up.<span>  </span></p><p><strong>Yet contrary to some premature obituaries, globalization is not dying. </strong>Abandoning international trade would be expensive and fraught with disturbance. Instead, globalization is being reconfigured, with new value placed on cutting the distance between factories and markets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>All of this has come in response to the growing sense that the United States must make sure it has ample stocks of critical elements, rather than entrusting its fate to supply chains spanning oceans. For those inclined to this view, the exploding pagers ultimately delivered a flashing alert. </p><p><em>— Peter S.

In 2023, the average size of women-led venture funds was $41 million, compared to $244 million for all venture funds, according to The Venture Capital Journal.</p><p><strong>Early-stage funding for women-founded startups has increased</strong>. In 2023, these companies received 7 percent of pre-seed and seed funding and 4 percent of Series A and B funding, up from 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, in 2015, according to Crunchbase.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>But more mature companies led by women have not seen the same boost in funding.</strong> For women-founded companies seeking funding past the Series B round, the share of venture capital dollars contracted to 1 percent from 2 percent over the same period.</p><p><strong>A backlash to D.E.I. investing hasn’t helped. </strong>In June, a court halted a competition by the venture capital firm<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-court-decision-casts-shadow-diversity-venture-capital-funding-2024-07-02/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Fearless Fund</a>, which offered grants to businesses owned by Black women. The court ruled that the grant likely constitutes unlawful racial discrimination. Angela Lee, the founder of the angel investing network 37 Angels, says she has since seen fund managers “tweaking the language on their publicly facing content to prevent the possibility of a lawsuit.”</p><p><strong>What’s the solution? </strong>More women investors writing bigger checks might not be enough. A<a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/full/10.1287/orsc.2022.1594" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> study</a> conducted by researchers at INSEAD, the business school, found that exclusive backing from female investors could inadvertently signal to later investors that a start-up is being funded based on a founder’s gender rather than on merit. Kaisa Snellman, a co-author of the study, emphasized that male-led venture firms need to address bias and support women founders. “It shouldn’t just be up to the women investors to even the playing field,” she said.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-3e2ff224">Lazard’s chief, one year in</h2><p>There are few executives that sit more at the nexus of Wall Street and the Washington than Peter Orszag, the chief executive of Lazard, who previously served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget under Obama.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Orszag took over as C.E.O. last <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/business/dealbook/lazard-ceo-orszag.html" title="">October</a>, at a time that the bank was facing steep pressure from slowing deals and a dwindling share price. Shares of the bank have since rebounded more than 50 percent as the firm’s financial advisory business <a href="https://lazardltd.gcs-web.com/static-files/226df57b-e785-42ef-9dfe-32429afb4b6c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notched record revenue</a>.</p><p>DealBook spoke with Orszag about the Fed’s recent interest rate cuts, the political backdrop and the bank’s turnaround. This interview has been edited and condensed.</p><p><strong>The Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point interest rate cut on Wednesday sparked an array of responses, from exuberance to charges that it was politically motivated. What was your initial reaction?</strong></p><p>There was always the risk, which I thought Powell navigated pretty well, of 50 looking a little desperate. They claim everything is not political, and I believe them, but from a political perspective, you could make the argument that 25 basis points would have been a safer bet. And I think what that really highlights, in a highly politicized environment, is they literally aren’t political. They didn’t do the political thing, which would have been 25.</p><p><strong>Powell seemed to suggest he may have been late in lowering the rate and would have cut it sooner had he known the unemployment numbers in July.<span>  </span>Is the 50 basis point cut a makeup for being late?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>I think they just wanted to see the world play out a little bit more. Once you start this, you don’t want to flip back.</p><p><strong>One of the Fed governors dissented for the first time in 20 years, arguing that inflation could return. What did you think of that?</strong></p><p>Dissents happen. And they proceeded despite the dissent, which says something.</p><p><strong>What does it say?</strong></p><p>The other voting members clearly felt sufficient conviction that 50 basis points was the right call. Or, alternatively, there were going to be more dissents in the other direction if the decision came out the other way.</p><p><strong>One of the things you said was a priority when you first came in as Lazard’s C.E.O. was more deals. PJT recently acquired Dubai-based DeNovo. Do you expect to make any acquisitions of your own?</strong></p><p>We did make a hire in our own corp dev office. It’s disproportionately focused on the asset side of the business, and opportunities that we see there in wealth management and private assets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>I would note the acquisition you mentioned is in the Middle East. We just got our official license to operate in Saudi: we created an office in Riyadh. We’re very excited about the path in the Middle East. But it’s an organic one.</p><p><strong>Shortly before you took over, Lazard </strong><strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/abu-dhabi-based-adqs-talks-take-lazard-private-fall-apart-ft-2023-06-20/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flirted</a></strong><strong> with a take-private by ADQ. The bank Rothschild announced plans to go private last year. Is Lazard better off private?</strong></p><p>I think Lazard’s independence is core to much of what we do. There are successful firms that are public, there are successful firms that are private. Most of the things that we need to do are basically the same, whether we are public or private, so I view that as not in the first bucket of priorities in terms of what will lead to success at Lazard.</p><p><strong>Thanks for reading!
