    <h1>JD Souther, Who Wrote Hits for the Eagles, Dies at 78</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>JD Souther, who crafted many of the biggest hits to come out of the Southern California country-rock scene of the 1970s, including for the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor, and who later played a wizened music industry veteran — in other words, a version of himself — on the hit television show “Nashville,” died on Tuesday at his home in Sandia Park, N.M., in the hills east of Albuquerque. He was 78.</p><p>His death <a href="https://www.jdsouther.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was announced on his website</a>. A cause was not provided.</p><p>Beginning in the late 1960s, Mr. Souther was part of a coterie of musicians around Los Angeles who found themselves circling the same sort of peaceful, easy, country-inflected rock sound. They played at the same venues — among them the Troubadour, the famous West Hollywood nightclub — and lived and partied in the same canyons in the Hollywood Hills.</p><p>Mr. Souther played with or wrote for most of them. Though he was brought up on jazz and classical music, he easily mastered the country-rock vernacular on songs like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGmUYlsXTD4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Faithless Love</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-trzAMKRzk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">White Rhythm and Blues</a>,” for Ms. Ronstadt; “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRrT37ruAtE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Heart of the Matter</a>,” which he wrote with Don Henley; and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9zEHFynDsE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Her Town Too</a>,” a collaboration with Mr. Taylor that they sang as a duet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He also played a central role in the formation of the Eagles, encouraging Ms. Ronstadt, his girlfriend at the time, to hire his friend Glenn Frey as part of her backup band. After Mr. Henley joined, he and Mr. Frey decided to form their own group, along with two other members of Ms. Ronstadt’s ensemble, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/18Souther-02-hcgf/18Souther-02-hcgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/18Souther-02-hcgf/18Souther-02-hcgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/18Souther-02-hcgf/18Souther-02-hcgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A black-and-white photo of seven rock musicians waving to the audience from the stage." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/18Souther-02-hcgf/18Souther-02-hcgf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/18Souther-02-hcgf/18Souther-02-hcgf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/18Souther-02-hcgf/18Souther-02-hcgf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/18Souther-02-hcgf/18Souther-02-hcgf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="364"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Souther, third from left, onstage with the Eagles in San Diego in 1979.

All along he maintained a solo career, and he finally had a hit of his own with “You’re Only Lonely,” the title track of his 1979 album, which reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Souther finally had a hit of his own with “You’re Only Lonely,” the title track of his 1979 album, which reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Columbia</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It was a banner year for him: The Eagles’ final No. 1 hit, “Heartache Tonight,” which he wrote with Mr. Henley, Mr. Frey and Bob Seger, peaked that fall.</p><p>Afterward, Mr. Souther largely retired from music. The Los Angeles scene was moving away from his style of music, as was the industry in general.</p><p>“I had done what I wanted to do musically,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/songwriter-j-d-souther-stumbles-into-his-role-in-nashville-92776/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he told Rolling Stone in 2012</a>. “And I just thought to myself, ‘All the men in my family worked until they died, and I’m going to take a few years off and build a great house and have a life.’”</p><p>By the late 1980s, he had taken up acting: He had a small role as a piano player in Steven Spielberg’s 1989 film, “Always,” and he played an environmental activist in several episodes of the TV show “Thirtysomething.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He also returned to recording and performing, this time with a jazzy style that brought him back to his roots. He recorded four studio albums and a live record; his most recent album, “Tenderness,” was released in 2015. He had been scheduled to perform with the singer-songwriter Karla Bonoff in Folsom, Calif., and Napa, Calif., later this month, and he also had a series of solo concert dates booked into 2025.</p><p>In recent years he was better known, at least to younger fans, for his screen presence. In 2012 he joined the cast of “Nashville,” playing a veteran music producer, Watty White — a character that drew heavily on his own experiences in the industry. He appeared during the first season, and his character was popular enough that the showrunners brought him back for the fifth season.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Souther, left, in a scene from a 2012 episode of the television series “Nashville” with, from left, Clare Bowen, Sam Palladio and Charles Esten.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Bomboy-Thornton/Disney General Entertainment Content, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>John David Souther was born on Nov. 2, 1945, in Detroit, though when he was very young his family moved first to Dallas, and then to Amarillo, Texas, where he grew up.</p><p>His father, John Souther, sang for a big band under the stage name Johnny Warren, a job that kept him constantly on the road. His mother, Loty (Finley) Souther, eventually protested, and after the family moved to her home state, Texas, Mr. Souther ran a music store.</p><p>The store became a cradle for JD’s musical career, the place where he was exposed to a wide variety of styles and performers in between helping his father sweep the floors and stock the record bins. He took up the violin when he was 8 and then the clarinet, tenor saxophone and drums.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>He briefly attended Amarillo College but left to pursue music with his first band, the Cinders. He moved to New York, then Florida, and finally Los Angeles, where he met Ms. Ronstadt and Mr. Frey.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and Mr. Souther in 1977.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Steve Schapiro/Corbis, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He married Alexandra Sliwin in 1969; they divorced in 1972. In addition to Ms. Ronstadt, he later dated Stevie Nicks and the singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/obituaries/judee-sill-overlooked.html" title="">Judee Sill</a>, who is said to have written her song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTAesI73E1U" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jesus Was a Cross Maker</a>” about him.</p><p>Another marriage, to Sarah Nicholson, also ended in divorce. Survivors include two sisters, Susan Burt and Shari Smeaton.</p><p>Mr. Souther moved to Nashville in 2001 and later to rural New Mexico. He insisted he was happy that his songs were more famous than he was.</p><p>“I like the fact that I don’t get made up before I go out of the house or check to be sure my hair looks great,” he told Variety in 2010. “I don’t really want to be stopped when I’m in the grocery store and have somebody pay a bunch of attention to me. It’ll be nice if that happens, but it’s not what I want.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Clay Risen is a Times reporter on the Obituaries desk.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div>
