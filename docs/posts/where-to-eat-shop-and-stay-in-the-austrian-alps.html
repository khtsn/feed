Depending on which peaks they’re targeting, visitors often fly into Zurich or Munich and then rent a car or take a train into the mountains (Munich to Salzburg is about a two-hour train trip). Sohm prefers to connect through Frankfurt to the Innsbruck airport, which is “small but very efficient,” he says. For a ski vacation here, there’s not much need for a car, notes Liechtenstein. “You walk out of your hotel and you’re at the lifts,” she says.</p><p>From November through March, winter sports are the main draw. Many vacationers also come to soak in the area’s natural springs, which are clustered in historic spa towns like Bad Aussee. “Checking into a hotel with thermal baths, soaking and eating and going for walks is the Austrian ideal of a perfect weekend,” says Liechtenstein. There are also several notable places to see art and design and explore local crafts like glassmaking and woodworking. And once the snow melts, the region is “basically paradise” for hikers and bikers, says Sohm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>With so many opportunities to build up an appetite, it makes sense that food here tends toward the hearty. (“You can at least find fish now,” says Liechtenstein. “That wasn’t the case 20 years ago.”) There are several ambitious restaurants and a local custom of notably lavish hotel breakfasts, but for Sohm as well as for the stylist Robert Rabensteiner, who grew up in an Austrian family in the South Tyrol region of Italy and considers knoedel — bread dumplings — far and away his favorite dish, it’s “homey food” that appeals. “I like a restaurant that looks the same as it has forever, where it’s like stepping into another time,” Rabensteiner says.</p><p>Perhaps the most popular places to fill up — at least during snow season — are the “huts” at the top of the slopes, where après-ski crowds wash down dumplings and kaiserschmarrn (caramelized, chopped-up pancakes served with rum-soaked raisins and sugar) with copious amounts of alcohol. “There’s this very Austrian thing about having one too many drinks on the mountain and then skiing down,” says Liechtenstein. “Coming from Italy, where after a ski day we go home and shower and put on makeup and high heels — even if it’s snowing — I thought it was insane that everyone was dancing and flirting in their ski boots. But now I get it. You can take the last lift up, dance, have drinks and then ski down again: You just ski a little slower.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-22ad70c6"><span>The Insiders</span></h3><p><strong>Alice Liechtenstein </strong>is an Italian-born, Austria-based design curator who founded <a href="https://www.schlosshollenegg.at/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Schloss Hollenegg for Design</a>, a residency program and exhibition space for emerging designers.</p><p><strong>Robert Rabensteiner</strong> is a fashion consultant who hails from the Austria-adjacent South Tyrol region of Italy and now splits his time between Milan and the Dolomites.</p><p><strong>Aldo Sohm </strong>is a sommelier, winemaker and author and the proprietor of <a href="https://www.aldosohmwinebar.com/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aldo Sohm Wine Bar</a> in Manhattan.
