But in Choczewo — a district in northern Poland dotted with farms, forests and white-sand beaches — the debate over nuclear energy is very real.</p><p>It started 40 years ago with an ill-fated Communist-era plan to construct Russian-designed reactors at a nearby lake. That effort buried a village in concrete and became a lightning rod for anti-Russian sentiment, but, aborted in 1990 by Poland’s first post-Communist government, it never produced electricity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Poland, which has since joined NATO, is trying again.</p><p>Plans are underway to place three American-made Westinghouse reactors on the Choczewo district’s Baltic shore, just 10 miles from the abandoned ruins of the Soviet plant. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The beach in Slajszewo, near where the nuclear power plant would be constructed, is part of an area of spectacular natural beauty.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Expected to cost more than $35 billion, it would be Poland’s first operating nuclear plant, a project of huge economic and strategic significance. The venture is an emblem not only of Poland’s close relations with the United States but also of wider geopolitical calculations in a region badly shaken by the war in Ukraine.</p><p>“We’ve been really pulling out the stops for this project,” said Andrew Light, the Biden administration’s assistant secretary of energy for international affairs. The reactors, he said, would advance a U.S. goal of helping countries across Eastern and Central Europe to “disentangle themselves from Russian energy.”</p><p>Referring to the plant at a meeting in 2022, President Biden advised his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, to “get it done,” according to the U.S. ambassador to Poland, Mark Brzezinski, who attended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Energy security is the holy grail in overall security,” Mr. Brzezinski said, hailing the nuclear plant as “the most significant expression of our relationship with Poland since it joined NATO in 1999.”</p><p>There has been overwhelming support in Poland for a nuclear plant touted by Warsaw and Washington as a guarantee of long-term energy security and as a cure for a heavy dependence on carbon-emitting coal.</p><p>Poland has weaned itself off Russian gas and petroleum since Moscow launched its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a> in 2022, but it still generates nearly three-quarters of its electricity from fossil fuels.</p><p>Even many Polish environmentalists, after years of protesting, have dropped opposition to what the International Energy Agency says could be <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/electricity/nuclear-power" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“a new dawn for nuclear energy.”</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Daniel Nowak, a Roman Catholic priest in Wejherowo, near Choczewo, helped oppose a Communist-era plant in the 1980s.

Locals are divided on the plan, with some cheering the prospect of cleaner, cheaper energy and others aghast at having reactors on their doorstep.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“This is one of the most beautiful places in Poland,” said Daniel Nowak, a Roman Catholic priest in Wejherowo, near Choczewo, who helped rally opposition to the Communist-era plant in the 1980s because “it would all have been controlled by the Russians.”</p><p>He said he had no problem with Westinghouse reactors, noting that “America is an ally, not an enemy,” but, like many residents, he says, “They should go somewhere different.”</p><p>The odds of that happening are slim. Moving ahead on the plan is one of the few things that Poland’s divided political camps agree on. “It will definitely happen, definitely,” said Maciej Bando, an official in Warsaw overseeing the project for the center-left administration. The plans were also embraced by the previous, right-wing government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Heading for the beach through the site where the nuclear power plant would be constructed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“After the shock of Chernobyl, we can see that the whole world is now considering a return to nuclear power,” Mr. Bando added.</p><p>He said that it was “entirely normal that not everyone is in favor,” but predicted that the plant would “bring gigantic benefits to the local community,” like increased tax revenue. The location, he added, “is not subject to change.”</p><p>Work recently started on felling pines to make way for survey teams studying whether the land could bear the weight of the Westinghouse reactors. The plant, which would be built by Bechtel and would not start producing electricity for more than a decade, is to cover an area equal to about 70 football fields and would bring in around 20,000 construction workers and engineers to Choczewo, which currently has fewer than 6,000 residents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A sign protesting the construction of the nuclear power plant near Choczewo.

But, he added, “As a resident of Slajszewo, I’m against it.” The nuclear reactors, he said, “could be put somewhere else.”</p><p>The project also envisages constructing a railway line, roads and a pier to be used for shipping in equipment and building materials. The pier would jut 1,000 yards into the Baltic from Slajszewo’s forest-fringed beach, a place of spectacular natural beauty.</p><p>A dirt track through the forest to the sea at Slajszewo is now bordered by an expanse of treeless, sandy land sealed off by fences that carry messages lauding nuclear power.</p><p>“When we first heard what they were doing, we were so angry,” said Alina Treder, who was walking back from the beach with her husband recently. But, she acknowledged, “It could be good for our children if we can stop poisoning the air with coal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An antinuclear booth at the harvest festival in Choczewo.
