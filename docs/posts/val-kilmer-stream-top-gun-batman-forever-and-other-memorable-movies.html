Kilmer’s Caped Crusader in “Batman Forever” (1995) was stoic enough.

With aviators on, hair thickly gelled and a crisp white uniform, Iceman is a smooth-talking pilot with skills to match. “It’s the way he flies,” the character Goose says in one scene. “Ice-cold.

But as the third fiddle, Kilmer offers up a softer aspect of the film in an oft-quoted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3rv0BdxWfM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conversation</a> with De Niro about his relationship. “Allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner,” De Niro advises. “For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man,” Kilmer responds.</p><p>Stream, rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70020509?source=35" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.faadea57-f7ab-26aa-6cda-8d880566e5b3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prime</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uRtHUnAo5U" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/heat-1995/umc.cmc.556ij13yd85l0n92qpyi9ptf1?action=play" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV</a> or <a href="https://athome.fandango.com/content/browse/details/Heat-Directors-Definitive-Edition/905927" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fandango</a>.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-2f96dba8">‘The Doors’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>One of Kilmer’s most celebrated performances was in the role of Jim Morrison, the musician and frontman of the 1960s rock group The Doors. In the 1991 film, directed by Oliver Stone, Kilmer gave a vividly stylized performance opposite Meg Ryan (who played Pamela Courson, Morrison’s partner). The movie covers the years when Morrison was a film student in Los Angeles through his death in Paris in 1971 at age 27.

Even as he executes a number of heroic deeds throughout the film, Holliday is a jaundiced, perspiring wreck who is clearly drinking himself to death. “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Im-Your-Huckleberry/Val-Kilmer/9781982144906" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I’m your huckleberry</a>,” Kilmer says, once in an early scene and again in a climactic confrontation.</p><p>Stream, rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-184d0f39-341e-47c6-b3b8-d48b78959293" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Disney+</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tombstone-Kurt-Russell/dp/B003SI84D6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prime</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoGPBQd6eA8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/tombstone/umc.cmc.3ove75bj1gj5p07a2z7cgi6sp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV</a> or <a href="https://athome.fandango.com/content/browse/details/Tombstone/12580" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fandango</a>.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-6a8502f">‘Top Secret!’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In this 1984 Cold War spy spoof from the creative team behind “Airplane!” Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, a dashing rock ’n’ roller in the Elvis Presley mold who becomes an unwitting cog in a plot to reunite Germany when he is sent to perform at a cultural festival.
