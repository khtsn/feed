    <h1>Harvard Professors Sue Trump Administration Over Threat to Federal Funds</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.</p><p>The Trump administration has been on a campaign against elite universities that it views as being too lax on antisemitism. In a recent letter to Harvard, the administration said the school had “fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence.” Other top schools like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">Columbia and Cornell</a> have also been targeted.</p><p>Harvard did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. In recent weeks, Alan Garber, the university president, has said that Harvard had spent “considerable effort” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/republicans-harvard-funding.html" title="">during the past 15 months addressing antisemitism</a>, adding that there was still more work to be done.</p><p>In a statement, Andrew Manuel Crespo, a law professor at Harvard and general counsel of the AAUP-Harvard Faculty Chapter, said the administration’s policies are a pretext to chill universities and their faculties from engaging in speech, teaching and research that don’t align with President Trump’s views.</p><p>“Harvard faculty have the constitutional right to speak, teach and conduct research without fearing that the government will retaliate against their viewpoints by canceling grants,” Mr. Crespo said.</p><p>On Saturday afternoon, hundreds of protesters, including students, professors and even the mayor of Cambridge, braved the cold to protest against the Trump administration’s threat to cut Harvard’s funding. At a packed park in Cambridge, Mass., home to Harvard’s campus, they called on the university to lead the charge against the government’s crackdown on higher education.</p></div></div>
