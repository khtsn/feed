The administration also sent the school a list of demands that it must meet if it wants to keep the funds.</p><p>The suit, filed in the Federal District Court in Massachusetts, <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/user_files/user_files/000/122/747/original/File_Stamped_Complaint.pdf?link_id=5&amp;can_id=d3129221e723eb1d1177481f44232471&amp;source=email-press-release-412-harvard-faculty-sue-trump-administration-to-block-unlawful-funding-cuts&amp;email_referrer=email_2694897&amp;email_subject=press-release-412-harvard-faculty-sue-trump-administration-to-block-unlawful-funding-cuts&amp;&amp;" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seeks</a> a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from cutting the funds.</p><p>“This action challenges the Trump administration’s unlawful and unprecedented misuse of federal funding and civil rights enforcement authority to undermine academic freedom and free speech on a university campus,” the lawsuit said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.</p><p>The Trump administration has been on a campaign against elite universities that it views as being too lax on antisemitism. In a recent letter to Harvard, the administration said the school had “fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence.” Other top schools like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">Columbia and Cornell</a> have also been targeted.</p><p>Harvard did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. In recent weeks, Alan Garber, the university president, has said that Harvard had spent “considerable effort” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/republicans-harvard-funding.html" title="">during the past 15 months addressing antisemitism</a>, adding that there was still more work to be done.</p><p>In a statement, Andrew Manuel Crespo, a law professor at Harvard and general counsel of the AAUP-Harvard Faculty Chapter, said the administration’s policies are a pretext to chill universities and their faculties from engaging in speech, teaching and research that don’t align with President Trump’s views.</p><p>“Harvard faculty have the constitutional right to speak, teach and conduct research without fearing that the government will retaliate against their viewpoints by canceling grants,” Mr. Crespo said.</p><p>On Saturday afternoon, hundreds of protesters, including students, professors and even the mayor of Cambridge, braved the cold to protest against the Trump administration’s threat to cut Harvard’s funding. At a packed park in Cambridge, Mass., home to Harvard’s campus, they called on the university to lead the charge against the government’s crackdown on higher education.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Harvard possesses not just the resources to withstand the pressure,” said Mayor Denise Simmons of Cambridge, “but the moral obligation to do so.”</p><p>Miles J.
