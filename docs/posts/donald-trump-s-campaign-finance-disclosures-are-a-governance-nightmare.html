Now we should focus on the rules governing political spending, which are in equally terrible shape. For that we can blame the Trump campaign and the federal government’s feeble enforcement efforts.</p><p>Anyone who has spent time reviewing Donald Trump’s campaign spending reports would quickly conclude they’re a governance nightmare. There is so little disclosure about what happened to the billions raised in 2020 and 2024 that donors (and maybe even the former president himself) can’t possibly know how it was spent.</p><p>Federal Election Commission campaign disclosure reports from 2020 show that much of the money donated to the Trump campaign went into a legal and financial black hole <a href="https://campaignlegal.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/01-28-21%20Trump%20MUR%207784%20supplement.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly controlled</a> by Trump family members and close associates. This year’s campaign disclosures are shaping up to be the same. Donors big and small give their hard-earned dollars to candidates with the expectation they will be spent on direct efforts to win votes. They deserve better.</p><p>During the 2020 election, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/campaign-expenditures/vendor?cycle=2020&amp;vendor=American+Made+Media+Consultants" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">almost $516 million</a> of the over $780 million <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jared-kushner-trump-campaign-shell-company-ramon-cota-2020-12" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spent by the Trump campaign</a> was directed to American Made Media Consultants, a Delaware-based private company <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-accused-pass-vendors-obscure-170-million/story?id=72020510" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created in 2018 that masked the identities</a> of who ultimately received donor dollars, according to a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-accused-pass-vendors-obscure-170-million/story?id=72020510" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">complaint filed with the F.E.C. by the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center</a>. How A.M.M.C. spent the money was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eric-trump-deputy-kushner-campaign-spending-shell-company-2020-12?op=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a mystery even to Mr. Trump’s campaign team</a>, according to news reports shortly after the election.</p></div></div><div><div><p>All but 18 of the 150 largest expenditures on a Trump campaign’s 2020 F.E.C. report went to A.M.M.C. None of the expenses were itemized or otherwise explained aside from anodyne descriptions including “placed media,” “SMS advertising” and “online advertising.” F.E.C. rules require candidates to fully and accurately <a href="https://www.fec.gov/updates/interpretive-rule-on-reporting-ultimate-payees-of-political-committee-disbursements/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disclose the final recipients</a> of their campaign disbursements, which is <a href="https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/murs/7784/7784_31.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usually understood</a> to include when payments are made through a vendor such as A.M.M.C. This disclosure is intended to assure donors their contributions are used for campaign expenses. Currently, neither voters nor law enforcement can know whether any laws were broken.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jared-kushner-trump-campaign-shell-company-family-ammc-lara-2020-12?op=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A.M.M.C.’s first president was reported to be Lara Trump</a>, the wife of Mr. Trump’s son Eric. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/us/politics/lara-trump-served-on-the-board-of-a-company-through-which-the-trump-political-operation-spent-more-than-700-million.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">The New York Times reported</a> that A.M.M.C. had a treasurer who was also the chief financial officer of Mr. Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/18/how-the-trump-family-grift-grew-out-of-the-presidents-paranoia-about-brad-parscale/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed off</a> on the plan to set up A.M.M.C., and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eric-trump-deputy-kushner-campaign-spending-shell-company-2020-12?op=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of</a> Eric Trump’s deputies from the Trump Organization was involved in running it.</p><p>Ms. Trump is now a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, which, soon after her arrival, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-campaign-fundraising-rnc-c0e8f1e7b59f70c5237e13a3462e5790" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced it would link up with the Trump campaign</a> for joint fund-raising. The joint entity prioritizes a PAC that pays Mr. Trump’s legal fees over the R.N.C., <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-campaign-fundraising-rnc-c0e8f1e7b59f70c5237e13a3462e5790" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press has reported</a>, making assurances from Mr. Trump’s campaign co-manager that R.N.C. funds wouldn’t be used to pay Mr. Trump’s legal bills seem more hollow.</p><p>This election, the Trump campaign and four of its PACs have paid Red Curve Solutions, another private company, at least $18 million. <a href="https://campaignlegal.org/press-releases/clc-files-complaint-alleging-illegal-payment-set-trump-legal-fees" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Campaign Legal Center says</a> Red Curve appears to pay Mr. Trump’s legal bills and then gets reimbursed by the PACs. (The law is murky on what types of legal bills can be paid by campaigns, but some are allowed.) The head of Red Curve also serves as the treasurer for the Trump campaign as well as the affiliated PACs.</p><p>What percentage of donor contributions go to lawyers defending Mr. Trump? It’s impossible to know.</p><p>In June, NBC <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/mystery-fundraising-firm-takes-millions-trump-campaign-rcna156755" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revealed the existence</a> of a new mystery company, called Launchpad Strategies. Launchpad <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?committee_id=C00770941&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2024&amp;cycle=2024&amp;line_number=F3X-21B&amp;data_type=processed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took in almost $15 million in Trump political cash</a> via the Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee and the Trump National Committee. Little is known about this new group. It was created in 2023 and the Trump campaign says it is related to fund-raising. We don’t know who owns it, who runs it or where the $15 million went.</p></div></div><div><div><p>It seems likely Mr. Trump is keeping close tabs on donations flowing through campaign vehicles controlled by family members and loyalists. But from early March through July of this year, the Biden and now Harris campaign <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d82000ee-b141-48ec-8af0-b06802c08f88" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outspent the Trump campaign</a> three to one on advertising. By late May, the Democratic campaign had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/23/biden-trump-finances-00164566" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened 200 field offices and hired 1,000 staff members</a> in key states. The Trump campaign <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/news/trump-2024-campaign-opens-office-023212019.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">didn’t open its first office</a> in the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania until June. The Biden campaign <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/30/politics/biden-campaign-offices-election/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had 24 there in April</a>.</p><p>Biden’s campaign also spent donor cash on legal bills, though apparently in far smaller quantities. It paid over $1 million for attorneys during a special counsel probe of the president’s handling of classified documents, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-legal-fees-bauer-dnc-trump-fec-14213a9ccd8c8ae61b37c16c22acdd9c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press reported in April</a>.</p><p>Maybe the Trump campaign is saving up for a post-Labor Day blitz to the finish line. Or perhaps Brad Parscale, whose strategy firm <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-myths-of-the-genius-behind-trumps-reelection-campaign" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took in</a> $94 million from Trump-affiliated groups in the 2016 campaign, spent every cent of that to re-elect the president. We know he seems to have paid himself handsomely. He bought a $2.4 million Fort Lauderdale waterfront property, a BMW X6, a Range Rover and a Ferrari. When Mr. Trump learned of Mr. Parscale’s high-rolling lifestyle, he reportedly exclaimed, “That’s my money!” according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-exploded-at-brad-parscale-over-his-lifestyle-spending-book-2021-7?op=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Bender’s book on the Trump campaign</a>. Concerns about Mr. Parscale <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/18/how-the-trump-family-grift-grew-out-of-the-presidents-paranoia-about-brad-parscale/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> drove Mr. Kushner to ensure A.M.M.C. was fully controlled by the Trump family and trusted lieutenants.</p><p>Donors should demand more information about how their money is spent. But that would most likely offend the Trump family and confidants running the campaign. And the whole point of donating to Mr. Trump is to get on his good side.</p><p>And — just hypothetically, of course — if Vice President Kamala Harris opens up her lead in the polls and the odds fall that Mr. Trump could win, who would be surprised if the unknown owners of the mystery companies paid themselves more while the campaign spigots are blasting cash and the future uncertain?</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Federal Election Commission should demand that all campaigns disclose recipients of more than $200 in campaign cash. At least that’s what the law says. Campaign Legal Center tried to get the F.E.C. to enforce disclosure rules on the Trump campaign. The commissioners voted 3 to 3 to dismiss the matter, and federal courts have declined to step in. The legal center has appealed the case to the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p><p>The commission, long famous in Washington for its dysfunction, now seems incapable of its most basic enforcement role. The agency reportedly had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/us/politics/fec-deadlock-deregulation.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">only three open investigations</a> in June despite the proliferation of hundreds of new campaigns and PACs. Congress should demand it better police the recipients of campaign contributions. And if the law is inadequate, Congress should make new ones.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Juleanna Glover is the chief executive of Ridgely Walsh, a corporate consultancy, and a former adviser to George W.
