The inquiry has examined possible bribery and money laundering in the city’s leasing of commercial properties, several people said in September.</p><p>But the district attorney’s office has also been examining other possible crimes, some of the people said. They include allegations that involve Ms. Lewis-Martin’s son, Glenn Martin II, a professional D.J.; Mayank Dwivedi, a hotelier who owns and operates several properties in New York City and the Hamptons; and one of his business associates. Those allegations appear to be the focus of the possible charges this week, the people said. Their precise nature was unclear, but that aspect of the investigation has focused on possible bribery and official misconduct, the people said.</p><p>The investigation appears to be continuing, and there is no indication that it is focused on Mr. Adams, who is facing trial in April on unrelated federal charges including bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin’s lawyer, Arthur L. Aidala, said in a statement that he and his client have been aware of the investigation since her phones were seized.</p><p>“The only thing of which we are certain is that Ingrid Lewis-Martin has served this city admirably for decades in an ethical, moral and law abiding manner,” the statement said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
