The inquiry has examined possible bribery and money laundering in the city’s leasing of commercial properties, several people said in September.</p><p>But the district attorney’s office has also been examining other possible crimes, some of the people said. They include allegations that involve Ms. Lewis-Martin’s son, Glenn Martin II, a professional D.J.; Mayank Dwivedi, a hotelier who owns and operates several properties in New York City and the Hamptons; and one of his business associates. Those allegations appear to be the focus of the possible charges this week, the people said. Their precise nature was unclear, but that aspect of the investigation has focused on possible bribery and official misconduct, the people said.</p><p>The investigation appears to be continuing, and there is no indication that it is focused on Mr. Adams, who is facing trial in April on unrelated federal charges including bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin’s lawyer, Arthur L. Aidala, said in a statement that he and his client have been aware of the investigation since her phones were seized.</p><p>“The only thing of which we are certain is that Ingrid Lewis-Martin has served this city admirably for decades in an ethical, moral and law abiding manner,” the statement said.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Martin and Mr. Dwivedi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Dwivedi’s associate declined to comment.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin said in her statement announcing her resignation that she planned to spend more time with her family. The statement, which was issued before The New York Times reported the possible charges against her, did not address the investigation. Her resignation from the post, where she was paid approximately $287,000, was first <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/15/ingrid-lewis-martin-eric-adams-aide-resigns-00194411" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> by Politico New York.</p><p>Addressing the mayor, she said: “I extend humble gratitude to you for encouraging me to be my authentic self and for having my back during some trying times. As you would say, this has been a good ride; I will use author’s license and say that this has been an amazing ride.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Viewed as the second most powerful person at City Hall, Ms. Lewis-Martin has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/nyregion/eric-adams-advisers.html" title="">part of Mr. Adams’s inner circle</a> for decades, becoming known as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-adams.html" title="">fiercely loyal lieutenant</a> who could make deals and fend off threats from opponents.</p><p>In a statement on Sunday in response to her resignation, Mr. Adams said Ms. Lewis-Martin “has not been just a friend, a confidante and trusted adviser, but also a sister.”</p><p>“We’ve always talked about when this day would come, and while we’ve long planned for it, it is still hard to know that Ingrid won’t be right next door every day,” he said. “I, and every New Yorker, owe her a debt of gratitude for her decades of service to our city.”</p><p>The presentation of evidence to a grand jury and the possibility of criminal charges against Ms. Lewis-Martin, the mayor’s closest confidant who has worked with him for decades, could hardly come at a worse time for Mr. Adams.</p><p>The first-term mayor’s trial in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/nyregion/eric-adams-corruption-trial-date-court.html" title="">April</a>, will come just months before he will seek a second term in the 2025 mayoral election. Three other federal corruption investigations focused on some of his most senior aides — all of whom resigned after those inquiries became public — appear to be grinding along.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Grand juries like the one focused on Ms. Lewis-Martin conduct their work in secret, and little is publicly known about the evidence that prosecutors put before the panel. They can ask its 23 members to vote to indict, but that does not ensure that charges will be brought. The jurors could determine that the evidence is insufficient to support criminal charges.</p><p>Spokeswomen for the office of the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, and the city’s Department of Investigation, which is conducting the investigation with the prosecutors, both declined to comment.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin’s conduct has come under some scrutiny in connection with several other investigations involving Mr. Adams and members of his inner circle, according to records and people with knowledge of those inquires.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index-articleLarge-v20.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Tracking Charges and Investigations in Eric Adams’s Orbit</h2><p>Five corruption inquiries have reached into the world of Mayor Eric Adams of New York. Here is a closer look at the charges against Mr. Adams and how people with ties to him are related to the inquiries.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The mayor’s indictment describes a July 2022 meeting with Turkey’s then-consul general at the nation’s new consulate building, which was attended by the mayor’s longtime Turkish liaison and Ms. Lewis-Martin, among others.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The indictment identifies her as his “senior adviser,” and the meeting appears in her appointment calendars. The indictment says the liaison, Rana Abbasova, at some point told the then-consul general to contact Ms. Lewis-Martin with any concerns regarding construction at the consulate, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/nyregion/eric-adams-investigation-turkey-consulate.html" title="">expedited opening</a> in 2021 was a focus of the bribery charge against Mr. Adams.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin has also received two federal grand jury subpoenas in connection with investigations into the mayor and his inner circle, people with knowledge of the matter have said. One came from federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who sought information in connection with the investigation that resulted in the mayor’s indictment, and the other came from federal prosecutors in Brooklyn who are investigating Mr. Adams’s former liaison to the Chinese community, Winnie Greco.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin and Mr. Adams, a retired police captain, met in 1984, she has said, through her husband, Glenn Martin, a friend of Mr. Adams’s at the police academy. When Mr. Adams decided to run for the State Senate in 2006, he asked her to serve as campaign manager.</p><p>After he became Brooklyn borough president in 2014, Ms. Lewis-Martin, his deputy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-adams.html" title="">pushed the limits of ethics rules</a>, supporters of the mayor told The Times last year. In one instance, as leader of a nonprofit that Mr. Adams used to promote himself and the borough, she asked real estate firms that had business with the borough president’s office to donate, colleagues said, a possible conflict of interest.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin’s goddaughter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/nyregion/eric-adams-brianna-suggs-fundraiser-fbi.html" title="">Brianna Suggs</a>, has figured in the separate federal investigation that led to Mr. Adams’s indictment in September on bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy and campaign finance charges. Ms. Suggs was Mr. Adams’s chief campaign fund-raiser, and her home was searched by federal authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/nyregion/eric-adams-brianna-suggs-fbi-raid.html" title="">late last year.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After Mr. Adams won the mayoral election in 2021, several of his supporters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-adams.html" title="">urged him</a> not to put Ms. Lewis-Martin in City Hall. Still, Mr. Adams named her his top aide. She would go on to serve as what many viewed as a divisive force within city government, overriding other officials and feuding with one of Mr. Adams’s top deputy mayors.</p><p>When the district attorney’s investigators took Ms. Lewis-Martin’s phones at the airport on Sept. 27, they also seized the phones of several of her traveling companions, including Jesse Hamilton, a top New York City real estate official and former state senator who is close to both the mayor and Ms. Lewis-Martin, and Diana Boutross, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/nyc-aides-bribery-investigation-bragg.html" title="">broker involved in city leases</a> who has raised money for the mayor, the people said. Their conduct also appears to be under scrutiny as part of the investigation.</p><p>Ms. Boutross and her lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Hamilton’s lawyer, Mark Pollard, said he was unaware of any wrongdoing by his client, adding, “However, we will fully cooperate with any pending investigation because he wants to clear his name and his reputation.”</p><p>At the airport, either shortly before or after members of the group had their phones seized by the district attorney’s investigators, federal investigators separately served Ms. Lewis-Martin with the grand jury subpoenas from prosecutors in both Brooklyn and Manhattan, people have said.</p><p>And on the same day, the investigators from the district attorney’s office also searched Ms. Lewis-Martin’s Brooklyn home and seized the phone of her son, Mr. Martin, who was not on the trip, two of the people said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Days later, they seized the phones of four more people, at least some of whom have close ties to Ms. Lewis-Martin, some of the people said. They include Joseph Douek, a longtime member of the City Planning Commission appointed to his position three times by Mr. Adams; Gina Argento, the chief executive of a soundstage business that controls a number of large properties around the city, who came under scrutiny a decade ago in a campaign finance investigation of Mr. Adams’s predecessor, Bill de Blasio; and two hoteliers.</p><p>One of those, Weihong Hu, has <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/12/12/guide-to-eastern-district-adams-probe/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">close ties</a> with the mayor. The other, Mr. Dwivedi, describes himself on LinkedIn as a “real estate entrepreneur, hotelier and restaurateur.” </p><p>A lawyer for Ms. Hu, Benjamin Brafman, said she was not a target of the investigation. Mr. Douek did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Ms. Boutross, the real estate broker, and Ms. Argento, the sound stage executive, made several appearances on Ms. Lewis-Martin’s schedules, records show.</p><p>In August 2022, Ms. Lewis-Martin was slated to have dinner with Ms. Boutross at Casa Cipriani, a private club in Lower Manhattan. The next night, she was scheduled to dine with Ms. Argento, a longtime donor to Mr. Adams, at an undisclosed location. Two months later, she was scheduled to have another dinner with Ms. Boutross and to attend a film and television production industry meeting that Ms. Argento’s brother Tony also attended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The following year, Ms. Boutross would be tapped to manage one of the city government’s main office space brokerage accounts, despite her relative lack of relevant experience in that specialty.</p><p>A lawyer for Ms. Argento, her husband, John J. Ciafone, said she had “absolutely not” engaged in any wrongdoing and suggested that the scrutiny was related to her well known <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/06/13/keep-mcguinness-moving-greenpoint-broadway-stages-gina-argento/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposition to street-use changes along McGuinness Boulevard</a> in Brooklyn.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
