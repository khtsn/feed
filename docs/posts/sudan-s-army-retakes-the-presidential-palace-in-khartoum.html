    <h1>Sudan’s Army Retakes the Presidential Palace in Khartoum</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Sudanese military forces recaptured the presidential palace early Friday in the battle-scarred capital, Khartoum, signaling a potential turning point in Sudan’s devastating civil war, now approaching its third year.</p><p>Soldiers posted triumphant selfie videos at the entrance of the devastated palace, which overlooks the Nile River, after days of heavy fighting with the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., the powerful paramilitary group that the army is battling for control of Sudan.</p><p>“We’re inside!” shouted an unidentified officer as cheering soldiers swarmed around him in one video posted Friday morning. “We’re in the Republican Palace!”</p><p>Still, the R.S.F. fought back for the rest of the day on Friday, firing missiles from armed drones that hovered over the palace compound, Sudanese military officials said. One of them struck a crew from Sudan’s state television station, killing two journalists and a driver.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Two officers from the military’s media wing, including its top official in Khartoum, were also killed in the attack outside the palace.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/17/world/africa/walsh-thumb-1/walsh-thumb-1-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><h2>The Battle for Sudan’s Capital</h2></figcaption></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The palace, an emblem of power in Sudan for two centuries, appeared to be in ruins. But retaking it was a major symbolic victory for Sudan’s army, which lost most of Khartoum to the R.S.F. in the early days of the war in April 2023, leaving its forces confined to a handful of embattled bases scattered across the vast city.</p><p>It was a strategic win, boosting the military’s drive to expel the paramilitaries from Khartoum entirely, following a six-month counteroffensive that has swung the balance of the war in the military’s favor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Only days earlier, the R.S.F. leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/15/world/africa/hamdan-hemeti-sudan-rsf.html" title="">Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan</a>, had vowed to stand his ground. “Do not think that we will retreat from the palace,” he said last week in a video address from an undisclosed location.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But on Thursday the military pressed hard on its target with a blistering assault on R.S.F. positions that ultimately forced the paramilitaries to flee.</p><p>The victory celebrations on Friday were shared by the unlikely coalition of Sudanese militias that fight under the army. They included hard-line Islamists; battle-tested fighters from the western region of Darfur; and some of the civilian revolutionaries who in 2019 helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/africa/omar-bashir-sudan.html" title="">oust Sudan’s authoritarian leader</a>, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who had ruled for three decades.</p><p>By Friday evening, it was unclear if the R.S.F. intended to defend the territory it still held in the south of the city, or begin to withdraw to its stronghold in western Sudan. Analysts noted that the paramilitaries were left with a single escape route — a narrow bridge over a major dam on the Nile at Jebel Aulia, 25 miles south of the capital.</p><p>Sudan’s military has previously bombed approach roads to the dam, causing quiet consternation among international aid groups, worried that serious damage to the dam could set off catastrophic floods downriver.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21sudan-2-mlwf/21sudan-2-mlwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21sudan-2-mlwf/21sudan-2-mlwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21sudan-2-mlwf/21sudan-2-mlwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A donkey cart loaded with people moves down a dirt road past a battered building and a burned-out car." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21sudan-2-mlwf/21sudan-2-mlwf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21sudan-2-mlwf/21sudan-2-mlwf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21sudan-2-mlwf/21sudan-2-mlwf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21sudan-2-mlwf/21sudan-2-mlwf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/78f524cc-b511-5a77-a584-95e75eff9a9f" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Much of Khartoum has been laid to waste in the fight for control of the capital. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Sudan’s war erupted in April 2023 after months of tension between the military chief, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/15/world/africa/sudan-military-abdel-fattah-al-burhan.html" title="">Gen. Abdul Fattah al-Burhan</a>, and General Hamdan of the R.S.F. The two men had seized power together in a military coup in 2021, but they could not agree on how to integrate their forces.</p><p>The R.S.F. had the upper hand for the first 18 months of the war, backed by external support from foreign sponsors including the United Arab Emirates and Wagner mercenaries from Russia.</p><p>But since the military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/world/africa/sudan-army-operation-capital-khartoum.html" title="">launched a major counteroffensive</a> in September, its forces have recaptured states in southeastern Sudan and gradually pushed the R.S.F. out of Khartoum.</p><p>After taking several strategic bridges on the Nile, the military seized the north and east of the city in recent months, before turning its sights on the presidential palace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>That sprawling compound, on the southern bank of the Blue Nile, has long occupied a central place in Sudan’s history. Established in the early 19th century under Ottoman-Egyptian colonization, the palace has been destroyed and rebuilt several times.</p><p>It was the scene of a famous colonial-era episode in 1885, when followers of a revolutionary cleric, Muhammad Ahmad, who was known as the Mahdi, killed the British ruler of Sudan, Gov. Charles Gordon, on the steps of the palace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The heavily damaged presidential palace before it was taken by the army, as seen from a ruined luxury apartment building across the Blue Nile.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In 2015, Mr. al-Bashir opened a new palace, funded and built by China, next to the colonial-era one.

Apartment blocks stood torched or looted, and banks were blown open. White smoke billowed from a giant wheat silo.</p><p>In the city center, army snipers trained their rifles through the windows of a deserted luxury apartment block overlooking the Nile. On the far bank, a riverboat slumped on its side. A surveillance drone buzzed overhead.</p><p>A lace curtain billowed around Sgt. Maj.
