    <h1>Wall Street Expects Half-Point Fed Rate Cut</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lower rates (all else being equal) would be supportive to the stock market, easing borrowing costs for companies and increasing the value of investors’ holdings.</p><p>But it also matters why rates are being cut. If the Fed is cutting rates aggressively because policymakers are worried about the economy, stock prices are likely to slide. Right now, the hope among investors seems to be that the Fed will act fast so it can stay ahead of any potential economic weakness.</p><p>“I think investors are hopeful they get the best of both worlds,” said Alan McKnight, chief investment officer at Regions Bank.</p><p>There are some signs of caution among investors. The gains in recent weeks have been led by real estate and utilities, with the former seen as a primary beneficiary of lower rates and the latter a more defensive bet as the economy slows. The technology stocks that led the market rally for so many years have slipped over the past month.</p><p>Andrzej Skiba, head of U.S. fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management, said he did not see the case for a larger rate cut with the economy still in solid shape. But, he added, not all investors are in agreement at the moment.</p></div></div>
