Trump’s potential cabinet members to the Senate this week to shore up support for the president-elect’s picks, but he’s leaving with only one.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/matt-gaetz-withdraws-attorney-general.html" title="">Matt Gaetz withdrew</a> from consideration as the next attorney general on Thursday amid allegations of sexual misconduct, one day after Mr. Vance tried to muster support for him on Capitol Hill. His withdrawal came less than 45 minutes after another embattled cabinet pick, Pete Hegseth, Mr. Trump’s choice for defense secretary, faced a direct question about his own sexual assault accusations.</p><p>After finishing meetings with senators in Mr. Vance’s office, Mr. Hegseth, a Fox News anchor, emerged from behind closed doors and told reporters that he looked forward to the confirmation process. A reporter immediately brought up the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/police-report-sexual-assault-claim-hegseth.html" title="">2017 allegations</a> of sexual misconduct, asking: “Did you sexually assault a woman in Monterey, California?”</p><p>“As far as the media is concerned, I’ll keep this very simple,” Mr. Hegseth replied. “The matter was fully investigated, and I was completely cleared. And that’s where I’m going to leave it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Concerns about Mr. Hegseth’s path to confirmation grew on Wednesday night when a newly released police report provided <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/police-report-sexual-assault-claim-hegseth.html?smid=url-share" title="">graphic details about a 2017 sexual encounter</a>, which Mr. Hegseth maintains was consensual.</p><p>On Thursday, some Republican senators defended Mr. Hegseth, emphasizing that no charges were filed in the case. After meeting with him in Mr. Vance’s Senate office, Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee attributed the allegations to “the media’s focus on personal attacks,” calling Mr. Hegseth “the right guy to inspire the Pentagon.”</p><p>Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, referred to accusations as “press reports.”</p><p>“I think he’s going to be in pretty good shape,” Mr. Wicker said after meeting with Mr. Hegseth for roughly 20 minutes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President-elect JD Vance, center, worked to increase support for President-elect Donald J.

It is not clear whether senators will concede to that plan or whether Mr. Trump might resort to a novel maneuver to force it.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/hegseth-sexual-assault-accuser.html" title="">has told advisers he is standing by Mr. Hegseth</a> as his pick despite the sexual assault allegation. Mr. Hegseth’s lawyer said Sunday that in 2020, his client had paid the woman an undisclosed amount because Mr. Hegseth was afraid he would lose his job at Fox News if the allegation became public.</p><p>Karoun Demirjian<!-- -->, <!-- -->Catie Edmondson<!-- --> and <!-- -->Sharon LaFraniere<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
