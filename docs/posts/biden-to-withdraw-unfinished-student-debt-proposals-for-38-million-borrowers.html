But it is also a strategy to make sure the next administration cannot rewrite or abandon the proposals in court, which could doom them legally for many years to come.</p><p>The pending regulations were essentially a Plan B after <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Supreme Court ruled last year</a> that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority with its plan to wipe out more than $400 billion in student debt.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/us/politics/biden-student-debt-plan-explained.html" title="">more expansive plan</a> of the two, proposed in April, would have given the education secretary broad discretion to cancel student loan balances in cases where interest on borrowers’ loans had ballooned over time, or where borrowers had been paying regularly for more than 20 years without reaching an end. The administration had estimated that nearly 30 million people could have qualified for relief under the regulation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/student-loan-debt-hardship-biden.html" title="">other proposal</a>, put forward in October, would have extended forgiveness to borrowers with a demonstrated financial hardship that made paying off their student debt unfeasible.</p><p>In <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-30606.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twin</a> <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-30605.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notices</a> posted to the Federal Register, the Education Department said it was not withdrawing the rules “based upon a changed view of the secretary’s authority,” but had decided to focus on supporting borrowers still struggling to make payments after the pandemic.</p><p>“The department at this time intends to commit its limited operational resources to helping at-risk borrowers return to repayment successfully,” the notices stated.</p><p>Since the rules were proposed, a number of legal experts have said the legal reasoning underpinning them was risky, especially after the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023, which expressed deep skepticism about the powers the Higher Education Act of 1965 gives the education secretary to cancel loans.</p><p>While the administration has maintained its view that the law grants that authority, the question was never tested in court. And if the rules were challenged by Republican state attorneys general next year, as many other planks of President Biden’s student debt policy have been, the Trump administration appears disinclined to defend them, potentially barring them from being tried again in the future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A spokesman for the White House did not immediately comment on the reasons behind the decision.</p><p>As it prepared to withdraw the regulations, the Biden administration instead focused on its success in other areas on Friday, announcing the approval of roughly 55,000 applications for loan forgiveness through the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/business/trump-public-service-loan-forgiveness.html" title="">Public Service Loan Forgiveness program</a>, totaling $4.28 billion. The approval brought the total number of people who have had their debt canceled under Mr. Biden to just shy of five million.</p><p>“Because of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt,” Mr. Biden said in a statement accompanying the announcement.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
