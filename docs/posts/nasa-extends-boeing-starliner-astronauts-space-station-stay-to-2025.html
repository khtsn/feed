They will return instead on a SpaceX capsule next year.</p><p>That decision finally brings clarity to the saga of the two NASA astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who docked at the space station as part of a test flight of the Boeing vehicle. It also extends months of difficult problems experienced by Boeing, a dominant aerospace company that has faced embarrassing setbacks in its much larger civilian aviation and defense divisions this year.</p><p>“A test flight by nature is neither safe nor routine,” Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, said during a news conference, “and so the decision to keep Butch and Suni aboard the International Space Station and bring the Boeing Starliner home uncrewed is a result of a commitment to safety.”</p></div></div><div><div><blockquote data-cards=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#34;NASA has decided that Butch and Suni will return with Crew-9 next February.&#34;<a href="https://twitter.com/SenBillNelson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SenBillNelson</a> and agency experts are discussing today&#39;s decision on NASA&#39;s Boeing Crew Flight Test.

</div></div><div><p>Norman Knight, the chief of NASA’s flight director office, said he had talked to the astronauts, Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore, and that they backed the extended stay in orbit.</p></div><div><div><p>“They support the agency’s decision fully, and they’re ready to continue this mission onboard I.S.S.,” Mr. Knight said.</p><p>But a longer sojourn in space means Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore will remain separated from their friends and families as the seasons change from summer to fall and then winter. Holidays and other occasions on Earth will be missed.</p><p>Part of the life of an astronaut is that the timing of a mission can change on short notice. Sometimes launches are delayed. Sometimes stays in space are extended.</p><p>“There’s always a possibility that they could be up there much longer than they anticipate,” Mr. Knight said. “So the families understand that. I’m not saying it’s not hard. It is hard.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The members of the Starliner crew were supposed to have stayed at the I.S.S. for as little as eight days. Problems almost inevitably pop up during test flights. This test flight was the first with people aboard the Starliner spacecraft, so it was not a surprise that their stay stretched out a couple of weeks.</p><p>But even after lengthy analysis and ground testing, engineers still could not say with certainty why several of Starliner’s thrusters had malfunctioned before the capsule and the astronauts docked with the space station in June.</p><p>“That risk was due to the uncertainties, due to the inability to predict with certainty that thruster performance for the rest of the mission,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program.</p><p>For the flight back, the key maneuver is an engine burn by larger thrusters that leads to the spacecraft dropping out of orbit. The smaller thrusters, including the ones that malfunctioned earlier, are used to keep the spacecraft pointed in the correct direction.</p><p>Analysis of the data showed that the firing of the larger thrusters also heated up the smaller thrusters, potentially causing more problems.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“These clusters have experienced more stress, more heating,” Mr. Stich said, “and so there’s a little bit more concern for how they would perform during the deorbit burn, holding the orientation of the vehicle, and then also the maneuvers required after that.”</p><p>That lingering uncertainty spurred unease and led NASA leaders to decide they should not risk the lives of Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore on Starliner. Instead they elected to rely on a different spacecraft — the Crew Dragon, built by SpaceX, a company founded by Elon Musk — for the return trip.</p><p>“The polling was unanimous amongst all the NASA folks,” said Ken Bowersox, the associate administrator for NASA’s space operations mission directorate.</p><p>Mr. Bowersox and Mr. Stich conceded that Boeing engineers and officials had disagreed about the risk. Boeing thought it had demonstrated that Starliner was safe enough for Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore to return home on.</p><p>“I would say that we’ve had a lot of tense discussions,” Mr. Bowersox said.</p><p>No one from Boeing took part in the news conference, but Mark Nappi, the Boeing official in charge of the Starliner program at Boeing, told his team in an email, “I know this is not the decision we had hoped for, but we stand ready to carry out the actions necessary to support NASA’s decision. The focus remains first and foremost on ensuring the safety of the crew and spacecraft.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Starliner will undock and return to Earth in early September without anyone aboard. The next launch of a SpaceX Crew Dragon is scheduled for no earlier than Sept. 24.</p><p>It will carry only two astronauts instead of the full crew of four that had already been assigned to a six-month mission at the space station. NASA officials said they were not ready to announce which two crew members would be bumped off that launch.</p><p>That will leave two seats for Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore, who will remain in orbit and become full-fledged members of the space station crew. That will extend their stay at the space station to eight months.</p><p>The four astronauts — Ms. Williams, Mr. Wilmore and the two astronauts launching on Crew Dragon in September — are to return to Earth around February.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-aeronautics-and-space-administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/24/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronauts.html">31</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/24/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronauts.html">31</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What’s Up in Space and Astronomy</h2><h3>Keep track of things going on in our solar system and all around the universe.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/science/space-astronomy-events-2024.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-space&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">2024 event</a> that’s out of this world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2024/01/01/science/astronomy-space-calendar?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-space&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">our space and astronomy calendar</a>.</p></li><li><p>A so-called hypervelocity object, which is either a low-mass star or a brown dwarf, is traveling through the Milky Way at around a million miles an hour.
