After the election, regardless of the outcome, they open up their wallets and shop again.</p><p>It’s the election shopping slump.</p><p>As the presidential election draws near, my colleague Jordyn Holman and I wanted to see if the trend was holding true this year as well. In a new article that published this morning, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/realestate/election-anxiety-home-car-sales.html" title="">we find that it is</a>.</p><p>Wedding planners told us that newly engaged couples were too distracted to book events for next year. Financial advisers said their clients were keeping their assets in cash. Car dealers said shoppers were staying on the sidelines.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain what drives this behavior, and why it’s not unique to this election cycle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2c87974b">The pivot point</h2><p>There are a lot of reasons Americans are reluctant to buy homes right now. Inflation drove mortgage interest rates to a 20-year high, and a lack of housing stock kept prices from falling, exacerbating an affordability crisis. But even in years when the housing market was more amenable, buyers got nervous before they went to the polls.</p><p>Jonathan Miller, a real estate appraiser, looked back at two decades of home sales in Los Angeles, Manhattan and Miami and saw a pattern: Sales dipped in the second half of even years and bounced back in odd years. “Election Day is the pivot point,” he said. “It’s like the foot is taken off the brake after the election.”</p><p>The dip isn’t dramatic, but it is consistent. In even years, sales fell by 5.5 percent in Los Angeles, 2.5 percent in Manhattan and 2.6 percent in Miami. In odd years, sales rose by 4.6 percent in Los Angeles, 8.5 percent in Manhattan and 10.2 percent in Miami. The pattern was not restricted to Democratic strongholds, either — it held in Suffolk County, N. Y., which typically votes for Republican candidates.</p><p>In conversations with car dealers, I heard of a similar pre-election pullback. Jerry Reynolds, a former car dealer and host of the “CarPro” radio show, told me this anxiety sets in every four years, only to evaporate after the election. He expects dealers “will see a surge of sales right after the election.”</p><p>Even armchair shoppers get cold feet. Big news moments often distract viewers of the television shopping networks QVC and HSN, according to David Rawlinson II, the chief executive of Qurate Retail Group, which owns the channels. “We rely on people watching our content,” he said, and when the news takes a dramatic turn, “they’re probably not watching QVC.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-49bba553">What’s driving this?</h2><p>Consumers don’t like uncertainty, and elections are all about the unknown. This one appears to be particularly close, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump locked in a virtual tie in the polls.</p><p>Cash is a resource — and for most of us, it’s the most fungible one we have. If we’re feeling as if we’re on unsolid ground, it’s no surprise that we would be reluctant to part with it. Kelly Goldsmith, a behavioral scientist and marketing professor at Vanderbilt University, studies the psychology of uncertainty and scarcity. She put it this way: “If the world starts to fall apart, you benefit from having a bunch of money in your mattress, right?”</p><p>There’s also the matter of the economy. Surveys have found that many Americans name it as their No. 1 concern this election, even though inflation has slowed and the job market is strong.</p><p>Some consumers are hoping that a Harris victory delivers down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers, one of her central campaign promises. Others hope that a second Trump administration improves the economy with tax cuts and spending cuts.</p><h2 id="link-401d26e7">Little luxuries persist</h2><p>Certainly Americans still shop when an election is coming. U.S. retail sales continued to grow last month. Consumer Edge, a company that tracks consumer data, looked at credit card and debit card transactions in the months leading up to the 2016, 2018 and 2022 elections and did not see any signs of an election season dip. (The company omitted 2020 because of the volatility caused by the pandemic.) But there was an exception to the trend: Bookings for cruises and purchases from luxury merchants slowed in the months before the 2016 election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Dr. Goldsmith said she wouldn’t be surprised if people spent more on small luxuries as they look for ways to feel in control of their world, even if it’s only an illusion. “When I see myself holding this $8 Starbucks cup, I feel like I’m a person able to do things in the universe,” she said.</p><p><strong>For more:</strong> Jordyn and I also spoke with reluctant consumers about their election angst. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/realestate/election-anxiety-home-car-sales.html" title="">You can read our full article here</a>.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-24f4bb57">More on the Election</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Political mail in Michigan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nic Antaya for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/door-knocks-texts-and-ads-ads-ads-life-on-the-swing-state-battlefield.html" title="">For swing-state voters</a>, life has become a barrage of television ads, dinner-hour phone calls, door-knocks and candidate visits. “My remote has a really strong mute button,” one Nevada resident said.</p></li><li><p>In Michigan — home to Flint and the birthplace of General Motors — trade policies and the water crisis loom large in the election. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/19/us/elections/flint-michigan-voters.html" title="">Hear from voters there</a>.</p></li><li><p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/trump-vulgarity-pennsylvania-rally.html" title="">made crude remarks</a> at a Pennsylvania rally, including about the size of a famous golfer’s genitals.</p></li><li><p>For critics, Trump’s meandering speeches raise questions about his age and his cognitive health.

Presley, the only child of Priscilla and Elvis Presley, died before she finished writing her life story. She’d prepared for the project and cogitated about it but, her daughter Riley Keough writes in the preface, “She wasn’t really sure what her value to the public was other than being Elvis’s daughter. She was so wracked with self-criticism that working on the book became incredibly difficult for her.” Keough picked up where Presley left off, using tapes her mother had made and chiming in with her own reflections — about Presley’s marriages, her struggle with addiction, her complicated relationship with her own mother and her unflagging devotion to Elvis, who died when she was 9. The result, now No. 2 on the best-seller list, is a family story with celebrity cameos, not the other way around. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/books/review/from-here-to-the-great-unknown-lisa-marie-presley-riley-keough.html" title="">Read our review here</a>.</p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>“When you’re in the spotlight, people tend to speak for you,” Alex Van Halen writes of his rocker brother, Eddie, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/arts/music/alex-van-halen-eddie-van-halen-brothers-book.html" title="">in a new memoir</a>. “I wanted to remind people that Ed was not a commodity.

But I haven’t seen you talk about what you think your brand </strong><strong><em>was</em></strong><strong>. Can you fill that in for me?</strong></p><p>My brand at the beginning wasn’t something that was much in my control. I entered the adult industry in October of 2014, and very quickly I was pressured to perform in a video where the context was that I was an Arab veiled woman. Not long after, I would say maybe a couple hours after it premiered, the avalanche started. Every news outlet picked it up. I was completely out of control of my image, my reputation. I feel like a lot of people have slutty phases when they’re 20, 21. Unfortunately, mine was in 4K.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>You’ll post a playful food video on TikTok and then a strident set of tweets about Gaza.

It’s <em>absolutely</em> chaos.</p><p><strong>You’ve been open online about having surgery to augment your appearance and being on Ozempic. Do the choices to do those things feel as if they’re coming from a place of agency and bodily autonomy? Is there any internal conflict there?</strong></p><p>Not at all, and the reason that I talk about it is because I like showing the dichotomy behind changing yourself. When I got my rhinoplasty, I needed to make a point of making sure that my nose stays ethnic. It’s about improving what you want to improve. Same with my breast augmentation. And then Ozempic, honestly, was such a big trend, and I wanted to try it. I started to speak openly about that because I was getting a lot of compliments about how good I looked and my “workout routine,” and I felt guilty perpetuating something that wasn’t real.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo illustration by Bobby Doherty</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armando Rafael for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>New York Times Cooking has been rhapsodizing about fall lately, but, for some, it may not be sweater season quite yet.
