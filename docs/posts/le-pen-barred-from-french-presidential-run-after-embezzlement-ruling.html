    <h1>Le Pen Barred From French Presidential Run After Embezzlement Ruling</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The court also sentenced Ms. Le Pen, 56, to four years in prison, with two of those years suspended, and a fine of 100,000 euros, or about $108,000. She has long denied any wrongdoing in the case, which involved accusations that her party, the National Rally, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/le-pen-eu-france-embezzlement-trial.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">illegally used several million euros</a> in European Parliament funds for expenses between 2004 and 2016.</p><p>She is widely expected to appeal the verdict, which would put most of her sentence on hold, but not the ban on running for public office. The court ruled that her electoral ineligibility is effective immediately. As a result, only a successful appeal before the 2027 deadline to enter the race would allow her to run.</p><p>That is not impossible, but it will be difficult. The appeals process is slow in France, and even if a new trial took take place before the 2027 election, it is unclear whether the prosecution’s case would be overturned.</p><p>Some politicians, even those opposed to Ms. Le Pen, have expressed fears that barring her from competing in the presidential race, despite her party’s popularity, could fuel a democratic crisis. The ruling does nothing to prevent her protégé, Jordan Bardella, 29, from running.</p><p>The verdict could usher in a period of renewed political turmoil if Ms. Le Pen decides to lash out against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/europe/france-government-no-confidence-vote.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">France’s fragile government</a> or if anger spills over into the streets. The government struggled to pass a budget this year and could still be toppled at any time by lawmakers in the lower house, where Ms. Le Pen’s party is the single largest.</p></div></div>
