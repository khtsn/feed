    <h1>With al-Assad Gone, Syrians Search Prisons for Traces of Their Loved Ones</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Her brother was pulled from his car at a military checkpoint nearly a decade ago, her brother-in-law dragged from his house by the police. Two of her cousins were arrested near the airport in the Syrian capital, Damascus. She said she never had heard from any of them again.</p><p>So after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus" title="">fall of President Bashar al-Assad</a> on Sunday, Ghusun Juma, 35, began a quest for answers that led her to an underground prison in one of Syria’s most notorious detention centers, a drab collection of buildings in southeastern Damascus.</p><p>“I am looking to see if there is anything that belonged to my brother, his ID card, or something with his name on it,” she said, guiding herself through a dark, dank cell block with a cellphone flashlight. “I have been looking since the first day, but I haven’t found anything anywhere.”</p><p>Mr. al-Assad’s ouster, and his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/syria-army-assad-fall.html" title="">troops’ abandonment of their bases</a> as rebels stormed through Damascus, has exposed the black boxes of one of the Arab world’s most repressive regimes. While some Syrians have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/assad-presidential-palace.html" title="">wandered through his luxurious palace</a>, many more have combed through the vast network of detention centers whose repression helped keep him in power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>An untold number of Syrians disappeared into the maw of that security apparatus over the decades. As the rebels broke into prisons and freed prisoners over the last few weeks, many Syrians hoped that their missing relatives would soon return home.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People searching a dilapidated concrete building with openings to small cells." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg/13Syria-Missing-dispatch-02-tqcg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/56c8e07b-4c35-5c46-a3dd-a8189cb41be2" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ghusun Juma, 35, right, searching underground cells at Branch 235, which was also known as Palestine Branch.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Identification documents were taken from detainees when they were imprisoned.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In Damascus, families have set out to look for their loved ones. All week, they have been driving around the city, asking at hospitals and clawing their way through dirty cells in now empty detention centers, hoping to find some trace of their relatives, alive or dead.</p><p>One of those notorious facilities — a security complex known as Branch 235, or Palestine Branch — was run by military intelligence in southeastern Damascus. The complex sits behind forbidding concrete blast walls on a main boulevard and contains nearly a dozen buildings, including offices and barracks for soldiers and officers, many of them just a few floors up from the prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2012, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/07/03/torture-archipelago/arbitrary-arrests-torture-and-enforced-disappearances-syrias" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch said</a> inmates there were regularly beaten, electrocuted and hung upside down. Three years later, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/12/16/if-dead-could-speak/mass-deaths-and-torture-syrias-detention-facilities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the group found</a> that conditions inside were so bad that prisoners often died from gastrointestinal infections, skin diseases, torture and starvation.</p><p>Now, the complex stands empty. Guarded by rebels, its buildings have been ransacked by looters or charred black and gray from fires.</p><p>During a visit this week, reporters from The New York Times found entire rooms packed with munitions — hand grenades, bullets, explosives and tear gas canisters — indicating a heavily armed force.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Empty ammunition crates at the Branch 235 complex.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inside the living quarters of prison staff.

They had low, concrete ceilings and no light source other than small holes in the heavy metal doors.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Graffiti on the wall of one cell included a bouquet of flowers and a pack of Hamra cigarettes, a Syrian brand. Drawings in another cell included large female eyes and a heart with an arrow piercing it.</p><p>The main prison, however, was on the two underground floors of an unimposing seven-story building nearby.</p><p>There, large cells once held many dozens of prisoners who shared a pit toilet with no door and most likely slept close together on the floor. Cockroaches ran across the walls, and the smell of sweaty bodies still hung in the air.</p><p>Other cells were smaller, likely for isolation. In a separate wing, women’s clothing was strewed across the floor next to tiny plastic sandals, indicating mothers jailed with their children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I was here, in this room!” screamed a veiled woman in a long black dress who was peering into a cell by the light of her cellphone flashlight. “This is where they put me for four and a half months.”</p><p>She said she had been locked in the small, windowless room in 2020 with dozens of other women. She did not say what she had been accused of.</p><p>“We slept on top of each other,” she said. “They did not feed us, they beat us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>For Hanaa, who gave only her first name out of an abiding fear of the regime, the prison held painful memories. “I was here, in this room!” she screamed as she peered into a cell. “This is where they put me for four and a half months.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Graffiti on a wall in the complex.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>She confirmed that children had been present, with mothers from Lebanon, Iraq and Chechnya whom the government had accused of terrorism.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Although Mr. al-Assad had fled Syria and his military and security forces had melted away as the rebels advanced on Damascus, she was still scared, and she gave only her first name, Hanaa.</p><p>“They will come back and kill us,” she said.</p><p>Many of the facility’s offices still contained voluminous paperwork, including investigation reports, case files, personnel lists and prisoner registries. Scattered in the mess left by looters who came after the guards fled and before the rebels took control were dozens of Syrian and Iraqi passports, ID cards and photos, probably of former inmates.</p><p>Rights groups hope that such paperwork will be preserved, potentially to serve as evidence in war crimes trials or to help families determine what became of their missing loved ones.</p><p>In an interview, Stephan Sakalian, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, said that since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, the committee had received more than 30,000 tracing requests from families looking for relatives.</p><p>Those included people arrested by the government and by armed groups as well as those who had disappeared at sea while trying to migrate to Europe, he said. Most of them had not been found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mohammed Kanaz, 62, looking for any trace of his son, who he said had been arrested at age 18 in 2012. “I raised him and loved him and he shined in my eyes,” Mr. Kanaz said. “What did he do?”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Belongings of former detainees in one of the cells.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Documents from prisons, hospitals and other institutions captured by rebels could provide critical clues to the fate of many of the missing, he said. But only if they are preserved.</p><p>“So far, no one has taken charge of the custody of these important documents,” Mr. Sakalian said. “Every single document could be the key to helping a family find someone who’s missing.”</p><p>In the prison’s lowest level, Mohammed Kanaz, 62, wept as he walked from cell to cell, looking for any trace of his son, Mohammed, who he said had been arrested at age 18 in 2012.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“I raised him and loved him and he shined in my eyes,” he said. “What did he do?”</p><p>Mr. Kanaz’s brother, too, had been arrested, at a military checkpoint in 2014, and the family was informed two years later that he had died in this prison.</p><p>“He died of a heart attack,” he said sarcastically, assuming the real cause of death had been mistreatment. “All the Syrian people died of heart attacks.”</p><p>But Mr. Kanaz had never received any information about his son.</p><p>In a large storeroom where prisoners had surrendered their belongings, he found a large registry with inmates’ names and their dates of admission.</p><p>“If he is dead, may God have mercy,” he said, flipping frantically through its pages to look for his son’s name. “If he is alive, where is he?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The complex now stands empty.
