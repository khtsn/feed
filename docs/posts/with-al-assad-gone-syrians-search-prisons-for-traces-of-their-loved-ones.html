The complex sits behind forbidding concrete blast walls on a main boulevard and contains nearly a dozen buildings, including offices and barracks for soldiers and officers, many of them just a few floors up from the prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2012, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/07/03/torture-archipelago/arbitrary-arrests-torture-and-enforced-disappearances-syrias" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch said</a> inmates there were regularly beaten, electrocuted and hung upside down.

Drawings in another cell included large female eyes and a heart with an arrow piercing it.</p><p>The main prison, however, was on the two underground floors of an unimposing seven-story building nearby.</p><p>There, large cells once held many dozens of prisoners who shared a pit toilet with no door and most likely slept close together on the floor. Cockroaches ran across the walls, and the smell of sweaty bodies still hung in the air.</p><p>Other cells were smaller, likely for isolation. In a separate wing, women’s clothing was strewed across the floor next to tiny plastic sandals, indicating mothers jailed with their children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I was here, in this room!” screamed a veiled woman in a long black dress who was peering into a cell by the light of her cellphone flashlight. “This is where they put me for four and a half months.”</p><p>She said she had been locked in the small, windowless room in 2020 with dozens of other women.

Scattered in the mess left by looters who came after the guards fled and before the rebels took control were dozens of Syrian and Iraqi passports, ID cards and photos, probably of former inmates.</p><p>Rights groups hope that such paperwork will be preserved, potentially to serve as evidence in war crimes trials or to help families determine what became of their missing loved ones.</p><p>In an interview, Stephan Sakalian, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, said that since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, the committee had received more than 30,000 tracing requests from families looking for relatives.</p><p>Those included people arrested by the government and by armed groups as well as those who had disappeared at sea while trying to migrate to Europe, he said.
