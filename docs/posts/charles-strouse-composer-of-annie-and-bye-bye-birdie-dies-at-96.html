His father was plagued by a range of serious health problems; his mother, chronically depressed, often threatened suicide and eventually spent more than two years in a psychiatric hospital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Put On a Happy Face” was the name of both one of Mr. Strouse’s best-known songs and his memoir, published in 2008.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Among the few truly happy times the Strouses enjoyed as a family, Mr. Strouse recalled in his 2008 memoir, “Put On a Happy Face,” were when they gathered around the piano to sing the latest popular standards as his mother played.</p><p>Years later, when it came time for Mr. Lear to devise the credit sequence for “All in the Family,” Mr. Strouse gave him the idea of having its stars, Carroll O’Connor and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/arts/television/jean-stapleton-who-played-archies-better-angel-dies-at-90.html" title="">Jean Stapleton</a>, seated at the piano in a similar tableau.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Strouse in 1986.

He majored in composition and earned a bachelor’s degree there in 1947.</p><p>“The direction of a melodic line, the stringency and resolution of a harmony — they were riddles to me that I wanted to spend my whole life solving,” Mr. Strouse wrote in his memoir.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Returning to Manhattan, he studied privately with Mr. Diamond and spent several summers working with Mr. Copland at Tanglewood. In 1950, he received a scholarship to study in Paris with Ms. Boulanger, whose students had included some of the most distinguished composers of the 20th century.</p><p>After he had worked with her for a time, Ms. Boulanger informed Mr. Strouse that he had a talent for light music. He was crushed, he recalled, until she told him that “to make someone forget illness and suffering is also a calling.”</p><p>It was as if, Mr. Strouse later wrote, she had been able to peer directly into his childhood home.</p><p>By that time, fate had already intervened in the person of Mr. Adams, whom Mr. Strouse had met at a party in late 1949. Although Mr. Strouse had little interest in musical theater then, the two made an offhand vow to collaborate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Adams, standing, with Mr. Strouse in 1972.

He also worked briefly for Fox Movietone News, writing background music for newsreels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>His first significant work as a composer of popular songs came in 1952, when he joined Mr. Adams at Green Mansions, a summer resort in the Adirondacks. The resort was famed for its Saturday-night revues, for which Mr. Strouse and Mr. Adams wrote original songs.</p><p>“Suddenly,” Mr. Strouse recalled, “people were walking out of the theater humming my tunes.”</p><p>The number that became “Put On a Happy Face” had its origins in one of their Green Mansions shows.</p><p>In the coming years, the pair contributed songs to several well-received Off Broadway revues, including “The Littlest Revue,” which opened in 1956 and starred <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/obituaries/charlotte-rae-dead.html" title="">Charlotte Rae</a>, Joel Grey and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/theater/tammy-grimes-died.html" title="">Tammy Grimes</a>.</p><p>Then, in the late 1950s, along came “Birdie.”</p><p>To hear Mr. Strouse tell it, the show’s premise was preposterous. Originally titled “Let’s Go Steady,” it centered on teenagers — not the leather-jacketed urban toughs that since 1957 had been tearing up Broadway in “West Side Story,” but pubescents of the poodle-skirted type, cut from clean, anodyne Middle American cloth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dick Gautier played Conrad Birdie, a very Elvis Presley-like rock ‘n’ roll star, in “Bye Bye Birdie” (1960), Mr. Strouse’s first Broadway show.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Photofest</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Based on the recent history of Elvis Presley, lately United States Army Private 53310761, the proposed musical followed the fortunes of a fictional pop star, Conrad Birdie — a play on the name of the country singer Conway Twitty, himself a rock ‘n’ roll star at the time — and his legions of adoring fans as he decamped for service.</p><p>The show hoped to capitalize on the current craze for rock ’n’ roll. But by his own admission, Mr. Strouse knew little of rock ’n’ roll and cared for it even less.</p><p>To make matters worse, the cast featured a bevy of relative unknowns, among them the nightclub singer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/arts/television/dick-gautier-who-played-a-rock-star-in-bye-bye-birdie-is-dead.html" title="">Dick Gautier</a> as Conrad and, as Conrad’s manager, a little-heralded actor named Dick Van Dyke.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Dubious but also impecunious, Mr. Strouse and Mr. Adams signed on. Over the next two years, while the fledgling “Birdie” was making the rounds of backers’ auditions, Mr. Strouse worked as an assistant to Frank Loesser, the titan who had written music and lyrics for “Guys and Dolls,” among other hits.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“Bye Bye Birdie” opened on Broadway on April 14, 1960. When someone read him <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/04/15/99730955.html?pageNumber=13" title="">the review by Brooks Atkinson</a> in The New York Times the next day, Mr. Strouse fainted. It was not from joy.</p><p>“As a production,” Mr. Atkinson had written, “‘Bye Bye Birdie’ is neither fish, fowl nor good musical comedy.”</p><p>Mercifully, other New York papers (the city was then glorious home to seven English-language dailies) were kinder. The show ran for 607 performances — a more-than-respectable tally at the time.</p><p>Mr. Strouse would outdo that figure with “Applause”: That show, which had a book by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and starred Len Cariou, Penny Fuller and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/arts/television/bonnie-franklin-actress-dies-at-69.html" title="">Bonnie Franklin</a> in support of Ms. Bacall, ran for 896 performances. He outdid “Applause” with “Annie,” written by Thomas Meehan, based on the venerable comic strip “Little Orphan Annie” and starring Andrea McArdle in the title role and Dorothy Loudon as her nemesis, Miss Hannigan; it ran for 2,377.</p><p>Not all of Mr. Strouse’s ventures were successful. “Bring Back Birdie,” a 1981 sequel, closed on Broadway after four performances. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/16/theater/troubled-annie-2-closing-out-of-town-revisions-planned.html" title="">Two “Annie” sequels</a>, “Annie 2: Miss Hannigan’s Revenge” and “Annie Warbucks,” closed out of town before reaching Broadway. The 1991 musical “Nick &amp; Nora,” with a book by Arthur Laurents, lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr. and a cast featuring Barry Bostwick and Joanna Gleason as Dashiell Hammett’s detectives Nick and Nora Charles, played just nine Broadway performances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Such are the vagaries of Broadway that even when Mr. Strouse’s music was critically praised, it was not always enough to sustain a show. That was the case with “Rags,” his 1986 musical about Jewish immigrants in early-20th-century New York, with a book by Joseph Stein and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz. Starring the operatic soprano Teresa Stratas, it closed after four performances.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Rags,” Mr. Strouse’s 1986 collaboration with Stephen Schwartz and Joseph Stein, closed after four performances. “The ‘Rags’ that might have been,” Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, “is best heard in Mr. Strouse’s score.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photofest</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>“The ‘Rags’ that might have been,” Frank Rich lamented in his review in The Times, “is best heard in Mr. Strouse’s score.”</p><p>Mr. Strouse’s honors included a Grammy Award for the “Annie” cast album; an Emmy, with Mr. Adams, for a 1995 television production of “Bye Bye Birdie” starring Jason Alexander; and the Richard Rodgers Award for lifetime achievement from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.</p><p>He was the founder, in 1979, of the ASCAP Musical Theater Workshop, which trains aspiring composers and lyricists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Mr. Strouse’s survivors include his children, Benjamin, Nicholas, Victoria and William Strouse, as well as eight grandchildren. His wife, Barbara Siman, a choreographer, died in 2023 after 61 years of marriage.</p><p>Throughout his long, successful career, Mr. Strouse never lost sight of the myriad anxieties that attend his calling. He was perhaps never more keenly aware of them than in March 1960, when “Bye Bye Birdie” opened in Philadelphia for its pre-Broadway tryout.</p><p>As the curtain rose, Mr. Strouse, Mr. Adams and Michael Stewart, who wrote the book, paced the lobby of the theater like expectant fathers. When the curtain rang down, to what Mr. Strouse considered “minimal applause,” he could bear it no longer.</p><p>He made for a broom closet under the lobby’s grand staircase.</p><p>“I was so nervous I went to hide,” Mr. Strouse told The Times in 2009. “I opened the door and heard a growl. It was Mike. He was already in there.”</p><p>Ash Wu<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Margalit Fox is a former senior writer on the obituaries desk at The Times.
