Mr. Mangione also faces weapons charges.</p><p>The hearing on Monday will be the first opportunity that Mr. Mangione and his lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, will have to formally respond to accusations leveled by the Manhattan district attorney’s office.</p><p>In addition, in a parallel case, federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed murder charges against Mr. Mangione on Thursday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/nyregion/luigi-mangione-federal-charges.html" title="">He has pleaded not guilty</a> to those charges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The killing, in the early hours of Dec. 4, gave rise to a debate about the frustrations that Americans have with the health insurance industry — the high costs, the denials of coverage and what many say is the industry’s prioritization of profits.</p><p>Mr. Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare, was walking that morning toward the entrance of a Hilton hotel on West 54th Street when a masked and hooded gunman opened fire behind him. Mr. Thompson, who was headed for an investor meeting, was shot once in the back and once in the leg.</p><p>Authorities have said that it was Mr. Mangione who waited nearly an hour outside the hotel that morning, armed with a 3-D-printed 9-millimeter handgun fitted with a suppressor. And as Mr. Thompson walked by, Mr. Mangione raised the weapon and fired, the police said.</p><p>Days later, Mr. Mangione was eating hash browns at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pa., when a fellow customer remarked to a friend that he resembled a person in photos released by the New York Police Department. An employee, who overheard the conversation, alerted the local police and Mr. Mangione was arrested.</p><p>Officers found a handgun, ammunition and fake identification cards on him, as well as a 262-word handwritten manifesto in which he appeared to take responsibility for the killing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Prosecutors in Manhattan, led by District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, have said that Mr. Mangione meant to terrorize civilians.</p><p>“This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation,” Mr. Bragg said at a news conference.</p><p>Ms. Friedman Agnifilo, Mr. Mangione’s lawyer, has called the parallel prosecutions a confusing and “highly unusual situation.” In federal court on Thursday, she voiced her frustration, saying that she had been prepared to defend her client that day in state proceedings.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Suspect in Killing of C.E.O.
