But it says the signatories are broadly concerned with the leadership of The Post.</p><p>“We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent,” the letter says.</p><p>A spokeswoman for The Washington Post declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Bezos, who owns The Post, did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The letter, which was reported earlier by NPR, said that the concerns were unrelated to Mr. Bezos’ recent decision to end its endorsement of presidential candidates, which the signatories recognized as “the owner’s prerogative.”</p><p>Instead, according to the letter, the concerns are about “retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost and re-establishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication.”</p><p>The company’s chief executive, Will Lewis, has been the focus of widening discontent at The Post for months. The newsroom’s top editor, Sally Buzbee, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/business/media/washington-post-buzbee-lewis.html" title="">stepped down</a> in June after he decided to reorganize the newsroom. Mr. Lewis’s choice to replace her, Robert Winnett, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/business/media/washington-post-editor-winnett.html" title="">withdrew</a> from consideration after a staff backlash. Several members of the The Post’s opinion staff resigned from the editorial board after the decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/business/media/washington-post-president-endorsement.html" title="">end presidential endorsements</a>, and The Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/business/media/washington-post-cartoonist-quits-after-jeff-bezos-cartoon-is-killed.html" title="">quit</a> after a cartoon that depicted Mr. Bezos genuflecting toward a statue of President-elect Donald J. Trump was killed. The Post has also seen a significant loss in subscriptions.</p><p>In the past several weeks, several reporters, including the political reporters Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/business/media/atlantic-politics-parker-scherer.html" title="">left</a> or are leaving for publications including The Atlantic and The Wall Street Journal. Others left for The New York Times, including Tyler Pager, who is joining as a White House reporter, and Matea Gold, who is a senior editor in The Times Washington bureau.</p><p>The letter concludes by asking Mr. Bezos to visit The Post’s offices to meet with the newspaper’s staff. He made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/business/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post.html" title="">a similar trip</a> in 2023, amid widespread discontent with Fred Ryan, the former publisher of The Post. Mr. Ryan stepped down later that year.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
