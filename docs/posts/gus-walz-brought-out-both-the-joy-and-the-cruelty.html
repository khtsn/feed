    <h1>Gus Walz Brought Out Both the Joy and the Cruelty</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gus Walz’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/style/gus-walz-dnc-social-media.html" title="">unbridled emotional reaction</a> last week at the Democratic National Convention to the nomination of his father, Gov. Tim Walz, embodied both the humanity that lies beneath the political process and the momentousness of the political process itself.</p><p>In other words, Gus reacted the way he did because he recognized the import of his father’s nomination. And because the man onstage was his father — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBrnKM0jo40" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“That’s my dad!”</a> — a man who raised and <a href="https://people.com/gus-walz-learning-disorder-secret-power-exclusive-8691793" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported and accepted</a> and loved him for who he is, a 17-year-old boy with anxiety and a learning disorder and, as Tina Brown wrote in her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/tim-walz-son-gus.html" title="">gorgeous essay</a> on Friday, a human being like any other.</p><p>Gus’s reaction was beautiful. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/democratic-convention-tim-walz-son-emotions-criticized-backlash" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">then things got ugly</a>.</p><p>In response to Gus’s exuberance, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ann-coulter-roast-goes-viral-as-internet-gets-revenge-for-gus-walz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ann Coulter posted</a> on X, “Talk about weird …” (She later took her post down.) “Sorry, but this is embarrassing for both father and son,” the conservative radio host Jay Weber posted. “If the Walzs represent today’s American man, this country is screwed,” he said, adding a crude insult of the teenage Walz. (He, too, removed his post.)</p><p>Perhaps they didn’t know the context. They didn’t know anything about Gus Walz beyond the politics of his father. They didn’t realize they should have been kind. Few people do before issuing a least-charitable-interpretation potshot. People’s private lives, their psychological state, their family or personal circumstances and their disabilities are often invisible. This is as true for public figures as it is for private citizens. Gus didn’t deserve “special” treatment — he deserved the kind of treatment any person does.</p></div></div>
