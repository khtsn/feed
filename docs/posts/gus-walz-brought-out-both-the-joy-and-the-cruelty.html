Tim Walz, embodied both the humanity that lies beneath the political process and the momentousness of the political process itself.</p><p>In other words, Gus reacted the way he did because he recognized the import of his father’s nomination. And because the man onstage was his father — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBrnKM0jo40" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“That’s my dad!”</a> — a man who raised and <a href="https://people.com/gus-walz-learning-disorder-secret-power-exclusive-8691793" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported and accepted</a> and loved him for who he is, a 17-year-old boy with anxiety and a learning disorder and, as Tina Brown wrote in her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/tim-walz-son-gus.html" title="">gorgeous essay</a> on Friday, a human being like any other.</p><p>Gus’s reaction was beautiful. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/democratic-convention-tim-walz-son-emotions-criticized-backlash" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">then things got ugly</a>.</p><p>In response to Gus’s exuberance, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ann-coulter-roast-goes-viral-as-internet-gets-revenge-for-gus-walz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ann Coulter posted</a> on X, “Talk about weird …” (She later took her post down.) “Sorry, but this is embarrassing for both father and son,” the conservative radio host Jay Weber posted. “If the Walzs represent today’s American man, this country is screwed,” he said, adding a crude insult of the teenage Walz. (He, too, removed his post.)</p><p>Perhaps they didn’t know the context. They didn’t know anything about Gus Walz beyond the politics of his father. They didn’t realize they should have been kind. Few people do before issuing a least-charitable-interpretation potshot. People’s private lives, their psychological state, their family or personal circumstances and their disabilities are often invisible. This is as true for public figures as it is for private citizens. Gus didn’t deserve “special” treatment — he deserved the kind of treatment any person does.</p></div></div><div><div><p>If nothing else, Gus reminds us of what an unfiltered human reaction looks like and what a sharp contrast it makes with the noxious swill of performance, hot takes and low blows that passes for online political commentary.</p><p>Let’s dwell on that contrast for a moment. Gus’s surge of emotion offered an image of us at our all-too-human best. Those who chose to disparage him reeked of our-all-too human worst. Gus Walz showed us what it means to really care about other people. His critics made clear they’ve forgotten how.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Pamela Paul is an Opinion columnist at The Times, writing about culture, politics, ideas and the way we live now. <span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
