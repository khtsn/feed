In fact, her high school classmates at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Conn., voted her “Most Likely to Be on a Reality Show.”</p><p>Which is why her appearance on season 26 of “The Bachelor,” which aired in 2022, did not surprise those closest to her.</p><p>Ms. Tookes, 29, was also drawn to a job that revolved around love and dating. After graduating from N.Y.U. Gallatin School of Individualized Study with a concentration in music and meaning in 2017, she worked as a people operations specialist for Hinge.</p><p>But, still, she felt “perpetually stuck.”</p><p>“I wasn’t feeling that inspired by my relationship, by my apartment, by anything,” said Ms. Tookes, who had moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, from her hometown, Stamford, Conn.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As she was entering her mid-20s, she was looking for an interesting, exciting experience. That turned out to be competing for the affection of one man on national television, with nearly 30 other women. Almost immediately, the experience was a big blow to her self esteem.</p><p>“I remember the first night, I was right back to where I was in high school, feeling not super confident,” Ms. Tookes said. “I didn’t think that I would get a rose. In hindsight, I didn’t even really have feelings for the person.” But when she didn’t get the immediate validation from first impressions, she couldn’t help but feel a bit insecure.</p><p>By the third episode of the show, she was sent home. She left knowing that she had a lot to learn about herself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peter Osadetz, a close friend of the couple, officiated in front of 120 guests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gillie Bird</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In the next year, the longtime country music fan rebranded herself as a “disco cowboy,” as she put it. “‘I need to stop caring about what people think about me and listen to country music openly, dress how I want,” she recalled thinking.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She said she felt a renewed sense of self — she was dating in Brooklyn, exploring the city with friends and meeting new people. She felt ready for another experience, and was recruited to join the cast of season 2 of “Bachelor in Paradise Canada,” a Canadian spinoff of “Bachelor in Paradise.”</p><p>There, she met Joey Blake Kirchner, whose involvement in the show was a bit more abrupt. Mr. Kirchner, who grew up in a small town called Redcliff in Alberta, Canada, was scouted to be a model at a mall when he was 15. He spent years in New York and Toronto, booking modeling and acting gigs. When the pandemic set in, he moved back to Alberta and worked in construction.</p><p>Producers of “Bachelor in Paradise” reached out to his agency in search of contestants. Mr. Kirchner, 34, didn’t know much about the “Bachelor” franchise. But, he said, he “knew it was a hell of a lot better than putting posts in the ground in minus 40-degree weather.” He sent in an audition tape and was cast for the first season of the show.</p><p>When he watched an episode, he thought to himself, “What did I get myself into? This is crazy. This is really cheesy.” Since he had already agreed, he thought he would make the most of it. “What do I have to lose?” he recalled thinking.</p><p>After appearing on the first season of the show, he learned he actually had a lot to lose: He fell hard for someone who he said was ultimately not a good match for him. When he was asked to return to the show for the second season, he immediately declined. But when they offered to increase his pay, he had a change of heart.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Deep down, did I think maybe there’s a chance of meeting someone? Maybe,” Mr. Kirchner said. “But I was much less inclined to be open to that happening this time around than I was the first time.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Tookes’s father, Darryl Tookes, escorted her down the aisle and later performed “Being Alive” by Stephen Sondheim and an original song titled “New England Morning” during the reception.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gillie Bird</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/vows" title=""><em>Binge more Vows columns here</em></a></strong><strong><em> and </em></strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/fashion/weddings" title=""><em>read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here</em></a></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>Leading up to the show, the couple said producers were telling each of them individually that they had the perfect match for them.</p><p>“I was like, ‘You said this before,’” Mr. Kirchner said. “‘I’m not letting you guys build this person up onto a pedestal.’” He was afraid of getting hurt again.</p><p>The producers were right, however, because when Ms. Tookes joined the show two weeks into filming, “everything changed,” Mr. Kirchner said.</p><p>When they first met in June 2022, Mr. Kirchner said he didn’t put his best foot forward. The result was a “surface-level” conversation, Ms. Tookes said. They talked about U.S. cities named after European ones, like Paris, Texas, and Athens, Ga.</p><p>Ms. Tookes, a new contestant on the show, received a “date card” and had to choose one person to take out on a date. (Unlike “The Bachelor,” “Bachelor in Paradise” revolves around multiple single men and women seeking relations with one another.) As she weighed her options, Mr. Kirchner wasn’t at the top of her list, but the production team encouraged her to pick him, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Before they were castmates, Ms. Tookes started her reality TV journey on season 26 of “The Bachelor.” Mr. Kirchner started modeling and acting as a teen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gillie Bird</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Their first date was on a helicopter. A cameraman sat so close to them in the confined space that he was touching their knees. Mr. Kircher, who is afraid of heights, said that Ms. Tookes’s “angelic, calming voice” brought him a sense of reassurance. During the conversation, he said they were “finally, really seeing each other for the first time.”</p><p>They had a “metaphysical conversation,” she said, and they even noticed that the cameraman had a smile on his face.</p><p>For the next couple of weeks, the two were inseparable. They brought the inner child out of each other and wrote haikus together.</p><p>“It was the first time where I felt 100 percent seen by someone and loved by someone,” Ms. Tookes said.</p><p>Despite how great things were going, Mr. Kirchner started getting cold feet toward the end of filming. Ms. Tookes caught on. She told him that even though she wanted to be with him, she would be OK regardless of what happened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I’m like, ‘She’s right. She’ll be totally fine without me,’” Mr. Kirchner said. That made him realize: “Well, I don’t want to be without you.”</p><p>“I felt like for the first time I was able to communicate my love for someone, but not in a way that diminished the size of myself,” Ms. Tookes said. “I was taking up space.” She felt empowered, and she proposed to him on-camera the following day by saying, “Will you go to the disco with me for the rest of our lives?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-16"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In addition to their wedding cake, the couple served an assortment of desserts.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gillie Bird</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guests dined on piri piri chicken, kalbi short ribs and vegetable tagine at the reception.<br/></span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gillie Bird</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Crying, Mr. Kirchner got down on one knee and proposed as well. He said he knew that getting engaged 13 days after meeting each other was outlandish — but he surrendered to the moment.</p><p>And although the two were aware of the sometimes highly contrived components of the show, which is par for the course in reality television, the relationship that emerged turned out to be very real.</p><p>When they left the fantasy land that is “Bachelor” production, the foundation of the relationship they had built on the show stayed intact (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/arts/television/bachelor-bachelorette-breakups-reality-tv.html" title="">which doesn’t always happen</a> for other couples from the franchise).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>For months, the two continued their relationship long distance. Mr. Kirchner lived in Drumheller, a town in Alberta best known for its collection of dinosaur fossils, and she lived in Brooklyn.</p><p>Ms. Tookes had given him a stuffed animal named Milkweed. Each day, after working long hours in construction, Mr. Kirchner took the blue velvet monster to a different dinosaur statue around town, sometimes placing it on the statue’s shoulders or head, snapping a picture and sending it to Ms. Tookes. It made her smile every time.</p><p>On Feb. 1, 2023, the couple moved into an apartment in Toronto. The following year, they moved to the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Now, Mr. Kirchner works as an actor, model and bartender. Ms. Tookes freelances in human resources and also models.</p><p>On Sept. 21, the couple was married at the Brighthouse Farm in Prince Edward, Ontario, in front of 120 guests. Peter Osadetz, a close friend of the couple and a lawyer who can legally notarize documents, officiated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As a nod to the couple’s time on “The Bachelor” franchise, all of their guests received a rose. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gillie Bird</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Mr. Kirchner wore a Ralph Lauren tuxedo, and Ms. Tookes wore a gown by Justin Alexander, a designer who she said made her feel comfortable during the dress shopping experience.

They also purchased décor, including a disco ball and lamps, that they kept for their apartment or gave to friends.
