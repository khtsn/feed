Footage from NHK, the public broadcaster, showed a blaze erupting at the test site in southwestern Japan.</p><p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, known as JAXA, said in a statement that there had been no reports of injuries or damage to the surrounding facilities. It was investigating he cause of the engine malfunction.</p><p>The failed test of JAXA’s Epsilon S rocket, codeveloped with Japanese heavy-industry manufacturer IHI, follows a similar issue in 2023 that led to months of reviews and delays. JAXA has previously said it planned to launch a demonstration model of the rocket by the end of March.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Japan’s bigger mainstay rocket, the H3, experienced several delays and a failed attempt before it was successfully launched into orbit earlier this year. The country’s first satellite launch attempted by a private company, the Tokyo-based startup Space One, failed after the rocket exploded shortly after liftoff in March.</p><p>Japan’s latest stumble comes amid a global surge in demand for satellites and the rockets needed to launch them into orbit. The market for satellite manufacturing and launch vehicles is expected to surpass $400 billion by the end of the decade, up from around $250 billion this year, according to Mordor Intelligence, a research and advisory firm.</p><p>Currently, the market for satellite launch vehicles is dominated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, along with other key players including United Launch Alliance, the joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin; France’s Arianespace; and Russia’s Roscosmos, according to the research firm.</p><p>JAXA has said that its Epsilon rockets provide a “world-class” environment for satellites, citing engineering advancements aimed at reducing vibrations and shocks during satellite separation. “Through these efforts, we intend to make a full-scale entry into the launch market,” JAXA said in an online post last year.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hisako Ueno is a reporter and researcher based in Tokyo, writing on Japanese politics, business, labor, gender and culture.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hisako-ueno">More about Hisako Ueno</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
