Iranians began to leave Syria on Friday morning, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Evacuations were ordered at the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, and at bases of the Revolutionary Guards, the Iranian and regional officials said. At least some of the embassy staff has departed.</p><p>Some are leaving by plane to Tehran, while others are leaving via land routes to Lebanon, Iraq and the Syrian port of Latakia, the officials said.</p><p>“Iran is starting to evacuate its forces and military personnel because we cannot fight as an advisory and support force if Syria’s army itself does not want to fight,” Mehdi Rahmati, a prominent Iranian analyst who advises officials on regional strategy, said in a telephone interview.</p><p>“The bottom line,” he added, “is that Iran has realized that it cannot manage the situation in Syria right now with any military operation and this option is off the table.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein and Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Bassam al-Sabbagh during a news conference in Baghdad on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmed Jalil/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Alongside Russia, Iran has been the Syrian government’s most powerful supporter, sending advisers and commanders to bases and the front lines and backing militias.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It also deployed tens of thousands of volunteer fighters, including Iranians, Afghans and Pakistani Shias, to defend the government and to retake territory from the Islamic State terrorist group at the height of Syria’s civil war. Some of Iran’s forces, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/world/middleeast/us-strike-afghans-iran.html" title="">like the Afghan Fatemiyoun brigade, had remained</a> in Syria at military bases operated by Iran; on Friday, they were also being transferred to Damascus and Latakia, an Assad government stronghold, the Iranian officials said. A video posted on accounts affiliated with the Guards showed the Fatemiyoun in uniform taking refuge at the shrine of Seyed Zainab near Damascus.</p><p>The surprise offensive by a rebel coalition has dramatically changed the landscape of the civil war, which Mr. al-Assad had fought to a standstill, and Iran’s control over some of Syria’s territory. In a little over a week, the rebels have swept through major cities like Aleppo and Hama, captured swaths of territory across four provinces, and moved toward Syria’s capital, Damascus.</p><p>The Iranian officials said that two top generals of Iran’s Quds forces, deployed to advise the Syrian army, had fled to Iraq as various rebel groups took over Homs and Deir al-Zour on Friday.</p><p>“Syria is at the verge of collapse and we are watching calmly,” <a href="https://x.com/Ahmadnaderi_ir/status/1865096403300548626" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Ahmad Naderi, an Iranian Parliament member, in</a> a post on social media on Friday. He added that if Damascus fell, Iran would also lose its sway in Iraq and Lebanon, saying, “I don’t understand the reason for this inaction but whatever it is, it’s not good for our country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The rebel offensive came at a moment of relative weakness for three of Syria’s most important supporters. Iran’s ability to help has been curtailed by its conflict with Israel; Russia&#39;s military has been sapped by its invasion of Ukraine; and Hezbollah, which had previously supplied fighters to aid the Assad government’s fight against the Islamic State, has been battered badly by its own war with Israel.</p><p>The fall of more territory to rebel forces, which are led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, could also threaten Iran’s ability to supply either Mr. al-Assad’s regime or Hezbollah with weapons and advisers.</p><p>Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, had traveled to Damascus this week, meeting with Mr. al-Assad and pledging Iran’s full support.</p><p>But in Baghdad on Friday, he appeared to make a more ambiguous statement. “We are not fortune tellers,” he said in an interview on Iraqi television. “Whatever is God’s will shall happen, but the resistance will fulfill its duty.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A picture shows a burned billboard bearing a portrait of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at central Aleppo’s Saadallah al Jabiri Square on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Farnaz Fassihi is the United Nations bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the organization, and also covers Iran and the shadow war between Iran and Israel.
