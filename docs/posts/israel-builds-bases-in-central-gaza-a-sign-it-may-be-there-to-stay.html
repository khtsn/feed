That has slowly grown into an 18-square-mile block of territory controlled by Israeli forces, according to the Israeli military and a New York Times analysis of satellite images and video footage.</p><p>Over the past three months, soldiers have demolished more than 600 buildings around the road in an apparent attempt to create a buffer zone. They have also rapidly expanded a network of outposts equipped with communications towers and defensive fortifications.</p><p>The buildup suggests a shift for Israel, which had largely avoided holding Gazan territory, creating a vacuum that has allowed Hamas to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza.html" title="">reassert control</a> in some parts of Gaza. The military said that the expansion was for operational reasons.</p><p>The expansion has also raised speculation about Israel’s plans for Gaza’s future. Israelis leaders have vowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-security-hamas.html" title="">maintain security control</a> in Gaza even after the war, without saying clearly what that might entail. Israeli military analysts say the increase in infrastructure along the Netzarim corridor might serve that purpose.</p><p>Control of the corridor, which cuts across Gaza from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea, has given Israel the ability to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/world/middleeast/gaza-war-cease-fire-israel.html" title="">regulate</a> travel across the length of the enclave, keeping hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in the south. In recent months, the Israeli military has extended its power over territory on either side of the corridor, roughly 4.3 miles wide and 4.3 miles long, to make it easier for Israeli forces to hold onto the area, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel captured and occupied Gaza in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, maintaining Jewish settlements and military bases there. The country withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005.</p><p>Some Israeli ministers have said that the military control in Gaza should pave the way for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers.html" title="">renewed Jewish settlement</a>, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has ruled that out for now. The former Israeli settlement of Netzarim — for which the military corridor is named — lies within the area now fully under Israeli control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/25/video/xxvi-netzarim-sign/xxvi-netzarim-sign-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/25/video/xxvi-netzarim-sign/xxvi-netzarim-sign-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/25/video/xxvi-netzarim-sign/xxvi-netzarim-sign-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A sign in Hebrew near dry tree branches and vehicles." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/25/video/xxvi-netzarim-sign/xxvi-netzarim-sign-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/25/video/xxvi-netzarim-sign/xxvi-netzarim-sign-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/25/video/xxvi-netzarim-sign/xxvi-netzarim-sign-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/25/video/xxvi-netzarim-sign/xxvi-netzarim-sign-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1170w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f3562c06-8627-54da-8865-1aa82e3285f9" decoding="async" width="600" height="590"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph posted to an Israeli combat engineer’s Instagram account showing a sign along the Netzarim corridor’s main road bearing the message “Drive safely — good luck.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">@gdud749/Instagram, via Younis Tirawi</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Times analysis of satellite images over the past three months shows that the Israeli military has at least 19 large bases throughout the area and dozens of small ones. While some were built earlier in the war, the imagery also shows that the pace of construction appears to be accelerating: Twelve of the bases were either built or expanded since early September.</p><p>Many are paved and walled off, with barracks, access roads and parking for armored vehicles. They are often surrounded by defensive ditches, mounds and obstacles to obstruct vehicles.</p><p>Colonel Shoshani said the expanded ground occupation was simply for operational reasons. “Anything that has been built there can be taken down within a day,” he said.</p><p>The extent of the fortifications suggest, however, that Israel is at the very least preparing for a protracted battle in Gaza. Avi Dichter, an Israeli government minister, said Israel was “going to stay in Gaza for a long time.”</p><p>“We are definitely not at the beginning of the end, because we still have a lot of work to do,” Mr. Dichter told reporters in Jerusalem.</p><p>Amir Avivi, a retired brigadier general who is regularly briefed by Israel’s security establishment, said many of the country’s military leaders now believed “withdrawing and separation are no longer options.”</p><p>“That’s why they’re building all of this,” said General Avivi, who leads a forum of hawkish former security officials. “At the end of the day, the facts speak for themselves.”</p><p>In November, Mr. Netanyahu toured the Netzarim corridor in a relatively rare visit to the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops in the area were “doing amazing work,” <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/event-netzarim191124" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the prime minister said</a> in a statement. “They have achieved excellent results toward our important objective — Hamas will not rule in Gaza,” he added.</p><p>The Biden administration has opposed long-term Israeli control in Gaza, which it hopes will become part of a future Palestinian state. President-elect Donald J. Trump has called on Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/us/politics/trump-israel-hamas-war.html" title="">to “finish up” the war</a>, without stipulating what terms he might deem acceptable for a postwar Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One of the largest Israeli bases, which is at the intersection of the Netzarim corridor and the main highway running north-south, has steadily expanded through the year. It now contains extensive infrastructure, such as two communications towers and a large checkpoint, according to satellite footage.</p><p>Israeli forces leveled at least 620 residential buildings, greenhouses and other structures from Sept. 3 to Nov. 21, according to the Times analysis. Israeli soldiers from the military’s 749th Combat Engineering Battalion posted videos on social media of demolitions that they had carried out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/multimedia/xxvi-oct10-vid-image/xxvi-oct10-vid-image-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/multimedia/xxvi-oct10-vid-image/xxvi-oct10-vid-image-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/11/17/129737_1_xxvi-oct10-vid_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A video filmed in early October, and uploaded to the 749th Combat Engineering Battalion’s Instagram account, shows at least three buildings being destroyed from controlled demolitions in southern Gaza City.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>@gdud749/Instagram, via Younis Tirawi</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Times verified 11 of the videos, which are filmed by drones and provide a bird’s-eye view of Israel’s efforts to remake the geography south of Gaza City. They were first published widely by Younis Tirawi, a Palestinian journalist who downloaded them from the soldiers’<span>  </span>social media accounts.</p><p>Asked why the military had demolished buildings, Colonel Shoshani said at least some had been used by Palestinians militants as lookout posts and hiding places. With much of the area flattened, Hamas fighters would now be less likely to sneak up on Israeli troops patrolling on the Netzarim corridor or on Israeli outposts, Israeli military analysts said.</p><p>Israeli soldiers began paving and fortifying the Netzarim corridor late last year, soon after the military’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-invasion-secrecy.html" title="">ground invasion of Gaza</a> began. Israel launched its campaign against Hamas in Gaza after the Hamas-led <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/issue/world/2024/10/21/the-oct-7-attacks" title="">Oct. 7, 2023, attacks</a>, in which the Israeli authorities say roughly 1,200 people in Israel were killed and 250 taken hostage. By June, most structures within a half-mile north and south of the road were gone, creating what the Israel military considered to be a buffer zone.</p><p>The Gazan village of Al Mughraqa, nearly four miles south of Gaza City, was the hardest hit during that period. More than 10,000 people lived in Al Mughraqa before the war, surrounded by fragrant lemon orchards and tilling fields of tomatoes and cucumbers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="xxgaza-netzarim-satellite" data-id="100000009832683" data-source-id="100000009832683"><div slug="xxgaza-netzarim-satellite" data-sourceid="100000009832683" id="embed-id-100000009832683">
