    <h1>Trump Spoke to Putin for Two Hours</h1>

But he also repeated his demand for broad concessions, suggesting that the call had failed to yield any major breakthroughs.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/world/europe/trump-putin-ukraine.html" title="">Trump offered a more optimistic take</a>. He said it “went very well,” and that Russia and Ukraine would “immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War.” </p><p>Trump presented the start of peace talks as a concession by Putin, but he was effectively endorsing Putin’s own approach, given that Russia has responded to calls to stop the fighting by proposing extended negotiations. </p><p>Both sides reported that Trump and Putin got along well. Trump wrote that “the tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent.” Putin’s foreign policy adviser told a state news agency that the leaders called each other by their first names and that “neither of them wanted to end the conversation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-12d383d9">Justices allowed Trump to lift protections for Venezuelans</h2><p>The Supreme Court issued a brief order this afternoon that allowed the Trump administration to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/supreme-court-protected-status-venezuelans.html" title="">remove deportation protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants</a>, pending appeal of the case. A lower court judge had previously blocked the move.</p><p>In the court’s order — which was unsigned and gave no reasoning, as is normal with emergency applications — the justices said that the administration could temporarily strip the immigrants of temporary legal status. That could potentially allow the U.S. to begin deporting them.</p><p>Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal justice, noted that she would have denied the government’s request. A lawyer representing the immigrants described the court’s decision as “truly shocking” and ”the largest single action stripping any group of noncitizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-1a9af2e0">Treatment for diagnoses like Biden’s have greatly advanced</h2><p>Experts say that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/health/joe-biden-diagnosis-prostate-cancer.html" title="">Joe Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis</a>, which his office announced yesterday, is serious.
