    <h1>Russia Frees American Prisoner Before Talks With U.S.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Wayne’s arrest came as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/marc-fogel-teacher-released-russia.html" title="">U.S. and Russian officials were making the final negotiations to free Marc Fogel</a>, an American teacher who was arrested in August 2021 on marijuana charges. Mr. Wayne’s detention complicated those talks and may have delayed Mr. Fogel’s release, at least by a few days, according to a person briefed on the talks.</p><p>In exchange for Mr. Fogel’s release, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/russia-us-prisoner-exchange-marc-fogel.html" title="">United States released Alexander Vinnik</a>, who was serving a sentence in connection with a cryptocurrency exchange that prosecutors said had been used to launder money.</p><p>But representatives of Mr. Wayne said he was not traded but released unconditionally, as Russian officials sought to remove any potential irritants with the Trump administration before talks on the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith, lawyers who represented Mr. Fogel, were asked to help with Mr. Wayne’s case not long after he was arrested. In a statement, they credited Mr. Trump’s recent diplomatic outreach with securing the release of both Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wayne.</p><p>“Under President Trump, we are witnessing a shift in diplomatic strategy — one that prioritizes American citizens and engages directly to resolve wrongful detentions with urgency and strength,” the statement said.</p></div></div>
