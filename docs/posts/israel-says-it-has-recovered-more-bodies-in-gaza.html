    <h1>Israel Says It Has Recovered More Bodies in Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Still, the news of the discovery accelerated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-protests.html" title="">an increasingly rancorous debate</a> within Israeli society about whether Israel should soften its position during negotiations with Hamas for a cease-fire. Under the terms currently being negotiated, scores of hostages would be released from captivity in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians detained in Israel.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is holding out for a deal in which the country would be able to retain control of strategic parts of Gaza during the cease-fire and restart the war in the future.</p><p>That position has angered Israelis who want their leaders to swiftly agree to a deal in order to accelerate the hostages’ release. For months, the families and supporters of the hostages have said that the prolonged negotiations had made it more likely that their relatives would be killed in captivity.</p><p>Minutes after the military’s announcement, an umbrella group representing the families of the hostages said in a statement: “Netanyahu abandoned the hostages! This is now a fact.” The statement also called on the public to prepare for new demonstrations starting as soon as Sunday.</p><p>More than 100 hostages were freed in an earlier cease-fire in November, while eight have been rescued alive during Israeli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/16/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-nuseirat.html" title="">rescue operations</a> that have cost the lives of scores of Palestinians. The bodies of several others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-bodies-recovered-gaza.html" title="">have also been found</a> and repatriated by the Israeli military. Three were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/world/middleeast/hostage-killings-israel-military.html" title="">shot and killed in December</a>, after waving a white flag, by Israeli soldiers.</p></div></div>
