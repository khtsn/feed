For decades, American firms have designed products in the United States and turned to Chinese factories to produce the goods efficiently and inexpensively. It is how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/business/apple-tariffs-jobs-investment.html" title="">Apple</a> produces iPhones, and how an entrepreneur like Ms. Campbell, a mother of three, operates a business that she said generates $2 million a year in sales from her kitchen.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/china-tariffs-callout-trump.html" title="">New York Times</a> has heard from nearly 100 companies that import from China about how the president’s tariffs were affecting them. They are a cross-section of striving enterprises stitched into the global economy: companies that make greeting cards, board games, outdoor footwear, hangers, digital picture frames, coffee equipment, toys, stained-glass windows and custom electronics.</p><p>Several themes emerged. American businesses, not Chinese suppliers, were shouldering the cost of tariffs. Many companies said they would have to raise prices to offset the expense if they had not already. Some spoke of a feeling of business paralysis: They were afraid to make plans amid the unpredictable stream of new tariffs, fearing the risk of moving production out of China since no country seemed immune.</p><p>Turning to domestic alternatives was usually not viable because they were more expensive, the quality was inferior and there were fewer options. Finally, completely reinventing their supply chain would be a huge undertaking for the companies, requiring time and expense they cannot easily spare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-5"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/28/multimedia/00TRUMP-TARIFFS-IMPACT-01-fvkt/00TRUMP-TARIFFS-IMPACT-01-fvkt-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span>David Degner for The New York Times</span></span></p><div><p>“The best machinery, the best expertise, the ability to produce quality goods at a good price is located in China,” Bill Keefe said.</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>At a minimum, business owners are facing a 10 percent cost increase in the goods that they bring in from China — whether components for items assembled in the United States or finished products made in Chinese facilities.

The status of both countries as important way stations for Chinese goods and the prospect of retaliation give small-business owners another thing to worry about. Starting March 12, there will be a 25 percent duty on imported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/china-trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html" title="">steel and aluminum</a> — two metals whose production China dominates. U.S. trade officials are proposing to impose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/business/trump-china-shipping.html" title="">fees on Chinese vessels</a> entering U.S. ports, potentially increasing shipping costs from China.</p><p>Mr. Trump has said the 10 percent tariff was “an opening salvo.” Last year on the campaign trail, he pledged a tariff of up to 60 percent.</p><p>Even at 10 percent, the tariff is a heavy blow to <a href="https://www.juliannarae.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor5UlKelmCVIYZSuxZyaMuDzSPuyyygWofjsf_zXIeJlyhq-7S0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Julianna Rae</a>, a company that sells high-end silk sleepwear, because all of its products are made in China. Based in Burlington, Mass., the company designs silk robes, pajamas and nightgowns that are produced in China. It imports the goods into the United States and sells them on its website and on Amazon.</p><p>The company’s proprietors, Bill Keefe and Juli Lee, said they were scrambling to deal with the cost increases that Mr. Trump’s import taxes were imposing on them. They had imported a lot of inventory before the tariffs took effect, in anticipation of seasonal Christmas and Valentine’s Day demand. Ms. Lee is also exploring whether to delay some shipments in hopes that Mr. Trump might reverse course on his tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Pushing off orders is a risk. Ms. Lee, 56, worries about not having products available for customers. Her Chinese suppliers, already feeling the pinch from a sluggish domestic economy, will be strained from holding inventory for longer periods.</p><p>“How much of a bet can you push onto them?” Ms. Lee said, referring to her suppliers, whom she had grown close to after working together for more than a decade. “The uncertainty is really hard on both sides.”</p><p>Ultimately, the additional expense might have to be passed on to the consumer. Mr. Keefe, 71, said the price of a popular silk pajama set, which retails for $300, might increase $15.</p><p>However, the 20-year-old company has little choice but to stay in China. Silk manufacturing facilities exist in other countries, such as Sri Lanka, India, South Korea and Thailand, but “the best machinery, the best expertise, the ability to produce quality goods at a good price is located in China,” Mr. Keefe said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-12"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/28/multimedia/00TRUMP-TARIFFS-IMPACT-02-fvkt/00TRUMP-TARIFFS-IMPACT-02-fvkt-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Rachel Woolf for The New York Times</span></span></p><div><p>“It’s very fine to say we’re going to put these tariffs in place to bring jobs back to America.

On top of that, he may have to start paying an additional ​tariff when he imports his products from Mexico. He said it was not clear whether he would be taxed twice, but the possibility of it “keeps me up at night.”</p><p>Mr. Ernst, who runs the business with his brother, said his Mexican suppliers were willing to absorb a 5 percent cost increase. However, Snap Supply will have to pass on the rest of the cost spike to customers. He said a $23 oven replacement part could soon cost $31. If Snap Supply raises prices too much, he fears his business will become uncompetitive with Chinese companies selling similar parts on Amazon.</p><p>He is also worried that the tariffs may force his company to lay off some of his 45 employees, he said.</p><p>“We’ve never felt so affected by something a president has done,” he said. “It’s so frustrating to see what is actually happening.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Ms. Campbell, the seller of religious goods, said she was contemplating passing some of the additional costs from tariffs on to her customers.
