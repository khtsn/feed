Court records said they used an unidentified tool to remove the tags.</p><p>Next, Ms. Lawes-Richards and a third person would hide merchandise under their clothes, and they’d walk out of the store just ahead of Mr. Richards, the investigator said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When the store’s alarm would sound, Mr. Richards would show his bag to Lululemon workers. Inside the bag would be the items he paid for, one of which had a security tag attached, the investigator said.</p><p>Amid the distraction, Ms. Lawes-Richards and the third person would leave with the stolen goods. They would not be stopped because store workers assumed that it was Mr. Lawes-Richards’s bag that had set off the alarm, according to court records.</p><p>The couple would take all the stolen items to another store to exchange them without a receipt in a transaction known as an “unverified exchange,” court records show.</p><p>The new items would slightly exceed the value of the stolen ones, and the couple would pay the difference, prompting the store to issue them a receipt. Then they would take the stolen items, and the newly obtained receipt, to a different store to return everything and receive a refund.</p><p>Lululemon, an athleisure apparel maker known for its leggings, said in court records that it estimated that it had lost close to $1 million because of the theft ring.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Richards and Ms. Lawes-Richards appeared in court on Nov. 18 and posted bail, according to the Ramsey County Attorney’s Office.</p><p>They each face up to 15 years in prison and a $35,000 fine. It was not immediately clear whether the couple had lawyers.</p><p>“We will do everything in our power to hold these defendants accountable and continue to work with our law enforcement partners and retail merchants to put a stop to retail theft in our community,” Dennis Gerhardstein, spokesman for the county attorney’s office, said in a statement.</p><p>This is the first case that the county is prosecuting under a state law, enacted last year, that addresses organized retail theft.</p><p>The law increased penalties when the intent is to resell items, and not to shoplift goods for personal use.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A person is guilty of organized retail theft, the law says, if he or she is working with at least one other person in “a retail theft enterprise”; was previously involved in at least two separate retail thefts in a six-month period; and tried to sell the goods or return them for anything of value.</p><p>The National Retail Federation is <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/no-nrf-annual-retail-shrink-report-2024/729009/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no longer</a> publishing its data on inventory lost to theft and errors, also known as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/02/business/what-is-retail-shrink.html" title="">shrink.</a>” In its most <a href="https://cdn.nrf.com/sites/default/files/2023-09/NRF_National_Retail_Security_Survey_2023.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent report</a>, using data from 2022, the group estimated losses to American retailers to be about $112 billion per year.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adeel Hassan is a reporter and editor on the National Desk.
