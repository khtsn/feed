<p>World Stock Markets This Month</p>
</div></section><p><time datetime="2025-04-23T05:06:57-04:00"><span>Published <!-- -->April 22, 2025</span><span>Updated <!-- -->April 23, 2025, <span>5:06 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump’s remark that he had “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/trump-powell-fed.html" title="">no intention</a>” of firing the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, lifted markets on Wednesday, offering some relief from trade war tensions that have gripped investors. </p><p>Mr. Trump’s statement late Tuesday, along with earlier reports that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors that he expected the tariff standoff with China to ease “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/scott-bessent-tax-cuts.html" title="">over the very near future</a>,” combined to calm the latest jitters. S&amp;P 500 futures signaled a 2 percent gain when trading begins in New York on Wednesday, following a gain of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/trump-tariffs-stocks-gold-price.html" title="">2.5 percent</a> on Tuesday.</p><p>The positive wave moved across Asia and Europe. Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.9 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 2.5 percent, and in Germany, the DAX jumped 2.8 percent.</p><p>The rally came after a 2.4 percent slide on Monday, and echoed the sharp move in markets earlier this month when Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-stock-markets.html" title="">paused many of his “reciprocal” tariffs</a> hours after they were imposed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But for many investors, this week’s rebound is still only a partial recovery from previous declines. The S&amp;P 500, the main benchmark for U.S. stocks, sits nearly 12 percent below its level on Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump took office, with Wall Street remaining captive to the latest statements from the White House.</p><p>“The erratic threaten-retreat-threaten-retreat cycle has economic consequences,” Paul Donovan, the chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note. “The uncertainty this causes may impact consumer and business decision-making.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the markets:</p><ul><li><p>Leading the stock gains in Asia was Taiwan, where the benchmark index was up 4.5 percent. Markets in Taiwan, whose technology supply chain could be damaged by the tariffs, have been hammered since Mr. Trump took office.</p></li><li><p>The dollar regained some of its recent losses. It was up 0.3 percent against the euro, but unchanged against the Japanese yen.</p></li><li><p>The price of 10-year Treasury bonds rose, a sign that investors were more willing to buy U.S. debt. The yield, which moves inversely to price, dropped to 4.35 percent.</p></li><li><p>Oil futures rose 2 percent. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded above $68 per barrel, the highest in nearly three weeks.</p></li><li><p>Gold, which hit a record $3,500 an ounce on Tuesday, eased back. It fell to around $3,300 on Wednesday, down more than 2 percent for the day.</p></li></ul></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
