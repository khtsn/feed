In the twig-like thinness of her arms. In the pounds she and those around her have lost. In the two tomatoes, two green chili peppers and single cucumber a destitute child can buy to feed his family that day.</p><p>Until last week, Israel had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/middleeast/israel-aid-halt-gaza.html" title="">blocked</a> all food, fuel and medicine from entering the Gaza Strip for 80 days, attempting to pressure Hamas into releasing the Israeli hostages it still holds as negotiations over a cease-fire remain deadlocked.</p><p>With international alarm surging over its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">total blockade</a>, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/gaza-aid-delays-israel.html" title="">allowed in</a> a drip of aid starting last week. That enabled some bakeries to reopen. But humanitarian officials said it did little to alleviate Gaza’s enormous needs and to stop the territory’s slide toward famine. Limited amounts of food began being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-site-israel.html" title="">distributed</a> to residents on Tuesday under a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid-plan.html" title="">much-criticized</a> plan backed by Israel.</p><p>In northern Gaza, cut off by Israeli troops from the rest of the territory, hundreds of thousands of people are reduced to waiting for hours for charity-kitchen food that runs out too soon and to digging boreholes for water to drink, unsanitary though it might be.</p><p>There is never enough.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-1"><div><p>Najwa Hussein Hajjaj, 6, has lost 42 percent of her body weight in the last two months, going from about 34 pounds to 21 pounds. Najwa needs specially prepared meals because of an esophagus condition, but her family can barely find any food at all. Doctors have diagnosed her with severe malnutrition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-2"><div><p>People struggle to find fuel for hospital generators, cars and cooking stoves. Families have resorted to burning wood or even trash. Here, Bashir Sami Ashour’s family cooked soup over an open fire in Gaza City, in the north.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-3"><div><p>Pastry shops like this one, along with grocery stores, have long since run out of anything to sell. Bakeries have no fuel to bake with.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-4"><div><p>There is no electricity and little clean water available in Gaza, so people dig for whatever water they can find. Then, like this boy in Jabaliya camp, they lug it away in plastic containers — an ever harder task for people weakened by malnutrition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-5"><div><p>Vegetable markets in Gaza City were bustling before the war. But with nothing being imported and Gaza’s farmland mostly destroyed or inaccessible because of evacuation orders, there is now little produce for sale.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-6"><div><p>What few fruits and vegetables are available are far too expensive for most families, so if they buy at all, they buy by the piece, not by the usual kilogram. This week, locally grown tomatoes cost $11.30 per kilogram — about two pounds — and locally grown cucumbers cost $10 per kilogram at this market in Gaza City.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-7"><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/29/29-vid-gaza-2-82083-cover/29-vid-gaza-2-82083-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A mother living in a tent tried to feed eight children from a few small bowls of food.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-8"><div><p>Ordered by the Israeli military to leave growing swaths of Gaza, people have been herded into ever-smaller zones. About 90 percent of Gaza’s population of roughly two million has been displaced from home. Most have been displaced multiple times since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas led a deadly surprise attack on Israel, drawing a crushing military retaliation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-9"><div><p>Najwa’s family was displaced from Shajaiye to Gaza City and now lives in a tent. The Jordanian authorities, who heard about her case, are trying to evacuate her to receive medical care abroad, her family said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-10"><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/29/29-vid-gaza-3-57097-cover/29-vid-gaza-3-57097-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With bakeries closed for lack of wheat flour and fuel, people grind pasta down into flour that they can bake into bread.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-11"><div><p>Lentils, too, are being ground into flour for patties or bread. In all, people bring between 400 and 500 kilograms of lentils, rice, pasta and other dry goods a day, some of it saved from when more aid was entering Gaza, to Gaza City’s Jaber Mill, which grinds it down. The owner, Ahmed Jaber, said some people had no choice but to grind up spoiled or rotten supplies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-12"><div><p>Residents of the northernmost part of Gaza have fled the fighting to this school, now a shelter, in Gaza City. They line up their buckets to reserve a turn to fill them whenever the school’s water main starts pumping or when a water truck comes by. Those who arrive too late miss their chance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-13"><div><p>As bakeries closed and aid groups ran out of supplies to distribute to families, local charity kitchens, including this one in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, became some of the only places many Palestinians in Gaza could find food.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-14"><div><p>Adeel Adeeb Sukkar ran one kitchen in Gaza City, relying on donations from relatives abroad to provide free meals to 500 desperate displaced families a day.</p><p>By Sunday, with his stocks gone, he had been forced to close.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
