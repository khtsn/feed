It is known as a community that has long welcomed immigrants. A century ago, it was home to many Jewish families from Europe. It is now a draw for Latino, white and Asian people.</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez’s father, Eric Rodriguez, is a union member <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1153962276435857" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who appeared in a video</a> for the Service Employees International Union this year, identifying himself as a federal employee with the Veterans Affairs Department and an Iraq War veteran. The elder Mr. Rodriguez said in the video that he was concerned about cuts that the Trump administration was making to the V.A. system.</p><p>Both of Elias Rodriguez’s parents, who live separately, declined to comment.</p><p>Elias Rodriguez bounced from job to job during his 20s. According to his LinkedIn profile, he worked as a writer for wikiHow, which publishes articles and quizzes on a variety of topics. He was a senior content associate for CouponCabin, a company based in Chicago that provides printable and digital coupons for discounts to consumers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He later worked as an oral history researcher and production coordinator at a Black history site, and then took a job at the American Osteopathic Information Association, a trade group for osteopathic doctors.</p><p>“He enjoys reading and writing fiction, live music, film, and exploring new places,” one job biography read.</p><h2 id="link-78c95f30">A turn to political activism on the left</h2><p>At the same time, Mr. Rodriguez had taken an active interest in politics. In 2017, he was photographed outside the home of former Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Chicago’s North Side, wearing a checked shirt and backpack, and holding a sign that read, “$ for people’s needs, not Amazon!”</p><p>The demonstration was organized by the Answer Coalition, a group that opposes war and racism. The group was protesting efforts from Chicago officials to convince Amazon to build a second headquarters in the city. The company ultimately chose the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington.</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez was quoted in an online article denouncing the officials’ effort, identifying himself as affiliated with the Party for Socialism and Liberation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The wealth that Amazon has brought to Seattle has not been shared with its Black residents,” he said, asking, “Do we in Chicago and all across the country want a nation of cities dominated and occupied by massive corporations where only the rich and white can live, and the vast majority of us must live on edges of the city and society living in deeper and deeper poverty?”</p><p>The Party for Socialism and Liberation disavowed on Thursday any connection between the organization and Mr. Rodriguez.</p><p>“We reject any attempt to associate the PSL with the D.C. shooting,” <a href="https://x.com/pslnational/status/1925468146024034305" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the group said on the social media site X</a>. “Elias Rodriguez is not a member of the PSL. He had a brief association with one branch of the PSL that ended in 2017. We know of no contact with him in over 7 years. We have nothing to do with this shooting and do not support it.”</p><p>A post on social media on Wednesday night from an account that The New York Times verified as belonging to Mr. Rodriguez was titled “Escalate For Gaza, Bring The War Home.” The post condemned the Israeli and American governments and what it called atrocities committed by the Israeli military against Palestinians. The post did not refer directly to the shootings, but sought to justify “armed action.”</p><p>Photographs on Thursday of the windows of what appeared to be Mr. Rodriguez’s apartment in Chicago showed two signs about Palestinians, including one that referenced the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/illinois-hate-crime-sentencing.html" title="">2023 killing</a> of a Palestinian American boy in Illinois.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Rodriguez was registered to vote in Illinois, and in 2020 donated $500 to Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign, records show.</p><p>Superintendent Larry Snelling of the Chicago Police Department said that Mr. Rodriguez did not have a criminal background.</p><p>Aric Toler<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times, writing and reporting stories from around the Midwest.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Tensions in the Middle East</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Warning Shots:</strong> Israeli soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/world/middleeast/israel-warning-shots-west-bank.html">fired warning shots to disperse a group of senior Western diplomats, Palestinian officials and journalists</a> as they toured a Palestinian city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to statements by the Israeli military and the Palestinian Authority and television footage from the scene.</p></li><li><p><strong> West Bank Attack:</strong> An Israeli woman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/middleeast/west-bank-shooting-pregnant-woman.html">on the way to a hospital to give birth</a> was shot and killed in the territory, in an attack that Hamas applauded as a “heroic act.”</p></li><li><p><strong> </strong><strong>Gazans Once Escaped to Rafah.
