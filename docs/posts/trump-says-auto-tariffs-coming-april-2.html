    <h1>Trump Says Auto Tariffs Coming April 2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Trump has announced plans to impose 25 percent tariffs beginning March 12 on foreign steel and aluminum, which are major inputs for the auto industry.</p><p>He proposed a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico, which supply raw materials and parts and are home to manufacturing sites for major automakers. Mr. Trump has paused those overall tariffs until Mar. 4, as he negotiates with the countries over concessions on drugs and migrants. But he moved ahead earlier this month with an additional 10 percent tariff on China, which is also a major auto parts supplier.</p><p>On Thursday, the president also revealed the details of a “reciprocal tariff” plan, where he ordered his advisers to come up with new tariffs to charge other countries based on their tariffs, taxes, and other trade behavior the president deemed “unfair.”</p><p>He said that plan could result in tariffs beginning April 2, and he has complained particularly about European tariffs on American cars. The European Union charges a 10 percent tariff on the American vehicles it imports. The United States charges a tariff of only 2.5 percent on European cars — though it charges a 25 percent tariff on light pickup trucks.</p><p>Auto manufacturers depend on highly global and integrated supply chains. Tens of billions of dollars’ worth of finished automobiles, engines, transmissions and other components are shipped each week across the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico, while billions of dollars more are imported from parts manufacturers in China.</p></div></div>
