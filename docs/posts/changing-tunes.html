    <h1>Changing Tunes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I loved reading about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/arts/music/alexandre-kantorow-piano.html" title="">the 27-year-old French pianist Alexandre Kantorow</a>, a rising star in the classical world who’s won major awards, played in the rain in the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics and is set to make his debut at the Los Angeles Philharmonic on Friday. What struck me about Kantorow is his commitment to keeping his life and his working practices the same, even as he seems destined for fame, even as fans crowd outside his performances holding signs begging for seats.</p><p>“I don’t really like change, and unnecessary change in life,” Kantorow told The Times. He’s had the same manager and teacher since he was 16 and remains with his small record label.</p><p>Resisting unnecessary change, what a concept! In the stock fantasy of fame, one imagines all the ways in which their life will transform, each upgrade bigger and flashier. I can’t pretend to know what it would feel like to be a musician on the precipice of stardom, but I’d guess the temptation to shed one’s old ways of working would be fierce.</p><p>Listening to Kantorow’s latest album, a collection of Brahms and Schubert pieces, I wondered how a commitment to keeping things stable affects an artist’s output. Will the “intriguing tension between Kantorow’s lucid, pearly touch and the Romantic wildness of his music-making,” as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/arts/music/alexandre-kantorow-piano-carnegie.html" title="">classical music critic Zachary Woolfe put it</a>, be altered by the inevitable changes that accompany success? What about an artist is essential, impervious to any external forces?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I recently rewatched “Shine a Light,” Martin Scorsese’s concert film of the Rolling Stones’s performances at the Beacon Theater in New York in 2006. The intimate way the film is shot makes you feel that you’re onstage, up close watching artists make art. You forget that you’re observing one of the most successful rock bands in history, that these people have played these songs a million times, that they are basically unknowable in their fame and riches and the way the world regards them. Instead they feel familiar, almost cozily accessible. The ways in which celebrity and fortune have changed them feel beside the point. The early 21st-century Mick Jagger of “Shine a Light” is to this fan essentially the same as the one strutting in 1970’s “Gimme Shelter,” the same one romancing the crowd during the Stones’ “Hackney Diamonds” tour last year.</p><p>The idea of there being something fundamentally stable about an artist, independent of outside forces, makes sense. It’s what allows them to experiment with style and genre and persona and still be legible to their audiences. Of course, fans are well known to accuse the artists they love of abandoning their them-ness (see: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/movies/bob-dylan-newport-folk-festival.html" title="">Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival</a>), of changing beyond recognition. As annoying as this must be for an artist, I wonder if there is something sort of wonderful about having a fan base that wants you to stay true, that so loves what they think is the elemental part of you that they want to help you safeguard it.</p><p>We do this with the people we actually know all the time, provide them with a mirror that reflects back to them the person we love. The challenge, in art and life, is to allow people to morph and experiment while trusting that the essence we adore is basically indelible. It isn’t going anywhere, no matter how much change we opt for or resist.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>Alexandre Kantorow’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/arts/music/best-classical-music-albums-recordings-2024.html" title="">“Brahms and Schubert”</a> was one of The Times’s best classical music albums of last year.</p></li><li><p>“The sheer pleasure of making music that keens and growls like a pack of ravenous alley cats is obviously what keeps them going.” From 2008, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/movies/04shin.html" title="">a review of the Rolling Stones concert film, “Shine a Light.”</a></p></li></ul><h3 id="link-1439ed98"><span><strong>THE WEEK IN CULTURE</strong></span></h3><p>Film and TV</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Karla Sofía Gascón in “Emilia Pérez.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pathé Films</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pete Hegseth arrived at the Capitol on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/25/world/israel-hamas-hostages-cease-fire" title="">freed four female Israeli soldiers</a> held hostage in Gaza in a carefully choreographed display.

Dog Man — a spinoff of Pilkey’s other popular series, Captain Underpants — tells the story of a half-man, half-dog police officer who battles a villainous cat named Petey.

Eating dumplings is a time-honored way to celebrate, and Sue Li’s plush <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025420-vegetable-dumplings?algo=cooking_search_relevance_metric_ios_and_web&amp;fellback=false&amp;imp_id=7539693432950798&amp;req_id=5403533260517850&amp;surface=cooking-search-web&amp;variant=0_relevance_reranking" title="">vegetable dumplings</a> are a deeply flavorful option that happen to be vegan. Her trick is to bind the vegetables with tofu in place of the pork fat that’s more traditionally used. Homemade dumplings do take time to prepare, but they freeze well, meaning you can make them this weekend to cook up on Wednesday. And if making the wrappers from scratch seems like one step too many, fear not. Store-bought dumpling skins will work here, too.</p><h3 id="link-20a8f964"><span><strong>REAL ESTATE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Heather Anderson and Chris Kinney</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lisa Corson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cristina Spano</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Health: </strong>Ten gut myths, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/well/gut-health-myths.html" title="">corrected by experts</a>.</p><p><strong>Looks: </strong>In New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/style/street-style-look-clashing-prints.html" title="">clashing prints</a> was the street trend of the week.</p><p><strong>Travel: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/23/travel/things-to-do-quebec-city.html" title="">Spend 36 hours in Quebec City</a>.</p><p><strong>Dry January: </strong>Round the month with these <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/article/nonalcoholic-drinks-dry-january" title="">fun and easy nonalcoholic drinks</a>.</p><h3 id="link-2a884c79"><span><strong>ADVICE FROM WIRECUTTER</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-6d567a25">Stellar instant noodles</h2><p>Ramen is shedding its reputation as college survival food.
