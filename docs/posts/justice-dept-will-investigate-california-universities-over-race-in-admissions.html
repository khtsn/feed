The plaintiffs argued the practice violated the 14th Amendment.</p><p>Unlike schools in most states, however, California public colleges and universities have been prohibited from using affirmative action in college admissions since Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996.</p><p>Enrollment of Black and Hispanic students and other minority groups dropped precipitously in the more selective public schools in California after the proposition was enacted. Since then it has rebounded at least somewhat. For example, Black enrollment at U.C.L.A. fell to 3.43 percent in 1998 from 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. (California’s population is 6.5 percent Black.)</p><p>As a private school, Stanford did not fall under the Proposition 209 requirements.</p><p>Stanford said in a statement that it had taken steps to comply with the Supreme Court decision and that it was “committed to fulfilling our obligations under the law.” The statement added that the school had not received any details about the investigation from the Justice Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The University of California system was not immediately available to comment on the Justice Department announcement.</p><p>The review follows a lawsuit filed in February accusing the University of California system of violating protections against racial discrimination in admissions. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Students Against Racial Discrimination, which was organized by a persistent critic of affirmative action, asked for a court order requiring that the system select students “in a colorblind manner,” to “eliminate the corrupt and unlawful race and sex preferences that subordinate academic merit to so-called diversity considerations.”</p><p>Separately on Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services said it was launching an investigation into accusations that a “major medical school” in California had used discriminatory admissions practices. It did not specify which school.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephanie-saul">More about Stephanie Saul</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Education in America</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Targeting Grants for Teachers:</strong> The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to let it cancel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-teacher-grants.html">$65 million in teacher-training grants</a> that it contends would promote diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Columbia Protest Rules:</strong> A lawyer for the university said that a demand from the Trump administration for dramatic changes in student discipline had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/nyregion/columbia-campus-rules-khalil-lawsuit.html">merely sped up policies</a> the university had already been planning to enforce.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increasing Enrollment:</strong> Colleges are expecting what could be the largest freshman class ever this fall at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/colleges-students-financial-crisis-politics-affirmative-action.html">a moment of extraordinary turmoil</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Schism</strong><strong> at </strong><strong>Hillel:</strong> The war in Gaza brought more students to the Jewish campus organization, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/hillel-campus-protests-israel.html">has sown divisions among Jewish students</a> over the group’s mission.</p></li><li><p><strong>Researchers</strong><strong> Turn to Europe:</strong> European universities have begun <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/europe-trump-science-research.html">recruiting researchers who lost their jobs</a> in the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts, or are anxious over perceived threats to academic freedom.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
