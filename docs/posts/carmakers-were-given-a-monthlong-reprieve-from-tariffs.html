    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump announced today that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/trump-lutnick-tariffs-reduction-canada-mexico.html" title="">cars would receive a one-month exemption</a> from the sweeping 25 percent tariffs he imposed this week on imports from Mexico and Canada. The president said he made the decision after speaking with America’s three largest automakers, whom he pushed to move their production facilities to the U.S., according to the White House.</p><p>Trump’s initial rollout of the tariffs, which also included fees on imports from China, drew pushback from American businesses and roiled financial markets. As my colleagues Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan have reported, the stock market is one of the few forces that can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/trump-tv-stock-market.html" title="">convince Trump to change his mind</a>. The S&amp;P 500 ended today up 1.1 percent.</p><p>The president declined to offer a reprieve to Canada, despite overtures today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump said he was not satisfied with Canada’s efforts to reduce the flow of fentanyl across the border, even though the U.S. intercepted just 43 pounds of fentanyl there in all of 2024.</p><p>In Mexico, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/americas/trump-mexico-tariffs-sheinbaum.html" title="">leaders were frustrated</a> because they believed they had met all of Trump’s demands to avert the tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators outside the Capitol last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Valerie Plesch for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-614aec48">The Supreme Court ruled against the foreign aid freeze</h2><p>The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision released today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/foreign-aid-supreme-court-trump.html" title="">rejected Trump’s plan</a> to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid as part of his efforts to slash government spending. The majority was formed by two conservative justices and all three liberals.</p><p>The ruling was one of the court’s first moves in response to Trump’s spending cuts. It suggested that the president will face a Supreme Court more skeptical than its mostly conservative composition might indicate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian artillery unit near the front lines in the eastern Dnipro region last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-681db921">The U.S. paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine</h2><p>The C.I.A. director, John Ratcliffe, said today that the U.S. had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/cia-director-ukraine-intelligence.html" title="">stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine</a>, after Trump’s decision this week to suspend the delivery of military aid to the country. Officials said the pauses were designed to pressure Ukraine to cooperate with Trump’s plan to end the war with Russia.</p><p>Some U.S. officials suggested that the moves could be relatively short-lived if Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, bends to the demands of the White House. And after some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-trump.html" title="">prodding and counseling from European leaders</a>, Zelensky is now working to get in Trump’s good graces.</p><p>But if Trump continues to withhold U.S. support, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/trump-ukraine-aid.html" title="">it could reorder the battlefield</a>. “If Russia sees potential for quick military gains from a weakened Ukraine, the incentive for talks will diminish for Moscow,” said Andrew Kramer, our Kyiv bureau chief. Trump, Andrew added, “is essentially asking Ukraine to agree to terms in advance, without knowing what they are.”</p><p><strong>For more: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/americas/ukraine-us-weapons-suspension.html" title="">These charts show how crucial U.S. aid is for Ukraine</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-80f6d0e">A secret campaign to save a woman chained by the neck</h2><p>Three years ago, a video blogger stumbled upon a shack in a village in eastern China.</p><p>Inside was a woman — dazed, shivering and chained up by the neck.
