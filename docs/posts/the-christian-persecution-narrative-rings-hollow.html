Millions of my fellow evangelicals believe we are, or they believe we’re one election away from a crackdown. This sense of dread and despair helps tie conservative Christians, people who center their lives on the church and the institutions of the church, to Donald Trump — the man they believe will fight to keep faith alive.</p><p>As I told my friend, the short answer is no, not by any meaningful historical definition of persecution. American Christians enjoy an immense amount of liberty and power.</p><p>But that’s not the only answer. American history tells the story of two competing factions that possess very different visions of the role of faith in American public life. Both of them torment each other, and both of them have made constitutional mistakes that have triggered deep cultural conflict.</p><p>One of the most valuable and humbling experiences in life is to experience an American community as part of the in-group and as part of the out-group. I spent most of my life living in the cultural and political center of American evangelical Christianity, but in the past nine years I’ve been relentlessly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/opinion/presbyterian-church-evangelical-canceled.html" title="">pushed to the periphery</a>. The process has been painful. Even so, I’m grateful for my new perspective.</p></div></div><div><div><p>When you’re inside evangelicalism, Christian media is full of stories of Christians under threat — of <a href="https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/21/03/191696P.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">universities</a> <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-7th-circuit/1064032.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discriminating</a> against Christian student groups, of a Catholic foster care agency <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-123_g3bi.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied city contracts</a> because of its stance on marriage or of churches that faced <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/02/divided-court-allows-indoor-worship-services-to-resume-in-california/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discriminatory treatment during Covid</a>, when secular gatherings were <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a87_4g15.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">often privileged over religious worship</a>.</p><p>Combine those stories with the personal tales of Christians who faced death threats, intimidation and online harassment for their views, and it’s easy to tell a story of American backsliding — a nation that once respected or even revered Christianity now persecutes Christians. If the left is angry at conservatives for seeking the protection of a man like Trump, then it has only itself to blame.</p><p>But when you’re pushed outside evangelicalism, the world starts to look very different. You see conservative Christians attacking the fundamental freedoms of their opponents. Red-state legislatures pass laws <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/florida-ron-desantis-stop-woke-act-part-overturned/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restricting the free speech</a> of progressives and <a href="https://www.aclutx.org/en/press-releases/court-issues-permanent-injunction-declaring-texas-drag-ban-unconstitutional" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">L.G.B.T.Q. Americans</a>. Christian school board members attempt to <a href="https://pen.org/report/banned-in-the-usa-state-laws-supercharge-book-suppression-in-schools/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restrict access to books</a> in the name of their own moral norms. Other conservatives <a href="https://time.com/6899864/same-sex-marriage-supreme-court-biden-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">want to reverse</a> the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, to bring legal recognition of same-sex marriages to an end.</p><p>Combine those stories with personal tales of progressives and other dissenters experiencing threats from and intimidation by conservative Christians, and you begin to see why the Christian persecution narrative rings hollow. And if conservative Christians are angry at progressive Americans for believing they are hateful hypocrites, then they have only themselves to blame.</p><p>After living inside and outside conservative evangelicalism, I have a different view. While injustice is real, the Christian persecution narrative is fundamentally false. America isn’t persecuting Christians; it’s living with the fallout of two consequential constitutional mistakes that distort our politics and damage our culture.</p></div></div><div><div><p>First, for most of American history, courts underenforced the establishment clause of the First Amendment. It wasn’t even held clearly applicable to the states <a href="https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/everson-v-board-of-education/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">until 1947</a>. Americans lived under what my colleague Ross Douthat calls the “<a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2022/06/a-gentler-christendom" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soft hegemony of American Protestantism</a>.” It was “soft” in part because America never possessed a national church on par with European establishments, but it was certainly hard enough to mandate Bible readings and prayer in schools and to pass a host of explicitly <a href="https://ij.org/issues/school-choice/blaine-amendments/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anti-Catholic Blaine Amendments</a> that were intended to blunt Catholic influence in the United States.</p><p>This soft hegemony wasn’t constitutionally or culturally sustainable. Mandating Protestant Scripture readings is ultimately incompatible with a First Amendment that doesn’t permit the state to privilege any particular sect or denomination. Culturally, the process of diversification and secularization makes any specific religious hegemony impossible. There simply aren’t a sufficient number of Americans of any single faith tradition to dominate American life.</p><p>In the 1960s the Warren court began dismantling the soft Protestant establishment by blocking <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1961/468" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">school prayer</a> and <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1962/142" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scripture reading</a>. A series of cases limited the power of the state to express a religious point of view. But then state and local governments overcorrected. They overenforced the establishment clause and violated the free speech and free exercise clauses by taking aim at private religious expression.</p><p>The desire to disentangle church and state led to a search-and-destroy approach to religious expression in public institutions. <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000/99-2036" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Public schools</a> and <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-689" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public colleges</a> denied religious organizations equal access to public facilities. <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-577" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">States</a> and <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1994/94-329" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public colleges</a> denied religious institutions equal access to public funds.</p><p>I started my legal career in 1994, when equal access was very much in doubt. I spent the better part of two decades filing lawsuit after lawsuit that made essentially the same claim: State actors must treat religious speech the same as they treat secular speech. The proper interplay between the free exercise clause and the establishment clause ought to mean that private religious speech should neither be favored nor disfavored by the government. The state can’t run the church, and the church can’t run the state.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Supreme Court has spent much of the past two decades correcting the overcorrection that began in the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, religious liberty proponents haven’t lost a significant Supreme Court case in 14 years. During that time, the court has established (often through supermajorities that include justices from the left and the right) that people of faith enjoy <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000/99-2036" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">equal access to school facilities</a>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-577" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">equal access to public funds</a> (including tuition assistance to <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/18-1195" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fund private religious education</a>) and <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/10-553" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extraordinary independence from nondiscrimination laws</a> that would otherwise interfere with the <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/19-267" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiring and firing of ministerial employees</a>.</p><p>Conservative and liberal justices have created a different, sustainable equilibrium, but the religious liberty culture war rages on anyway — in part because millions of Americans don’t want to strike a balance. They actually prefer domination to accommodation. Many conservative evangelicals miss the old Protestant establishment, and they want it back. This is part of the impulse behind the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/us/louisiana-ten-commandments-landry.html" title="">recent Ten Commandments law</a> in Louisiana, for example, or the recent effort in Oklahoma to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/opinion/oklahoma-church-state-religion.html" title="">establish a religious charter school</a>, a public school run by the Catholic Church.</p><p>Combine these efforts at religious establishment with red-state legislation aimed at progressive and L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, and one could fairly assert that Christians are persecuting their opponents.</p><p>But there’s more to it than that. There are secular Americans who do take aim at Christian expression and at Christian institutions. They don’t want separation of church and state so much as they seek <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zdvxdrxmqvx/01132023titleix_colleges.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regulation of the church by the state</a>, to push the church into conformance with a secular political ideology.</p><p>Then both sides tear into each other with an inexcusable level of fury and malice. When I was representing conservative Christian organizations, I could regale Christian audiences with stories of extreme secular intolerance, and I never ran out of material — especially when discussing religious liberty on college campuses.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Then conservative evangelicalism ejected me from its ranks, and I experienced a level of anger and malice that eclipsed anything I experienced from the most vitriolic secular progressives. I started to hear from others who’d experienced the same thing, and my eyes opened. Christians are wrecking lives in the name of righteousness.</p><p>Every culture war battle has casualties. Take a 2022 Supreme Court case about a praying high school football coach. He was seeking the right to pray on the field, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/21-418" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and he won</a>. The Supreme Court said his personal prayer was constitutionally protected. But that’s not the entire story.</p><p>Employees in the coach’s school district endured their own ordeal. I was struck by the opening sentence of an essay I read by <a href="https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/opinion/columnists/2022/08/16/supreme-court-football-coach-prayer-carl-bivens-commentary-bremerton-high-school-joe-kennedy/10337977002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a former teacher in the district</a>: “‘That was another death threat,’ our high school secretary said to me after hanging up the phone.” A legal dispute isn’t proof of persecution, but threats most definitely count.</p><p>Christians who bemoan cultural hostility to their faith should be humbled by a sad reality. When it comes to inflicting pain on their political adversaries, conservative Christians often give worse than they get.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>The Christian Persecution Narrative Rings Hollow<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
