Instead, Mexico argues the majority of guns found at Mexican crime scenes come from the United States. It seeks some $10 billion in damages from U.S. gun makers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The dispute comes before the justices at a time of heightened tension between the two countries as the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/canada-mexico-china-trump-tariffs.html" title="">leans on Mexico</a> to crack down on illegal migration and cartel organizations. Tariffs on imported goods from Mexico are scheduled to go into effect on Tuesday — the same day the justices are set to consider the guns lawsuit.</p><p>President Trump has cited drug trafficking from Mexico as one of the factors driving the decision to impose tariffs. His administration has taken a number of steps to push back on the cartels, including <a href="https://www.state.gov/terrorist-designations-of-international-cartels/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designating more than a half-dozen</a> of the criminal groups as foreign terrorist organizations. That move could result in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-drug-cartels-terrorist-mexico.html" title="">penalties</a>, including criminal charges, for companies found to be entangled with the cartels, but it has also raised concerns from the Mexican government of a potential violation of Mexico’s sovereignty.</p><p>Lawyers for Mexico argue that U.S. manufacturers and gun dealers are complicit in what they call an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/damming-the-iron-river-mexico-legal-battle-to-stop-gun-trafficking-from-us-60-minutes-transcript/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“iron river”</a> of firearms pouring into the country and arming cartels. They point to strict controls on gun purchases in Mexico, where civilians are not allowed to purchase the types of rapid-fire, powerful military-style weapons favored by the cartels, as evidence that as many as half a million firearms are smuggled from the United States into Mexico each year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guns seized by the Mexican Army and other authorities, shown in Tijuana last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guillermo Arias/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“It is far easier and far more efficient to stop the crime gun pipeline at its source and to turn off the spigot,” said Jonathan Lowy, president of Global Action on Gun Violence and a longtime litigator against the gun industry who has worked on the case on behalf of Mexico.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The gun makers, joined by a slew of gun groups including the National Rifle Association, have argued the lawsuit would undermine gun rights in the United States.</p><p>“Mexico has extinguished its constitutional arms right and now seeks to extinguish America’s,” the N.R.A. said in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1141/310430/20240522135935043_23-1141%20-%20NRA%20-%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brief</a> in support of the gun makers. “To that end, Mexico aims to destroy the American firearms industry financially.”</p><p>The case may be viewed skeptically by the Supreme Court, where the 6-3 conservative supermajority has worked to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expand gun rights</a>. But at a time when Mr. Trump has targeted the country, it has offered a forum for Mexico to publicize its counter case that U.S. gun manufacturers share the blame for cartel violence. The Mexican government has also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/23/1233577074/mexico-sues-arizona-gun-shops-trafficking-firearms-across-the-border" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued several gun stores</a> in Arizona and could expand the effort by filing additional suits.</p><p>At a <a href="https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trafficking-and-diversion-of-firearms-in-latin-america-responses-reform-and-responsibility/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conference</a> last month in Latin America, Pablo Arrocha, a legal adviser for Mexico’s foreign ministry, <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/02/26/americas/mexico-supreme-court-gun-lawsuit-latam-intl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that two lawsuits filed so far marked only the beginning of a broader legal strategy to push back against the flow of guns across the border.</p><p>For years, Mexico has pushed the United States to do more to curtail the trafficking of American manufactured guns over the border. When Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/03/us/trump-tariffs" title="">announced</a> he would delay tariffs against Mexico earlier this month, both nations had agreed to address their respective concerns: Mexican authorities promised to work to stem the flow of drugs across the border while U.S. authorities would try to combat gun trafficking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In recent days, there have been signs of improving relations between the two countries, including when the Mexican government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/mexico-cartel-sheinbaum-trump.html" title="">this week sent</a> to the U.S. nearly 30 top cartel operatives wanted by the American authorities. But inside the White House, Mr. Trump’s advisers remain split over whether to take more substantial action in Mexico, including carrying out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/americas/mexico-trump-cartels-washington.html" title="">military strikes against Mexican drug cartels</a>.</p><p>A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mexico first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/world/americas/mexico-lawsuit-gun-companies.html" title="">sued</a> multiple gun companies in 2021, arguing that the cartel bloodshed was “the foreseeable result of the defendants’ deliberate actions and business practices.”</p><p>A trial court judge dismissed the case, finding it was barred by a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/397/text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2005 federal law</a> that limits litigation against gun manufacturers and distributors and has provided immunity from actions brought by the families of people killed and injured by their weapons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A funeral procession for a boy killed in a mass shooting at an arcade in Uruapan, Mexico, in 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marco Ugarte/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>A unanimous panel of judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/appeals-court-mexico-lawsuit-gunmakers.html" title="">overturned</a> that decision.
