</span> continue to find wins.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick recap of how each of the opening matchups played out:</p>



<p>With the most dominant 2-0 wins, Evil Geniuses and MIBR currently sit atop each of their groups, but with only tiebreakers keeping them ahead, those results are bound to change. Close behind are the reigning Kickoff champions G2, who shook off a surprising 8-0 lead from FURIA to find a 2-0 victory of their own.</p>

</span> and <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/662/pryze">

</span> both made their first appearances with their new teams, but both 2G and FURIA found themselves on the losing side of the aforementioned 2-0s.</p>

<p>Four out of the six games this week were rematches from Kickoff, all of which also saw the same results as Kickoff.</p>

<p>The first of these rematches was Cloud9 vs NRG. With the new additions of <span data-ref-id="16">

</span>, NRG looked to take their revenge, but instead were delivered their third defeat to Cloud9 since <span data-ref-id="18">

</span>&#39;s return to the team. In what feels like a repeat of 2024, the hyped up NRG team is once again struggling to find their footing in Americas.</p>

<p>We saw KRÜ vs LOUD for the third time this year in a bizarre match that saw both teams stomp the other&#39;s map pick before KRÜ won out a close map three.</p>

</span>. What was a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428009/leviat-n-vs-mibr-champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff-lr3" target="_blank">nailbiter</a> in Kickoff was a bit of a wash the second time around. <span data-ref-id="21">

</span> shone as Leviatán struggled to make their new role assignments work.</p>

<p>The week ended with the good old clout matchup. Sentinels faced 100 Thieves for the seventh time in the Americas league, where they managed to improve their record over the thieves to 6-1. After being dealt a crushing 13-1 <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/449003/team-liquid-vs-sentinels-champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok-r2-0-1/?game=202776&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">loss</a> that eliminated them from Bangkok, Sentinels had the pleasure of delivering their own 13-1 on Split to win the series.</p>
