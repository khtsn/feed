That means that Tesla vehicles will not be subject to tariffs, although the company will still see its production costs rise because of tariffs on imported parts.</p><p>Tesla’s Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan were the two best-selling electric vehicles in the United States last year. But the company has been losing market share to vehicles like General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox E.V. and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E.</p><p>Both of those electric cars are made in Mexico and will become significantly more expensive because they have more imported parts than Tesla cars. The precise impact is unclear because the administration says any U.S. content in cars assembled in Mexico or Canada will be exempt from tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump said Wednesday that Mr. Musk had not influenced his decision to impose tariffs. “He’s never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever,” Mr. Trump said at the White House.</p><p>All automakers, including Tesla, import motors, batteries, raw materials and other parts from other countries. Those components will be subject to tariffs, raising prices across the board. Parts from Canada and Mexico will be granted a temporary reprieve from tariffs until the Trump administration can calculate and exempt from tariffs the U.S. content of each part.</p><p>Analysts and industry executives were still calculating the financial impact. But it is likely that the tariffs will severely disrupt supply chains and lead to production cutbacks and layoffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ford F-150 pickup trucks for sale at a dealership in Austin, Texas, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brandon Bell/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Car prices could rise by thousands of dollars. Analysts at Bernstein said the tariffs would add as much as $75 billion per year to automaker costs, which they would have to pass on to car buyers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Already, many Americans cannot afford to buy new cars. The tariffs will push lower-priced models like the Chevrolet Trax, which is made in South Korea, even further out of reach for middle-income buyers.</p><p>“The folks at the lower end of the buying pool are going to suffer the most,” said Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.</p><p>In the pickup market, one of the industry’s most profitable segments, Ford Motor could have an advantage over rivals. The company makes its F-series pickups at several U.S. factories. Toyota, General Motors and Ram, a division of Stellantis, build significant numbers of pickups in Mexico.</p><p>Virtually all major automakers have factories in the United States, allowing them to produce at least some cars not subject to tariffs on the finished product. BMW produces in South Carolina; Toyota in Kentucky and several other states; Nissan in Tennessee; Mercedes-Benz in Alabama; and Honda in Indiana and Ohio.</p><p>Hyundai on Wednesday inaugurated a new factory in Georgia where it will produce electric vehicles. The South Korean company also produces cars in Alabama.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But Hyundai, Toyota and the German carmakers also import hundreds of thousands of cars from Asia and Europe, which will be subject to 25 percent tariffs.</p><p>Volkswagen could be among the hardest hit. It produces the Atlas S.U.V. and ID.4 electric vehicle in Chattanooga, Tenn., but depends on Mexican factories for models like the Jetta sedan. VW’s Audi division also produces in Mexico for U.S. customers and imports cars from Europe. Porsche, which is also part of Volkswagen, imports all its cars from Europe.</p><p>The tariffs could make it even harder for Volkswagen to sell more cars in the United States where it has long struggled to expand.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-ewing">More about Jack Ewing</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/ford-motor-company">Ford Motor Company</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/general-motors">General Motors</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>India’s Hiring Binge: </strong>Higher U.S. tariffs meant to force India to lower its trade barriers, and the deportations of immigrants from the U.S., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/india-jobs-global-capability-center.html">will not slow the evolution of the partnership</a> between American companies looking for skilled workers overseas and India’s abundant pool of labor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hyundai Looks to Avoid Tariffs:</strong> Hyundai Motor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/hyundai-us-investment-tariffs.html">will invest $21 billion to expand manufacturing</a> in the United States in what President Trump said was proof that his tariff policies were creating jobs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Venezuelan Oil:</strong> President Trump threatened tariffs against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/trump-threatens-tariffs-against-countries-that-buy-venezuelan-oil.html">countries that bought oil from Venezuela</a>, claiming that the South American country “purposefully and deceitfully” sent criminals and murderers into America.</p></li><li><p><strong>Potatoes, Shrimp and Teslas:</strong> Makers of a vast array of American products submitted letters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/economy/trump-tariffs-us-exporters.html">highlighting the unfair trade treatment they faced</a> in hopes of bending the president’s agenda in their favor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Canada’s Small Businesses:</strong> A rice mill in Ontario is among many small businesses being hit by President Trump’s tariffs and also by Canada’s retaliatory levies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/canada/trump-tariffs-canada-small-businesses.html">putting their futures in doubt</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boycotting U.S. Goods:</strong> A growing number of Europeans and citizens of other countries are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/europe/europe-boycott-american-products-trump.html">choosing not to buy American products</a> to demonstrate their anger at Trump’s policies.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
