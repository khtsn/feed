    <h1>Who Are the 51 Men Convicted in the Gisèle Pelicot Rape Trial?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/france-mass-rape-pelicot.html" title="">All 51 defendants</a> in the Gisèle Pelicot rape trial were found guilty on Thursday. Most of the accused received sentences of eight to 10 years, less than the 10- to 18-year terms that the public prosecutor had recommended.</p><p>Ms. Pelicot’s ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, who admitted to drugging and raping her over nearly a decade and bringing other men to their home to participate, received the maximum sentence of 20 years.</p><p>Fifteen of the 50 others were sentenced to eight years. In all, 41 of the men received prison sentences, including 18 who were already behind bars during the trial. Three were given deferred sentences because of their health, and six were released because of time already served. One is on the run and was tried and sentenced in absentia.</p><p>The French news media labeled the defendants, who range in age from 27 to 74, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/france-mass-rape-pelicot.html" title="">Monsieur Tout-le-monde</a>,” or Mr. Every Man, because of how varied and ordinary they appeared during the trial. Most were employed in jobs that reflect the middle- and working-class rural France they come from: truck drivers, carpenters, a prison guard, a nurse, an I.T. expert working for a bank, a local journalist.</p></div></div>
