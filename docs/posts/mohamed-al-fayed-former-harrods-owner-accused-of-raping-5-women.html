Later in his life, he became best known for the romance between his son, Dodi, and Diana, Princess of Wales, who both died in a 1997 car crash in Paris.</p><p>In a BBC documentary released on Thursday called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct6dth" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods,”</a> more than 20 female ex-employees presented harrowing accounts of abuse. The allegations span years and continents, with accusations in London, Paris, St. Tropez and Abu Dhabi.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6x635wpjxo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the BBC investigation</a> is not the first to accuse Mr. Al Fayed of unwanted sexual advances or harassment, it offers the clearest picture yet of abusive patterns of behavior and raise questions about how women’s accounts were dismissed for so long.</p><p><a href="https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/1995/9/holy-war-at-harrods" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A 1995 investigation in Vanity Fair by Maureen Orth</a>, an employee said that Mr. al-Fayed “regularly walked the store on the lookout for young, attractive women to work in his office” and detailed other problematic behavior. Mr. al-Fayed sued for libel but eventually dropped the case.</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/08/mohamed-al-fayed-accused-harassing-17-year-old-harrods-employee/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In 2017</a> and 2018, Channel 4, a British broadcaster, spoke to several people who said Mr. al-Fayed had sexually harassed and groomed female employees.

One, who worked as a personal assistant to Mr. al-Fayed in the 1990s, described being raped by him at his apartment in London when she was 19.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Others described how Mr. al-Fayed would scour the department-store floor and pick women to work in his office. They were given intrusive gynecological health checks and tested for sexually transmitted diseases, the results of which were sent directly to him.</p><p>Former staff from the department store also said that Mr. al-Fayed’s behavior toward women was apparent.</p><p>“It was well known — everybody knew about it,” Tony Leeming, who worked as a department manager in Harrods from 1994 to 2004, told the BBC.</p><p>Harrods issued an apology on Thursday, saying that the organization was “utterly appalled by the allegations of abuse perpetrated by Mohamed al-Fayed.”</p><p>Mr. al-Fayed sold Harrods to Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund in 2010 for 1.5 billion pounds, about $2 billion at today’s exchange rate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“These were the actions of an individual who was intent on abusing his power wherever he operated and we condemn them in the strongest terms,” the company said. “We also acknowledge that during this time his victims were failed and for this we sincerely apologize. We are doing everything we can to fix this.”</p><p>The company said it was now “a very different organization” from the one Mr. al-Fayed had owned and controlled, and added that since 2023, when new information had come to light about allegations of sexual abuse, “it has been our priority to settle claims in the quickest way possible, avoiding lengthy legal proceedings for the women involved.”<em> </em>That process is still available for any current or former Harrods employees, the company added.</p><p>Harrods <a href="https://response.harrods.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also posted instructions</a> for former employees who believe they were victims of sexual misconduct by Mr. al-Fayed, to complete a form to report the allegations to the company. It said that complaints would be considered individually and that if victims wanted to claim compensation, it had an established process.</p><p>Mr. al-Fayed, an Egyptian-born entrepreneur, moved to Britain in 1974, and bought the Ritz Hotel in Paris, alongside his brothers, in 1979. He controlled oil, shipping, banking and real estate around the world, and <a href="https://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/lists/worlds-richest-arabs-2023/mohamed-al-fayed/#:~:text=Mohamed%20Al%20Fayed%20was%20born,the%20storied%20Ritz%20Paris%20hotel." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Forbes</a> had estimated his net worth last year at $2 billion. As his wealth grew, he courted celebrities and grew close to the royal family for a time.</p><p>But it was the death of his son that came to be most associated with him.</p><p>In the years that followed, Mr. al-Fayed became a vocal critic of the royal family, whom he blamed for his son’s death and that of Diana. Mr. al-Fayed was depicted, often framed in a positive light, in the final season of “The Crown,” the Emmy-winning Netflix series that offered a fictionalized version of the lives of Queen Elizabeth and her family.</p><p>Reflecting on the series, one of the women who reported being sexually assaulted by Mr. al-Fayed told the BBC: “I don’t want him to be seen as some kind of hero.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Specia reports on Britain, Ireland and the Ukraine war for The Times.
