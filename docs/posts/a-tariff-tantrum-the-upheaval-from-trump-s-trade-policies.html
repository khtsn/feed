Jim Farley, Ford’s C.E.O., sees only “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/trump-tariffs-american-ceos-reaction" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costs and chaos</a>” from tariffs.</p><p><strong>A recap:</strong> Trump yesterday gave Mexico and Canada a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-pares-back-canada-mexico-tariffs-in-latest-whipsaw-on-trade-5eb75f88?mod=article_inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partial tariff reprieve</a> — exempting levies for one month on products covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade pact Trump signed in his first term. Presumably, that buys time to negotiate a truce, though Trump and his trade team have signaled they’re not willing to budge much.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Traders still hit the sell button.</strong> Trump, who has long cited stock market rallies as a sign his policies are working, blamed “globalists” for tanking stocks. “I’m not even looking at the market, because long term the United States will be very strong with what is happening here,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/trump-says-hes-not-even-looking-at-stock-market.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he told reporters</a> in the Oval Office yesterday.</p><p><strong>Tariffs and tensions are up.</strong> Trump’s levies on aluminum and steel are to go into effect next week, and next month could bring tariffs on agricultural products and automobiles. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada upped the ante, announcing countermeasures on U.S. imports and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/canada-continue-engage-us-tariffs-145340349.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ominously predicting</a>: “We will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>That prompted Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, to call Trudeau <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-03-06-2025/card/bessent-says-canada-s-trudeau-being-a-numbskull-in-trade-talks-kRpC9FIijN3fN3XdUB1Y" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a “numbskull”</a> at an Economic Club of New York event yesterday. Meanwhile, some Canadian retailers have pulled California wine, Kentucky bourbon and other American products off store shelves. “That’s worse than a tariff because it’s literally taking your sales away,” Lawson Whiting, the chief executive of the corporation that owns the Tennessee whiskey brand Jack Daniel’s, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/canada/canada-liquor-boycott-tariffs.html" title="">said on an analyst call</a> this week.</p><p><strong>Another data point to consider: </strong>China, another country high on Trump’s tariff hit list, reported today <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/china-had-record-540-billion-of-exports-in-rush-to-beat-tariffs?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $540 billion surge</a> in exports, a sign that tariff fears are scrambling global trade with companies stockpiling goods to limit the hit.</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>President Trump tells cabinet chiefs, not Elon Musk, to take the lead on job cuts.</strong> The president has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/06/us/trump-administration-news/trump-orders-cabinet-secretaries-to-work-with-musks-team-on-the-next-round-of-job-cuts?smid=url-share" title="">changed tack</a> on his signature streamlining effort after mass firings and unorthodox directives from the Department of Government Efficiency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/us/trump-administration-lawsuits.html" title="">prompted lawsuits</a> and the outright <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/elon-musk-email-doge-federal-workers-trump.html" title="">ignoring of cuts by high-level officials</a>. Cabinet secretaries “can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,” Trump announced on his <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114117008305421663" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth Social</a> platform, marking a potentially big shift from Musk’s rapid-fire strategy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Trump’s funding freeze hits a roadblock.</strong> A federal judge yesterday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-funding-freeze-states.html" title="">blocked the president’s hold</a> on billions of dollars worth of congressionally approved funds earmarked for state agencies and governments. The ruling directs all federal agencies to keep the grants flowing, reversing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/27/us/omb-memo.html" title="">White House directive</a> from January. This follows yesterday’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/foreign-aid-supreme-court-trump.html" title="">Supreme Court decision</a> rejecting Trump’s request to freeze billions in foreign aid.</p><p><strong>Stephen A. Smith can now talk politics after striking a new $100 million contract.</strong> The five-year deal with Disney’s ESPN<strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6181819/2025/03/06/stephen-a-smith-contract-espn-first-take/" title="">first reported by The Athletic</a>, makes him one of the highest paid figures in television. Smith had been an N.B.A. commentator for most of his career but in recent years he has been outspoken on a wide manner of topics — and has criticized both Trump and the Democratic Party. That said, the new deal means he’ll be a regular on ESPN’s “First Take” show, but will be less visible elsewhere on the network.</p><p><strong>Trump’s call to repeal the Biden-era CHIPS Act gets a cold shoulder from Republicans.</strong> G.O.P. lawmakers <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5178662-trump-chips-act-repeal-gop-senators/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">point out that the money has already been spent</a>, and they defend the Biden administration program as a way to shore up national security by encouraging foreign manufacturers to build in the United States. Republicans said they’d be willing to work with Trump to make changes, but not to scrap it altogether.</p><h2 id="link-53d57ee1">A deal drought and Musk dominate M.&amp; A. conference</h2><p>At cocktail receptions and dinners in New Orleans this week for attendees of the M.&amp; A. industry’s big conference, the drinks and good times have been flowing freely. So, too, have the complaints that deals aren’t doing the same.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Much of the chatter at Tulane University’s Corporate Law Institute focused on how company leaders have hesitated to strike big takeovers, in large part because of the market uncertainty unfolding in the early days of the second Trump administration, DealBook’s Michael de la Merced reports.</p><p><strong>“There’s a lack of predictability right now,”</strong> Scott Barshay, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison said onstage yesterday. A C.E.O. recently told him that he didn’t want to do a $20 billion deal only to see the market tumble the next day. (Scott, feel free to tell us more!)</p><p>Privately, lawyers, P.R. consultants and others told DealBook the same. The slowdown had less to do with the politics of deal-making under a Trump administration and more to do with the broader worries about whipsawing markets and his tariffs.</p><p><strong>Some said there’s reason to hope things will pick up,</strong> noting the gradual lowering of interest rates and the huge amount of cash on corporate balance sheets — about $3.4 trillion as of Dec. 31. “There’s a lot of interest in M.&amp; A.,” Audra Cohen, a partner at the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, said onstage. Barshay added, “It feels more like a pause to let things stabilize a bit.”</p><p><strong>But the bigger debate was about the state of Delaware.</strong> As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/business/dealbook/trump-tariff-next-moves.html#link-6ef16ac5" title="">DealBook has written</a>, legislation meant to shore up the First State’s status as corporate America’s preferred home base was sure to be a prominent topic of discussion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That led to some feisty back-and-forth about the merits of the bill, known as S.B. 21, which would protect controlling shareholders of companies and could limit shareholder lawsuits. Corporate lawyers defended it as a way to persuade companies to stay put. “It’s very important that this legislation gets passed,” Barshay said.</p><p>Those representing shareholder plaintiffs deplored the bill. “We are disempowering Delaware Courts,” said Ned Weinberger of Labaton Keller Sucharow, arguing that it would lead to the overturning of several key court decisions.</p><p>And Jeroen van Kwawegen of Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann — the firm that represented an investor who challenged Elon Musk’s big Tesla payday — said such a law was unnecessary. “It hurts the Delaware franchise,” he said.</p><p><strong>Bonus: Of course Musk figured into the discourse. </strong>Two trucks parked outside the hotel hosting the conference displayed digital billboards criticizing the bill and <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/musk-appeasement-gambles-delawares-corporate-golden-goose" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">linking it to Musk</a>, whose repeated criticism of Delaware for the denial of his payout has inspired others to consider leaving the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Don’t Let Billionaires Take a Chainsaw to Delaware’s Economy,” read one of the billboards, featuring an image of Musk wielding a chain saw.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A truck with a digital billboard linked Elon Musk to state legislation in Delaware designed to restrict some shareholder lawsuits against companies.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael de la Merced/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-3d1162b8">StubHub finally looks at a public offering</h2><p><strong>The I.P.O.s keep rolling in. </strong>StubHub, a ticketing software company, has held preliminary talks with bankers in recent weeks about holding an initial public offering before the end of the year, two people with knowledge of the matter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/technology/figma-stubhub-ipo.html" title="">told DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and The Times’s Mike Isaac</a>.</p><p>StubHub told Wall Street analysts in an investor meeting on Thursday that it was aiming to raise more than $1 billion in a public offering, according to one attendee.

Baker left the company amid tensions with Fluhr and in 2006 founded Viagogo, a competitor focused on the European market. Baker eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/business/stubhub-viagogo-ebay-sale.html" title="">bought StubHub</a> through his company Viagogo. The deal <a href="https://support.stubhub.com/articles/61000295343-stubhub-and-viagogo-merge-international-business-updates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed last year</a> and operates under the name StubHub Holdings.</p><p><strong>The company considered an I.P.O. last year</strong> at a $16.5 billion valuation, the people with knowledge of the talks said, but shelved the idea amid a dearth of public listings of similar companies.</p><p>Its renewed I.P.O. plans come as ticketing companies are <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/live-nation-2024-earnings-report-1236314734/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seeing slower sales growth</a> with fans cooling on concerts after an initial surge of post-pandemic interest.
