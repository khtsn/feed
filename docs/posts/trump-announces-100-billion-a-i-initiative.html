Stargate could eventually invest as much as $500 billion over four years. The three companies plan to contribute funds to the venture, which will be open to other investors and start with 10 data centers already under construction in Texas.</p><p>The announcement of the joint venture was an early trophy for Mr. Trump, even though the effort to form the venture predates his taking office on Monday. Mr. Trump has promised to accelerate the production of American-made A.I. to compete against China for global leadership in the technology, and on Monday he rolled back an executive order from former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that imposed standards on safety and other requirements for government use of A.I.</p><p>During a news briefing Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he would remove barriers to allow for the creation of more data centers. He said he would make “emergency declarations” to allow Stargate to generate its own electricity, without providing details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This monumental undertaking is a resounding declaration of confidence in America’s potential,” Mr. Trump said from the White House’s Roosevelt Room.</p><p>“We’re going to make it as easy as it can be,” he added.</p><p>OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman; SoftBank’s chief, Masayoshi Son; and Oracle’s founder, Larry Ellison, were at the White House announcement with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Trump separately addressed questions from reporters about the potential sale of TikTok. On Monday he signed an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/technology/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-executive-order.html" title="">executive order that aims to stall enforcement of a law</a> that forces a sale or bans the popular app in the United States over national security concerns.</p><p>When asked if he would be in favor of<span>  </span>Elon Musk buying TikTok, Mr. Trump said, “I would be, yeah.” Then he turned to Mr. Ellison and said Oracle could also purchase TikTok.</p><p>“I have the right to make a deal,” Mr. Trump added.</p><p>Tech executives have rushed to show their support for Mr. Trump in recent months in hopes of currying favor and shielding themselves from regulatory retaliation. They have donated millions to his campaign and inauguration. Mr. Altman attended the inauguration and the chiefs of Google, Apple and Meta occupied prime seats in the Capitol Rotunda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump has extolled the promise of artificial intelligence for economic growth and appointed David Sacks, a venture capital investor, to a new position as his A.I. adviser.</p><p>OpenAI has long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/technology/openai-chatgpt-funding.html" title="">worked on financing</a> its ambitious goals to build data center campuses around the world. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/technology/openai-economic-blueprint.html" title="">This month, the company pitched an economic road map for the new administration</a> that centered on a large-scale plan for U.S. data centers that are used to power A.I. tools like its ChatGPT.</p><p>For years, Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s largest investor, provided data center infrastructure needed to power the start-up. But as the ChatGPT maker struggled to get enough computer power from Microsoft, the two companies agreed that OpenAI could seek additional data centers built by Oracle.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims).</p><p>Last year, Mr. Altman began meeting with investors in the United Arab Emirates, computer chip makers in Asia and officials in Washington, proposing that they unite to build new computer chip factories and data centers across the globe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>After officials in Washington expressed concern that a U.S. company was trying to build vital technology in the Middle East, OpenAI focused on building new data centers in the United States.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cecilia Kang reports on technology and regulatory policy and is based in Washington D.C.
