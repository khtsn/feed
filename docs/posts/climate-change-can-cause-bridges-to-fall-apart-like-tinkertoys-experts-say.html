As heat and flooding scorched and scoured the Midwest, a steel railroad bridge <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/flooding-collapses-rail-bridge-evacuations-iowa-north-dakota-sioux-city/89-112f6c55-dffc-4939-bd0d-4296cf7b9fae" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">connecting Iowa with South Dakota collapsed</a> under surging waters.

But now, extreme heat and increased flooding linked to climate change are accelerating the disintegration of the nation’s bridges, engineers say, essentially causing them to age prematurely.</p><p>The result is a quiet but growing threat to the safe movement of people and goods around the country, and another example of how climate change is reshaping daily life <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/18/climate/climate-change-cotton-tampons.html" title="">in ways Americans may not realize</a>.</p><p>“We have a bridge crisis that is specifically tied to extreme weather events,” said Paul Chinowsky, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder who researches the effects of climate change on infrastructure. “These are not things that would happen under normal climate circumstances. These are not things that we’ve ever seen at this rate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Bridges designed and built decades ago with materials not intended to withstand sharp temperature swings are now rapidly swelling and contracting, leaving them weakened.</p><p>“It’s getting so hot that the pieces that hold the concrete and steel, those bridges can literally fall apart like Tinkertoys,” Dr. Chinowsky said.</p><p>As temperatures reached the hottest in recorded history this year, <a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/12/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much of the nation’s infrastructure</a>, from highways to runways, has suffered. But bridges face particular risks.</p><p>“With bridges, you’re working with infrastructure that may have been planned, designed and built decades ago,” Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, said in an interview. “It’s one of the forms of infrastructure that takes the longest to update or refresh. And yet we’re seeing those vulnerabilities everywhere across the country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bridge connecting North Sioux City, S.D., and Sioux City, Iowa, collapsed in June after flooding. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">KC McGinnis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223307" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study in the journal PLOS ONE</a> found that extreme temperatures resulting from climate change could cause one in four steel bridges in the United States to collapse by 2050. By 2040, failures caused by extreme heat could require widespread bridge repairs and closures, the researchers found.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Another study found that exposure to new levels of extreme heat is <a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/JPCFEV.CFENG-4518" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">causing the pavement on American bridges to buckle</a>.

In 2022, a 30-foot section of bridge on the <a href="https://kesq.com/news/2022/08/24/interstate-10-reopens-following-storm-related-bridge-collapse/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">California-Arizona border of Interstate 10</a>, along a major trucking route from Phoenix to the port of Los Angeles, was swept away during record rainfall. That washout followed a 2015 collapse of another Interstate 10 span, the Tex Wash Bridge, during what was <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/risk-strategic-management/documents/mm-2016-q3-project-spotlight-a11y.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described at the time</a> as a 1,000-year flood. Each closure added an estimated $2.5 million per day to trucking costs because of delays and additional fuel, according to <a href="https://arizonatrucking.com/2015/07/i-10-bridge-closure-costing-trucking-industry-an-additional-2-5-million-a-day/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the American Transportation Research Institute</a>. Such bridge closures are projected to increase significantly across the country over the coming decade, engineers said.</p><p>“With a lot of these bridge closures, trucks have to reroute far more than normal. It adds anywhere from 15 to 100 miles per trip, when a trucking trip typically costs about $91 per hour,” said Dan Murray, senior vice president of the American Transportation Research Institute. “And it becomes very inflationary. We’re buying the same goods and the unexpected costs get passed on to consumers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Mill Street Bridge in Plainfield, Vt., was swept away after heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Beryl in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ted Shaffrey/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Construction this summer on the General John Stark Memorial Bridge between Hinsdale, N.H., and Brattleboro, Vt..

When it closed for a day <a href="https://www.thenorthwestern.com/story/news/local/2024/06/17/interstate-41-closure-in-oshkosh-comes-after-high-heat/74131171007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in June</a> after heat caused a joint in the approach to the bridge to expand, Mr. Minor said that the added detour and traffic meant that he made fewer deliveries and used more fuel.</p><p>“The bridge is on an interstate but the detour is country highways, so you’re driving through little towns going 25 miles an hour,” he said.</p><p>The Biden administration has sought to address the problem. The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law allotted $110 billion for repair and construction of roads, bridges and other major transportation projects. The law included a pioneering program, PROTECT, that provides $7.3 billion divided among states to make facilities and highways more resilient to extreme weather. Another $1.4 billion in competitive grants is also available.</p><p>In Vermont, where heavy rainfall and heat have combined to damage an estimated 100 bridges over the past two years, the state is rebuilding them higher and wider, with deeper foundations and sturdier materials. And waterways below bridges are being made deeper and wider to be able to absorb more water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But that all takes money and time. It is costing Vermont 30 to 40 percent more to build a more flood resistant bridge, said Jeremy Reed, chief engineer at the state transportation agency.</p><p>Scientists, engineers and government agencies are only now beginning to develop standards for how to build climate resilient bridges, said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “We’re learning from the events that are being thrown at us, and trying to change and build for what climate change throws next, but it’s a moving target,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hussam Mahmoud, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Colorado State University and author of the PLOS One study.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eli Imadali for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2018, Colorado became one of the first states to consider the effects of climate change as it planned its roads and bridges. After a 2013 flood <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/us/after-flood-colorado-communities-face-difficult-recovery.html" title="">damaged roughly 500 miles of road</a> and 50 bridges in the state, requiring more than $700 million in emergency repairs, the state transportation commission <a href="https://climate.colorado.gov/colorado-resiliency-framework#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20the%20Transportation%20Commission,about%20transportation%20assets%20and%20operations." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required climate resilience</a> in bridge and road construction.</p><p>The state asked Hussam Mahmoud, a civil engineer and professor at Colorado State University, to examine increased deterioration and stress in the joints of the state’s steel bridges. “What we saw was drastic,” Dr. Mahmoud said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For decades, bridge surfaces have been zippered together with fork-teethed expansion joints, embedded into steel and pavement to accommodate normal swelling and contraction with heat and cold.</p><p>But because of extreme spikes in heat linked to climate change, the joints were swelling more, and more frequently, said Dr. Mahmoud. The problem worsened as overheated joints expanded tightly around the highway debris that typically collects between them. “Once this happens, the bridge can become permanently damaged,” he said. “The steel deforms and twists, the deck cracks, and moisture goes through it and it causes corrosion.”</p><p>Swollen joints cause other problems. Steel bridges are designed to gently bend to accommodate heavy loads, but clogged joints keep beams stiff, failing to spread out the load from large trucks.</p><p>“That means the beams in the bridge are carrying much more weight than they were designed for,” Dr. Mahmoud said.</p><p>Age is usually one of the best predictors of bridge fragility. Engineers generally prioritize bridges for repair and replacement once they are past 50 years old.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>So Dr. Mahmoud was surprised to find that some Colorado bridges in the worst shape included an <a href="https://data.jconline.com/bridge/colorado/morgan/county-road-w-over-riverside-canal/08-MGW-0.7-21/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">18-year-old-bridge</a> over Riverside Canal in Morgan County, a <a href="https://data.coloradoan.com/bridge/colorado/pueblo/county-road-501-over-dry-wash/08-PUCO%202.85-501BR/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">29-year old bridge</a> on County Road 501 through Pueblo County, and a <a href="https://data.citizen-times.com/bridge/colorado/otero/county-road-17-over-otero-canal/08-OT-17-16-28-66A/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10-year-old bridge</a> on County Road 17 over the Otero Canal in Otero County.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bridge over the Otero Canal in Colorado, one of the newer bridges cited by Dr. Mahmoud as being in the worst shape.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eli Imadali for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The bridge on County Road 501 through Pueblo County in Colorado, is 29 years old.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eli Imadali for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>All of these bridges were deemed in “good” or “satisfactory” condition by the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inventory based on inspections between 2020 and 2022.</p><p>Colorado transportation officials say that, while they now take such research into account as they prioritize what bridges to repair, the state doesn’t have the funding for all those improvements. Under the infrastructure law, the state receives <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/bridge_5year_funding_by_state.cfm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$45 million a year in federal funds for bridge repair</a> and is getting $98 million a year from the PROTECT program to help make all of its infrastructure more climate resilient, both through 2026.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>State officials estimate that Colorado probably needs more than five times as much annually. “Realistically, we know that’s not going to happen,” said William Johnson, who leads climate resilience programs for the Colorado Department of Transportation. “We can’t replace everything tomorrow to be more resilient, but we are building climate change into the process.”</p><p>Dr. Mahmoud expanded his research across the country, using details from the National Bridge Inventory to model the impact of climate change on the beams, decks and girders of 80,000 steel bridges. He found the bridges most at risk were in the Northern Rockies and Plains, the upper Midwest, the Ohio Valley and the South. He also found that smaller bridges, with smaller beams, were more vulnerable to damage, since they are already made to accommodate lighter loads.</p><p>The bridges in Dr. Mahmoud’s database include 1,357 steel bridges in Oklahoma and 575 bridges in North Dakota, among them a <a href="https://data.coloradoan.com/bridge/north-dakota/traill/county-highway-over-north-branch-goose-river/38-000000049103020/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">25-year-old bridge</a> over the North Branch Goose River in Traill County, N.D., a <a href="https://data.usatoday.com/bridge/north-dakota/grand-forks/county-highway-over-creek/38-000000018122080/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">16-year-old bridge</a> on a county highway through Grand Forks County, N.D., and an <a href="https://data.livingstondaily.com/bridge/oklahoma/grant/e0220-over-creek/40-309560000000000/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">11-year-old bridge</a> on E0220 road in Grant County, Okla.</p><p>“These bridges in these states were designed according to code,” said Dr. Mahmoud.

The state receives about $45 million a year from the PROTECT program, he said, “but I wouldn’t say we use that money to address any sort of climate change, because I can’t say we’re really seeing that.”</p><p>Tim Gatz, deputy director of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, said cold as well as heat can stress roads and bridges. “We have always had a very wide range of weather conditions,” he said. “Sometimes extreme cold and sometimes extreme heat.”</p><p>Studies show that climate change has caused more rapid shifts between extreme heat and cold, said Royce Floyd, a professor of engineering at the University of Oklahoma. Those seesawing temperatures can cause pavement to squeeze from both sides onto a span, forcing the road and steel to buckle or crack, or even pushing steel beams out of alignment, Dr. Floyd found.</p><p>That’s what happened to at least three major bridges in Oklahoma in recent years, he said. The bridges have since been repaired — without taking into account studies that show the current and future impacts of climate change. But failing to make them hardier means that the buckling could return, Dr. Floyd said.</p><p>“If you don’t plan for climate change then you’re going to end up with the same problems again,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Coral Davenport covers energy and environment policy, with a focus on climate change, for The Times.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
