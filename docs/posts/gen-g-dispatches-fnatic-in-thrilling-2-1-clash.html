<p>These two teams&#39; only previous <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/348466/fnatic-vs-gen-g-champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai-ubqf" target="_blank">matchup</a> was one year ago at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a>. Under nearly identical circumstances, FNATIC drew the last pick out of the first seeds for the playoff draw and were forced to select a white-hot Gen.G that went on to win the entire tournament. </p>

<p>Coming into this match, Gen.G dominated their games in the Swiss stage, with four of their players <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/stats/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025?exclude=31914&amp;min_rounds=0&amp;agent=all" target="_blank">ranking</a> in the top five by rating and the team as a whole dropping only 20 rounds across four maps. </p>

<p>“The team that will be facing us is an unlucky one,” <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2489/munchkin">
		Munchkin	</a>
</span> said in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGFTFPSYpU4" target="_blank">pre-match teaser</a>.</p>

<p>But as <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/438/boaster">
		Boaster	</a>
</span> put it, “FNATIC 2025 is a bit of a different gravy.” The last bastions of EMEA would serve as Gen.G&#39;s biggest challenge yet, having lied in wait for almost a month after their undefeated regional playoff run. </p>

<p>The series kicked off on Gen.G&#39;s map pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498624/fnatic-vs-gen-g-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubqf/?game=221156&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>, pitting their distinctive Viper composition against FNATIC&#39;s signature Yoru-Iso. FNATIC was in control throughout their defense half, going up 8-4 off the back of proactive pushes and clean retakes. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span> showed no signs of nerves in his first international match, racking up 16 kills. </p>

<p>Gen.G quickly pulled the score back to 8-8 with a bonus conversion. With momentum back on their side, Munchkin had a clear read on FNATIC&#39;s movements around the map, finding multiple multikills on Viper. However, it was <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/25017/ash">
		Ash	</a>
</span> who made the difference with a crucial 4K to bring Gen.G up 12-10, allowing them to win out the first map 13-11. </p>

 
<p><em>The rookie for Gen.G collects four when his team needs it the most.</em></p>

<p>Next was FNATIC&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498624/fnatic-vs-gen-g-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubqf/?game=221157&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>, where Gen.G surprised with a composition featuring Neon, Deadlock, and the first Tejo pick of the event following his recent nerfs. Seizing the initiative, they overwhelmed FNATIC with aggressive site hits and rock-solid postplant utility. <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4/crashies">
		crashies	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span> secured a couple of rounds through individual brilliance, but that was all FNATIC could get as Gen.G ended the half with a 9-3 lead.</p>

<p>Down but never out, FNATIC started the second half by handing Gen.G their first pistol round loss of the event. A 1v3 from <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9196/t3xture">
		t3xture	</a>
</span> to get Gen.G up to 12-7 appeared as though it would be the nail in the coffin. Instead, FNATIC dug in their heels, winning five rounds in a row by narrow margins to force overtime, eventually taking Split 14-12 in one of the most exciting maps of the tournament thus far. <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> came alive, spearheading the comeback on Raze and ending the map with 28 kills, 196 ADR, and seven first kills.</p>

 
<p><em>FNATIC gets every kill they need with just seconds left on the clock.</em></p>

<p>Everything came down to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498624/fnatic-vs-gen-g-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubqf/?game=221158&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a>. Both sides opted for similar compositions, the only difference being <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11600/foxy9">
		Foxy9	</a>
</span>&#39;s Deadlock versus Alfajer&#39;s Cypher. Undeterred by the previous map, Gen.G completely outclassed FNATIC on Sunset, dropping both pistols but winning both eco rounds to close out the series with a commanding 13-6 victory.</p>

 
<p><em>t3xture&#39;s Operator was too much for FNATIC to handle.</em></p>

<p>t3xture dominated on defense, getting 16 kills in the first half and leading Gen.G to an 8-4 lead. On the other side, Foxy9 was the headliner on attack, getting 13 kills of his own in just seven rounds. The pair ended the map tied at 21 kills apiece. </p>

<p>With this result, all four of the first seeds in the tournament have lost their opening matches. FNATIC will play an elimination match against RRQ <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498630/rex-regum-qeon-vs-fnatic-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-lr1" target="_blank">tomorrow</a>, with one of the first seeds destined to go home early.</p>

<p>Gen.G, who continue to look like the team to beat, will battle Wolves <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498626/wolves-esports-vs-gen-g-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubsf" target="_blank">on Monday</a>. </p>

<p>“We&#39;re going to win no matter what, and no matter who we face,” Munchkin said of Wolves in the post-match interview. “They&#39;ve played some fun matches, but let&#39;s see if they can do the same thing against us.”</p>
