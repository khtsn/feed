    <h1>Who Are Nihon Hidankyo and the Hibakusha of Japan?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some 200,000 people were killed when U.S. forces dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the summer of 1945, leveling large swaths of both Japanese cities. But many more survived, some with life-changing injuries, others bearing the terrible emotional scars of the devastation and death they had witnessed.</p><p>Those survivors became known as “hibakusha,” which translates as “bomb-affected people.”</p><p>Japan recognized about 650,000 survivors in the wake of the war, but as the decades pass, the number still living has dwindled, and many of those who remain are now in their 80s. About 114,000 are still alive, according to Nihon Hidankyo, the grass-roots organization that received the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.</p><p>Many of the survivors have dedicated their lives to recounting their stories of loss and excruciating physical and emotional injury. Their powerful testimony has contributed to a broader understanding of the profound devastation of nuclear war. This year, The New York Times’s Opinion section <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/06/opinion/hiroshima-nagasaki-atomic-bombing.html" title="">wrote about the survivors</a>.</p><p>Nihon Hidankyo, established 11 years after the end of World War II, began as an organization representing the survivors of the atomic bomb who continued to suffer not only the physical effects of radiation but also the social stigma associated with the war.</p></div></div>
