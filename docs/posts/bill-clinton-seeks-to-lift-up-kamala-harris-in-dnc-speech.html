Two days ago, I turned 78, the oldest man in my family of four generations. And the only personal vanity I want to assert is I’m still younger than Donald Trump. In 2024, we got a pretty clear choice, it seems to me. Kamala Harris for the people. And the other guy who’s proved even more than the first go-round that he’s about me, myself and I. So the next time you hear him, don’t count the lies. Count the “I”s. He’s like one of those tenors opening up before he walks out on stage like I did, trying to get his lungs open by singing, “me, me, me, me, me.” When Kamala Harris is president, every day will begin with “you, you, you, you.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/21/multimedia/21election-live-takeaways-clinton-video-cover-ktgq/21election-live-takeaways-clinton-video-cover-ktgq-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Former President Bill Clinton portrayed Donald J.

Democrats had just anointed a nominee to become the first woman ever elected president. They faced a Republican opponent they considered a buffoon. And they felt optimistic about victory.</p><p>But eight years after his front-running wife, Hillary Clinton, was upset by Donald J. Trump, Mr. Clinton warned Democrats not to make the same mistake as Vice President Kamala Harris takes on the same opponent. Joy is great, but it does not necessarily win elections. Polls are fickle. Energy is no guarantee of victory. Complacency could lead to catastrophe.</p><p>“We’ve seen more than one election slip away from us when we thought it couldn’t happen, when people got distracted by phony issues or overconfident,” Mr. Clinton told the thousands of delegates at the United Center in Chicago. “This is a brutal, tough business. I want you to be happy. One of the reasons that President-to-Be Harris is doing so well is that we’re all so happy.</p><p>“But you should never underestimate your adversary,” he continued, departing from the prepared text distributed in advance, “and these people are really good at distracting us, at triggering doubt, at triggering buyer’s remorse. As the Obamas said so eloquently last night, they are human, you know, they’re bound to make a mistake now and then,” he added, referring to Ms. Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. “We’ve got to be tough.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Clinton did not explicitly mention his wife or 2016 or the various factors that cost them that election, but he did not need to. The delegates got it. As impressive as Ms. Harris’s debut on the campaign trail has been and as jubilant as the Democrats gathered in Chicago have felt, the 2024 election is still a margin-of-error affair.</p><p>Indeed, while Ms. Harris has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/us/elections/kamala-harris-trump-az-nc-ga-nv.html" title="">surged in polls</a> beyond where President Biden was before he dropped out, she is still not doing as well against Mr. Trump as Mrs. Clinton was after her own nomination, at least not yet.</p><p>At a convention bursting with new-generation vibes, it fell to Mr. Clinton to be the voice of old-generation experience. No one taking the stage this week has had more prime time at the convention microphone, though his raspy voice was no longer at its peak.</p><p>His speech on Wednesday was his 12th before a Democratic convention, a record of rhetoric that reflects the larger story of Mr. Clinton’s political life. It has been a tale of boom and bust and boom again that has made him one of the most enduring figures of the modern era. In those dozen speeches, he has gone from young rising star to tiresome bloviator to dynamic presidential nominee to popular incumbent to scandal-tarred lame duck to candidate’s husband to wise elder statesman.</p><p>So perhaps it was not surprising that he still takes the whole convention exercise pretty seriously. In fact, according to a person familiar with the process, Mr. Clinton scrapped his draft speech for this week’s convention on Monday night after watching the proceedings of the first day and started over again.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The person, who was granted anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes preparations, said Mr. Clinton concluded that, in the spirit of Mario Cuomo, the New York governor who gave the keynote address at the 1984 convention, he needed more poetry, not prose. The former president was also struck by the palpable energy of the convention hall and felt compelled to take it into account.</p><p>Even then, he was not satisfied to stick with the text turned into convention officials three hours before airtime and fed into the teleprompter. Allotted 12 minutes, according to a schedule that made its way to the media, Mr. Clinton unsurprisingly spoke for 27 minutes, extemporizing and embroidering as he went along. Unlike Ms. Harris, he said, Mr. Trump was only about “me, myself and I.”</p><p>“What does her opponent do with his voice?” Mr. Clinton asked. “He mostly talks about himself, right? So the next time you hear him, don’t count the lies, count the I’s. Count the I’s. His vendettas, his vengeance, his complaints, his conspiracies — he’s like one of those tenors opening up before he walks out onstage, like I did, trying to get his lungs open by singing, ‘me, me, me, me, me, me.’ When Kamala Harris is president, every day will begin with you, you, you, you.”</p><p>Mr. Clinton summoned some of the familiar oldies, calling himself “the man from Hope,” referring to the small town in Arkansas where he was born, and joking about his once-famous predilection for fast food.</p><p>Noting that Ms. Harris worked at McDonald’s as a young woman, he said, “I’ll be so happy when she actually enters the White House as president because she will break my record as the president who spent the most time at McDonald’s.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Clinton, who turned 78 on Monday, noted with some satisfaction that he is “still younger than Donald Trump” (who turned 78 two months ago), but to some extent he is a product of another era. His brand of moderate politics reshaped the Democratic Party in the 1990s from a perennial loser to the party that would go on to win the national popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections.</p><p>But welfare-reforming, free-trading, budget-balancing centrism is not in vogue in today’s Democratic Party, where progressive politics are more resonant. Moreover, Mr. Clinton’s history of sexual indiscretions — and allegations of even worse, although denied — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/us/politics/bill-clinton-sexual-misconduct-debate.html" title="">look different in light of the #MeToo movement</a> of recent years. In that sense, his presence may appear somewhat discordant at a convention devoted to electing the first woman president.</p><p>Still, it is also a convention about generational torch-passing, and Democrats hoped that Mr. Clinton’s speech would help validate Ms. Harris, 59, particularly with working-class white swing voters in Midwestern and Sun Belt states who remember the 42nd president fondly and are not yet sure whether to make her the 47th.</p><p>Mr. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-dnc-harris.html" title="">addressed the convention on Monday</a>, were not among the Democrats who pressured Mr. Biden to withdraw as a candidate after the president’s disastrous June debate with Mr. Trump. In fact, in the tumultuous days that followed, the Clintons urged angry party donors to keep giving, a move that earned Mr. Biden’s gratitude. But the Clintons were also quick to endorse Ms. Harris the moment Mr. Biden stepped aside.</p><p>Mr. Clinton has attended every Democratic convention since 1972 and briefly spoke in 1976 when he was asked to say a few words of praise for former President Harry S. Truman. He gave his first real speech in 1980 just days before his 34th birthday, when he was governor of Arkansas. But his long-winded address in 1988 dragged on for so long that convention officials flashed the words “Please. Your time is up.” on the teleprompter screen and his best applause line turned out to be <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4893699/clinton-convention-speech-in-closing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“in closing.”</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Clinton went on to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/17/news/the-party-s-over-bill-clinton-democratic-team-opens-by-appealing-to-middle-class.html" title="">win the party’s nomination</a> and the presidency in 1992. He addressed conventions again in 1996, when he vowed to use a second term to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/30/us/clinton-declaring-hope-is-back-defends-his-first-term-and-lists-plans-for-second.html" title="">“build a bridge to the 21st century,”</a> and in 2000, when he sought to repair his reputation after his sex-and-lies impeachment stemming from an affair with a White House intern. By 2012, he had achieved a more senior role in the party, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/us/politics/clinton-delivers-stirring-plea-for-obama-second-term.html" title="">his articulate speech</a> prompted President Barack Obama to dub him the “secretary of explaining stuff.”</p><p>“I have no idea how many more of these I’ll be able to come to,” Mr. Clinton said somberly as he wrapped up on Wednesday night. He noted that he had been coming since 1976, then corrected himself to say 1972. “Lord, I’m getting old,” he said, chagrined.</p><p>But Mr. Clinton delivered the message he was sent out to deliver: “Take it from a man who once had the honor to be called in this convention the man from Hope: We need Kamala Harris, the president of joy, to lead us.”</p><p>And then he headed offstage to the tune of his old campaign anthem, Fleetwood Mac’s “Don’t Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow),” while many in the hall thought about his many yesterdays.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
