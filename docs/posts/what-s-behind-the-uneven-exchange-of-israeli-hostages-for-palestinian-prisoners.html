The truce prompted celebrations on both sides of the border and hope for an end to a devastating 15-month war.</p><p>The exchanges, which returned three women to Israel and 90 mostly women and minors to the West Bank, were the first of a series of hostage-for-prisoner swaps set to take place over the course of a fragile 42-day truce. If it were to hold, Hamas would return 33 of the roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/middleeast/what-we-know-hostage-release.html" title="">100 remaining Israeli hostages</a> still in Gaza, living and dead. And Israel would release more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/middleeast/palestine-prisoners-release-israel-hamas-ceasefire.html" title="">1,000 Palestinians</a> from its prisons and jails.</p><div><p>Al Jazeera, the Qatar-funded Arabic broadcaster, streamed footage of Red Cross buses ferrying freed Palestinians out of Ofer prison near Jerusalem after midnight on Monday.</p><p>Earlier, videos released by the Israeli military showed the three women released on Sunday — identified as <a href="#hostages-emily-tamari-doron-steinbrecher-romi-gonen" title="">Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher</a> — walking under their own power as they were handed over from the Red Cross to Israeli troops, and then having emotional reunions with their families at an Israeli hospital. One hostage, Ms. Damari, has a bandaged left hand, and in a photo later posted online by the military, she appears to have lost two fingers.</p><p>As the truce took effect on Sunday morning, joyful Palestinians honked car horns and blasted music in the central Gaza city of Deir al Balah, where celebratory gunfire rang out and children ran around in the streets. Within minutes, aid packed onto trucks began to flow through border crossings into the territory.</p><p>And as Israeli officers said their forces had begun to withdraw from parts of Gaza, including two towns north of Gaza City, Hamas sought to signal that it was still standing and moving to reassert control in the territory, with masked gunmen taking to the streets in cities devastated by months of war.</p><p>Achieving the agreement on a delicate, multistage cease-fire required months of talks mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. The start of an initial, six-week phase on Sunday was delayed by almost three hours, to 11:15 a.m. local time, after Israel said it had not formally received the names of the first three hostages to be released. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire/israeli-attacks-continued-during-a-nearly-three-hour-delay-in-the-cease-fire?smid=url-share" title="">During the delay</a>, the Israeli military continued striking targets in Gaza.</p><p>Here’s what we’re covering:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hostage and prisoner releases: </strong>As the Gaza cease-fire took hold, one aspect of the agreement was strikingly lopsided: the number of Israeli hostages released compared with the number of freed Palestinian prisoners. Further exchanges will likely follow a similar (and familiar) formula, with tens of Palestinians freed from prisons in Israel for each hostage held in the Gaza Strip. <a href="#whats-behind-the-uneven-exchange-of-israeli-hostages-for-palestinian-prisoners" title="">Read more ›</a></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Hamas reasserts control:</strong> Armed Hamas fighters returned to the streets of Gaza on Sunday, and the Hamas-run police force, whose uniformed officers had all but disappeared to avoid Israeli attacks, said that it was deploying personnel across the territory to “preserve security and order,” according to the government media office. <a href="#hamas-in-charge-gaza" title="">Read more ›</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s destruction:</strong> The start of the cease-fire halted a 470-day war that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 others, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Much of Gaza has been destroyed, and most of its roughly two million people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/26/world/middleeast/gaza-south-displaced-damage.html" title="">have been displaced</a> at least once by the war. “The weight on my chest has lifted,” said Ziad Obeid, a Gazan civil servant displaced several times during the war. “We have survived.” <a href="#gaza-israel-mood" title="">Read more ›</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Humanitarian aid:</strong> United Nations trucks carrying humanitarian supplies began entering Gaza just 15 minutes after the cease-fire took effect, according to Jonathan Whittall, the head of the U.N. humanitarian office for the Palestinian territories. The cease-fire deal calls for 600 trucks to be allowed to bring aid to Gazans daily, although it was not clear how the supplies would be distributed. <a href="#aid-trucks-began-moving-into-gaza-as-part-of-the-cease-fire-deal" title="">Read more ›</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Next phase:</strong> Israel and Hamas reached the cease-fire agreement in part by putting off their most intractable disputes until a nebulous “second phase” that neither side is sure it will reach. At the end of the 42-day truce, Hamas will still have around two-thirds of the 98 remaining hostages, including dozens who are believed to be dead. And Israel will still occupy parts of Gaza and hold high-profile prisoners. The Israeli government will then likely have to choose whether it is willing to choose one of its war aims, bringing home the hostages, over another, destroying Hamas. <a href="#israel-hamas-cease-fire-next-steps" title="">Read more ›</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="55" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZmI0OTRmMjYtMDRkYi01OGY4LTk2N2ItZWM1ZDNmYzY3NzNi"><div id="fb494f26-04db-58f8-967b-ec5d3fc6773b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire#fb494f26-04db-58f8-967b-ec5d3fc6773b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/fatima-abdulkarim"><img alt="Fatima AbdulKarim" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-20T01:31:45.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 8:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Khalida Jarrar, a leader in the left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was released by Israel on early Monday. She was handed a coat to drape over her gray jumpsuit as she stepped off the Red Cross bus and was quickly surrounded by her husband and friends. Jarrar was immediately taken to a hospital in Ramallah for a medical check-up before heading home. Among her first requests was a cup of coffee with extra sugar, just the way she likes it, said her friend, Nadia AlBajjeh.

Over the six-week first phase of the truce, Hamas is expected to release 33 captives and Israel is slated to free about 1,900 Palestinians.</p><div><p>Such an uneven swap is not unusual. Israeli governments have long been determined to bring back captured civilians and soldiers, including dead ones, even at steep costs. The terms of such trades have often prompted fierce criticism domestically, much as a hostage release deal in November 2023 — part of an earlier cease-fire — did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/middleeast/truce-israel-dispute-hamas.html" title="">within Israel’s governing coalition</a>.</p><p>The exchange of civilian hostages for prisoners, including some whom Israel has accused of terrorism, has also raised the ire of some Israelis. In a statement celebrating the release of the three Israeli hostages on Sunday, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, hinted at some of that underlying frustration, saying the latest trade was not “a true like-for-like exchange.”</p><p>Two of the women were abducted from their homes and one from a music festival, and “then brutally held since,” he said. “This is a huge difference when compared to the terrorists who are being released.”</p><p>Hamas officials have said one of the objectives of the group’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel was to win the release of some of the thousands of Palestinians jailed in Israel, many of them accused of violence against Israeli soldiers and civilians. Many Palestinians say such violence is legitimate resistance to Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank and repeated military campaigns in Gaza. And many are also critical of Israel’s justice system, which they say falsely imprisons some Palestinians, including women and children.</p><p>Yahya Sinwar, the former political chief of Hamas, who was an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war, was intimately familiar with the formulas Israel has accepted in previous exchanges. He had spent years in an Israeli prison but was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/world/middleeast/israel-and-palestinians-begin-prisoner-exchange.html" title="">released in October 2011</a> along with more than 1,000 others as part of an exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid in 2006.</p><p>Upon his release in 2011, Mr. Sinwar pledged “to work hard to free all prisoners, especially those who serve high sentences, whatever the price.” At the time, the lopsided trade raised questions of whether the exchange would encourage more abductions of Israelis.</p><p>Israeli troops killed Mr. Sinwar three months ago in fighting in Gaza.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians overlooking Ofer prison ahead of the prisoners’ release, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laura Boushnak for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>There were also earlier precedents for uneven trades. In 2003, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/10/world/in-close-vote-israeli-cabinet-backs-trade-of-prisoners.html" title="">exchanged</a> a kidnapped former Israeli colonel and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers killed during a cross-border raid for more than 400 prisoners held in Israel and nearly 60 bodies.</p><p>Almost two decades earlier, in 1985, the Israeli government traded more than 1,100 prisoners — including some convicted of perpetrating or masterminding attacks on Israelis — for three Israeli soldiers captured during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Some of the released prisoners eventually became senior militant leaders.</p><p>During the last cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, a one-week truce in November 2023, Israel released roughly three prisoners — women and minors — for each hostage returned to Israel. Ultimately, Hamas freed about 100 hostages — including more than 20 who were not Israeli and were not included in the deal with Israel — in exchange for about 240 prisoners held by Israel.</p><p>The ratio frustrated some critics in Israel, including some relatives of hostages, while other captives’ family members have demanded that Israel pay any price to bring people back. When Israeli soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/15/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news" title="">accidentally killed three hostages</a> in Gaza who had escaped their captors, Itzik Horn, whose adult sons were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, said Israel must immediately reach a deal to free all the captives, even if it means releasing Palestinians held in Israeli jails on terrorism charges.</p><p>“Let them free all the Palestinian prisoners we have here, all the terrorists — what do I care?” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/16/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news?smid=url-share#israel-hostage-killings-families-hamas" title="">Mr. Horn said more than a year ago</a>. “The most important thing isn’t to defeat Hamas. The only victory here is to bring back all the hostages.” Mr. Horn’s sons are still being held captive.</p><p>The families of hostages are split over this and other issues; a small minority have opposed a deal. The Tikva Forum, an Israeli group representing some captives’ families, opposed the latest cease-fire agreement. In a statement on Wednesday, when news of the deal emerged, the group said <a href="https://x.com/tikvaforumENG/status/1879615196748202032" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> on social media that it objected to an agreement with Hamas, which it called “a terror organization that should be destroyed.”</p><p>“This deal leaves dozens of hostages behind in Gaza,” the group said. “It also sets the stage for the next massacre and future kidnappings of Israelis.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="45" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOWE3NjA5YjYtOWQ4NC01Nzk5LThjM2MtNDRjZWM3MjJjYmQ4"><div id="9a7609b6-9d84-5799-8c3c-44cec722cbd8" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire#9a7609b6-9d84-5799-8c3c-44cec722cbd8"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nadav-gavrielov"><img alt="Nadav Gavrielov" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/05/sports/author-nadav-gavrielov/author-nadav-gavrielov-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/05/sports/author-nadav-gavrielov/author-nadav-gavrielov-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/05/sports/author-nadav-gavrielov/author-nadav-gavrielov-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T20:45:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 3:45 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Video released by the Israeli government <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_qELjvLED8&amp;ab_channel=IsraeliPM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showed</a> the three hostages who returned from Gaza being reunited with members of their families at Sheba Hospital in Israel.

But in Ramallah, the West Bank city that is home to many of those imprisoned by Israel, the mood was uneasy.</p><div><p>“The people are too exhausted, and their feelings are mixed with sorrow over Gaza,” said one taxi driver, Zuhair Yousef. “So we are waiting until the last minute.”</p><p>Under the first phase of the deal, Hamas agreed to release 33 of the hostages it seized in Israel during its Oct. 7, 2023 attack. In return, Israel said it would free 1,000 Palestinians being held in Israel.</p><p>Early Sunday, after the cease-fire took effect, Hamas began releasing its captives, allowing three women to be taken back to Israel and reunited with their families. Israel, in turn, was expected to release 90 Palestinian women and minors from its prisons on Sunday night.</p><p>Hostage families in Israel awaiting more releases were anxious lest something go wrong. Palestinians in the West Bank said they, too, feared 11th-hour problems as they waited for the first batch of prisoners to be freed.</p><p>“The release can be stalled for any reason,” Mr. Yousef said.</p><p>At a cafe in Ramallah, Mohammad al-Khatib, the director of a food factory, sat with his father watching Al Jazeera news as hookah smoke curled around them. They lifted their head when the screen showed video from Ofer Prison, from which Palestinian prisoners were expected to be released.</p><p>“We have been in consecutive pain for 15 months,” said Mr. al-Khatib, 32. He said, “Despite our pain, we are happy for this day,” he said.</p><p>Scores of Palestinians gathered near the prison, many lighting fires for warmth as they waited. Another gathering point was a traffic circle located on the route from the prison to Ramallah. There, dozens raised Palestinian flags alongside those of Hamas and other groups.</p><p>Ahmad Barghouti, 25, a lawyer, stood at the roundabout with friends and relatives, waiting for buses carrying the released prisoners. His imprisoned uncle, also named Ahmad Barghouti, is an adviser to another relative, Marwan Barghouti, a prominent Palestinian leader who has been in Israeli prisons for more than 20 years.</p><p>“This is a moment of joy we desperately need,” he said. Mr. Barghouti said he hoped his uncle would be released in the coming weeks under the swap deal.</p><p>It was not just apprehension that explained the subdued mood among West Bank Palestinians. Families of the prisoners have been warned by the Israeli government, which controls the West Bank, against any form of public celebration.</p><p>“This may have affected people,” Mr. al-Khatib said, “but we will for sure receive them in a very suitable and respectful manner.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="40" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYzczNDFkM2EtNDYxZi01ZDA0LWJmYzktZTk5NjQ3OWJkOGQ3"><div id="c7341d3a-461f-5d04-bfc9-e996479bd8d7" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire#c7341d3a-461f-5d04-bfc9-e996479bd8d7"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni"><img alt="Ephrat Livni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T18:32:23.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 1:32 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>“The vast majority” of the 33 hostages to be released in the six-week first phase of the cease-fire are alive, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt.

By sending its fighters out in an unmistakable show of force, Hamas was trying to deliver an unequivocal message to Palestinians in Gaza, to Israel and to the international community: that despite heavy losses during the war among Hamas’s fighters, police officers, political leaders and government administrators, it remains the dominant Palestinian power in Gaza.</p><p>“The message is that Hamas is ‘the day after’ for the war,” said Ibrahim Madhoun, an analyst close to Hamas based in Turkey, using a phrase that refers to the future administration of Gaza.</p><div><p>“They’re conveying that Hamas must be a part of any future arrangements, or at least, be coordinated with,” he added.</p><p>On Sunday, the Hamas-run government media office announced that thousands of police officers were beginning to deploy throughout the territory to “preserve security and order.” Government ministries and institutions, the media office said, were prepared to start working “according to the government plan to implement all the measures that guarantee bringing back normal life.”</p><p>At the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern city of Khan Younis, at least three uniformed police officers were standing as the Palestinian national anthem played in the background, according to a video posted on social media and verified by The New York Times.</p><p>Later on Sunday, dozens of uniformed, gun-toting Hamas militants were seen in Saraya Square in Gaza City next to a car holding Israeli hostages before they were handed over to the Red Cross. The militants were attempting to push away crowds of people pressing toward the car.</p><p>Even as Hamas attempts to project that it still controls Gaza and plans to play a key role in its administration, its future there remains uncertain. Israeli officials have said they have not given up on their stated war goal of dismantling Hamas’s military wing and government, strongly suggesting that they could resume the war against the militant group after the freeing of some hostages.</p><p>Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, said on Sunday that Hamas’s rule was dangerous for Israel’s security and emphasized that Israel had not agreed to a permanent cease-fire that leaves Hamas in power.</p><p>“We are determined to achieve the objectives of the war,” he said.</p><p>While some analysts say Israel could eventually remove Hamas from power, others say it would struggle to resume the war in the face of international pressure. And even if it does, those analysts say, Israeli forces will face immense challenges in uprooting Hamas from Gaza without carrying out a direct occupation.</p><p>Ali Jarbawi, a political science professor at Birzeit University, said Hamas’s parades through Gaza on Sunday were more than a message to the international community that it was in control. They also reflect the reality on the ground, he said.</p><p>“Hamas was there before the war and they’re there now,” he said.</p><p>Aritz Parra<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzUyMTZlMzMwLTZmNDYtNWQyYy1hZjNmLTkyNGJmZGZiNzk1MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire#israel-hostage-families" data-source-id="100000009935897"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/natan-odenheimer"><img alt="Natan Odenheimer" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T16:32:45.413Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 11:32 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israelis gathered in a square in Tel Aviv to watch the release of the hostages on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As hundreds of people gathered in a Tel Aviv plaza on Sunday to cheer the news that the first three hostages released in the cease-fire deal were being returned to Israel, for some families, an agonizing wait goes on.</p><p>The initial stage of the cease-fire called for the release on Sunday of three hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7.

That appeared far from reality on Sunday as Hamas militants, some waving rifles, fanned out in parts of Gaza in pickup trucks, in a show of authority to Palestinians and Israelis alike.</p><p>Israel and Hamas have both preserved some of their bargaining chips. At the end of the 42-day truce, Hamas will still have around two-thirds of the 98 remaining hostages, including dozens who are believed to be dead. And Israel will still occupy parts of Gaza, and hold major prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure.</p><p>But as part of the talks, the Israeli government will then probably have to decide whether it is willing to choose one of its war aims, bringing home the hostages, over another, destroying Hamas. And choosing the hostages might threaten Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s grip on power in Israel.</p><p>In the meantime, both sides have agreed to postpone a decisive agreement as to the war’s end and the future of Gaza, and hope the 42-day cease-fire will play to their advantage, said Shlomo Brom, a retired Israeli brigadier general. Hamas, in particular, “hopes that the new dynamic will prevent Israel from returning to fighting,” he said.</p><p>The decision to accept a temporary cease-fire opened deep fissures within Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, which is stacked with hard-liners. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, resigned in protest from the cabinet and withdrew his Jewish Power party from the coalition on Sunday.</p><p>The Religious Zionism party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, threatened to bolt the coalition, too, if Mr. Netanyahu failed to renew the fighting after the end of the 42-day truce. If Mr. Smotrich’s party also left, Mr. Netanyahu’s government would hold fewer than half of the seats in the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, which could cause the government to fall and force new elections.</p><p>On Saturday night, Mr. Netanyahu stressed that the cease-fire was temporary for now. He argued that Israel retained the right to return to the war if “the second stage negotiations are ineffectual,” adding that President-elect Donald J. Trump would support Israel’s decision.</p><p>“We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the United States,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised address.</p><p>The truce’s fragility was underscored on Sunday morning when Hamas did not immediately hand over a list of hostages to be released to Israel, prompting a nearly three-hour delay in the cease-fire. Analysts say the deal will probably see numerous similar tests over the next few weeks as both sides flex their muscles.</p><p>The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have called on the Israeli government to bring home the remaining captives by fulfilling all the phases of the deal. Noa Argamani, a freed hostage whose boyfriend, Avinatan Or, remains in captivity, said that it broke her heart that he was not going to be freed in this round.</p><p>“The progress in the past few days is a very important step, but the deal must go through in full, completely, in all of its stages,” Ms. Argamani said in a speech in Miami on Thursday.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Y3NDUzN2RkLWZlYTAtNTk2Ny1iODAwLTE3YmY2MDExOTU5Nw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire#gaza-residents-return" data-source-id="100000009935860"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T14:22:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 9:22 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Gaza’s Civil Defense celebrating in Gaza City on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Issa/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets across Gaza on Sunday, honking car horns and cheering to celebrate the start of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>Other people who had fled south collected any belongings they had and headed north for long awaited journeys back to their homes — or whatever was left of them.

But there was also an overwhelming sense of loss resulting from a conflict that has devastated the territory and its population.</p><p>Many people said they were determined to start to reclaim the lives they had once known despite the huge amount of destruction across the enclave.</p><p>“The joy of returning home is overwhelming, but it’s mixed with sadness,” said Ahed al-Okka, 52.</p><p>A construction worker from Gaza City in the north, Mr. al-Okka said that he has spent most of the past year living in a tent on the streets of a city in central Gaza, Deir al-Balah. He planned to return Sunday to his house, which he had heard was partially damaged but still standing.</p><p>But even if his family could repair a single room and live in it, that would be enough for now, he said: “We’ll rebuild and fix things step by step and finally get some peace of mind.”</p><p>For others, the resolve to rebuild lives disrupted by war was overshadowed by the grief and pain built up over 15 months of conflict.</p><p>“I can’t say I’m happy about this truce,” said Suhaila Dawaas, a 55-year-old mother of eight who was displaced to central Gaza from Beit Lahia in the north. “What is left for us after everything — after the endless losses, the destruction, the pain?”</p><p>Ms. Dawaas said several of her relatives had been killed by Israeli airstrikes. Her home has been mostly destroyed, she said, and she hoped to find a few reminders of the life her family once had in the rubble — maybe in photo albums — when she returns home.</p><p>She said she was grieving for more than what had been lost. She added that she was also grieving for everything still to be lost — her children’s future and the hardships that would undoubtedly define the next chapter in Gaza as people try to rebuild their lives.</p><p>“We spent our entire lives building homes for our children, and now, we have lost so much,” Ms. Dawaas said.

That offers a window for Gazans to take tentative first steps toward reconstruction; to find relatives still buried in the rubble; and to come to terms with the killing of more than 45,000 people, both civilians and combatants, whose bodies have already been counted by the Gazan health authorities. Scenes of joy were broadcast on Sunday from across the territory, as rescue workers threw confetti; crowds danced and chanted amid the rubble; and journalists symbolically removed their flak jackets.</p><p>For Israelis, the deal allows for the gradual release of at least 33 of the hostages captured during Hamas’s raid on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — an attack that killed up to 1,200 people and provoked Israel’s devastating 15-month response. For the hostages released alive, that means freedom after 470 days of captivity. For Israelis at large, many of them wracked by a form of survivors’ guilt, it offers qualified catharsis. In the embodiment of that mood, friends of one of the first three hostages released on Sunday were filmed leaping with jubilation after hearing news of her freedom.</p><p>But the details of the deal between Israel and Hamas mean that both sides still face considerable uncertainty about how the next six weeks will play out, let alone about whether the tentative arrangement will later become permanent. Even the first phase started hours behind schedule on Sunday morning, amid disputes about which hostages would be released in the afternoon. In that time, according to the Gazan authorities, Israeli strikes killed and wounded yet more people.</p><p>For now, Israel also still controls vast tracts of Gaza and has yet to agree to a full withdrawal, preventing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, like Mr. Obeid, from returning to homes in northern Gaza. It remains to be seen whether Israeli troops will ever entirely leave.</p><p>“What happens after 42 days?” Mr. Weissglas said. “Nobody knows.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Palestinians trying to return home on Sunday in northern Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Al-Basos/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Palestinians also remain unclear about the fates of several thousand Gazans detained incommunicado during the war and who may not be released during the upcoming exchanges. Reema Diab, a housewife in central Gaza, still has no way of locating her husband, a horse trainer, who she said was taken for interrogation in Israel in December 2023 and never heard from since.</p><p>“I’m relieved the bloodshed is coming to an end, but my heart aches,” Ms. Diab said. “His absence is unimaginable.”</p><p>Across the border, Israeli columnists struck a somber tone, with one, Ben Caspit, describing a blend of joy and sadness, “inseparably intertwined.” He wrote that Sunday was a day of reckoning, not celebration, and he emphasized that Israel would now need to come to terms with the scale of its failure on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>“Let us be silent for a moment, let us study our conscience, let us suffer the disaster, let us think about those who were killed and murdered and burned and raped and kidnapped,” Mr. Caspit wrote in Maariv, a right-leaning daily newspaper.</p><p>Israelis also feared already for the fates of some 65 hostages who may not be released from Gaza if the deal collapses after six weeks. Similarly, there were widespread fears that the initial 33 hostages set to be released over the next 42 days may be emotionally or physically scarred, or even dead. And Israelis generally lamented that the hostages’ freedom would be obtained in exchange for Palestinian detainees, including some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/middleeast/palestine-prisoners-release-israel-hamas-ceasefire.html" title="">convicted of major terrorist attacks</a> as well as teenagers who have never been charged.</p><p>Palestinians see the soon-to-be released detainees as freedom fighters and political prisoners. For Israelis, it will be a psychological blow to see “this stream of murderers being released,” Mr. Weissglas said.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israelis looking at the ruins of Beit Hanoun, Gaza, from a hill in Sderot, Israel, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Videos of Hamas fighters re-emerging in triumph from hiding were also a gut-punch for Israelis, who had hoped the war would completely destroy the group’s military abilities. For many Gazans, it was a sight to be celebrated, but for others, it was a reminder of lingering uncertainty about Gaza’s future governance.</p><p>Mr. Obeid works for the Palestinian Authority, which lost power to Hamas in Gaza 18 years ago but still employs some Gazan civil servants, including Mr. Obeid, and now hopes to play a bigger role in postwar Gaza. Mr. Obeid said he had been liaising in recent days with the authority’s leaders in the West Bank to plan potential cleanup and reconstruction operations in Gaza. It is unclear, he said, whether those efforts will be possible with Hamas still in charge over the next six weeks, and perhaps even beyond.</p><p>It is also unclear when Israel will allow Mr. Obeid, who fled to Egypt last year after being displaced three times in Gaza, to return home.</p><p>But all of that can be addressed in time, Mr. Obeid said.</p><p>For now, he said, “I can breathe oxygen again.”</p><p>Bilal Shbair<!-- --> contributed reporting from Deir al Balah, Gaza Strip, and <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
