He added that UNRWA teams there had reported “a good first day of the cease-fire.”</p><p>But neither Israel nor Hamas is sure they will reach a <a href="#israel-hamas-cease-fire-next-steps" title="">second phase</a> of the cease-fire that would attempt to resolve more difficult disputes between the two sides — including a final end to the war, the release of the remaining living hostages and the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.</p><p>Displaced Gazans are also unsure what, if anything, they will find when they return to their homes. And after months of restrictions and lawlessness in Gaza that reduced humanitarian aid to a trickle, aid agencies have warned that they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#aid-trucks-began-moving-into-gaza-as-part-of-the-cease-fire-deal" title="">need unimpeded access</a> for supplies to reach those in need.</p><p>Here’s what we’re covering:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Trump inauguration:</strong> Some officials have suggested that a looming deadline helped close the gap to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html" title="">reaching a cease-fire deal</a> after months of sputtering talks: President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration on Monday. That deadline helped negotiators put pressure on both Israel and Hamas to accelerate their decision-making after months of agonizing delay.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reactions on the ground:</strong> As the truce took hold on Sunday, Israelis and Palestinians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-mood.html?smid=url-share" title="">expressed feelings of elation tinged with doubt</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage and prisoner releases: </strong>One aspect of the cease-fire agreement was strikingly lopsided: the number of Israeli hostages released compared with the number of freed Palestinian prisoners. Further exchanges <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire/whats-behind-the-uneven-exchange-of-israeli-hostages-for-palestinian-prisoners?smid=url-share" title="">will likely follow a similar formula</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Hamas projects strength:</strong> Armed Hamas fighters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire?smid=url-share#hamas-in-charge-gaza" title="">returned to the streets of Gaza on Sunday</a>. The Hamas-run police force, whose uniformed officers had all but disappeared to avoid Israeli attacks, said that it was deploying personnel across the territory to “preserve security and order.”.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s destruction:</strong> The cease-fire halted a 470-day conflict that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 others, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Many of Gaza’s roughly two million people have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/26/world/middleeast/gaza-south-displaced-damage.html" title="">displaced at least once by the war</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Next phase:</strong> At the end of the initial six-week truce, Hamas will still have around two-thirds of the remaining hostages, including dozens who are believed to be dead.

Now, it was destroyed.</p><p>Mr. Bahja clambered onto what remained of the roof to look out over the devastated landscape.</p><p>As night fell, they headed back on foot for the apartment in Gaza City where they have been sheltering for the past three months.</p><p>Like some Gazans, Mr. Bahja no longer sees a future for his family in the Palestinian enclave.

Over the six-week first phase of the truce, Hamas is expected to release 33 captives and Israel is slated to free about 1,900 Palestinians.</p><div><p>Such an uneven swap is not unusual. Israeli governments have long been determined to bring back captured civilians and soldiers, including dead ones, even at steep costs. The terms of such trades have often prompted fierce criticism domestically, much as a hostage release deal in November 2023 — part of an earlier cease-fire — did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/middleeast/truce-israel-dispute-hamas.html" title="">within Israel’s governing coalition</a>.</p><p>The exchange of civilian hostages for prisoners, including some whom Israel has accused of terrorism, has also raised the ire of some Israelis. In a statement celebrating the release of the three Israeli hostages on Sunday, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, hinted at some of that underlying frustration, saying the latest trade was not “a true like-for-like exchange.”</p><p>Two of the women were abducted from their homes and one from a music festival, and “then brutally held since,” he said. “This is a huge difference when compared to the terrorists who are being released.”</p><p>Hamas officials have said one of the objectives of the group’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel was to win the release of some of the thousands of Palestinians jailed in Israel, many of them accused of violence against Israeli soldiers and civilians. Many Palestinians say such violence is legitimate resistance to Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank and repeated military campaigns in Gaza. And many are also critical of Israel’s justice system, which they say falsely imprisons some Palestinians, including women and children.</p><p>Yahya Sinwar, the former political chief of Hamas, who was an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war, was intimately familiar with the formulas Israel has accepted in previous exchanges. He had spent years in an Israeli prison but was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/world/middleeast/israel-and-palestinians-begin-prisoner-exchange.html" title="">released in October 2011</a> along with more than 1,000 others as part of an exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid in 2006.</p><p>Upon his release in 2011, Mr. Sinwar pledged “to work hard to free all prisoners, especially those who serve high sentences, whatever the price.” At the time, the lopsided trade raised questions of whether the exchange would encourage more abductions of Israelis.</p><p>Israeli troops killed Mr. Sinwar three months ago in fighting in Gaza.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians overlooking Ofer prison ahead of the prisoners’ release, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laura Boushnak for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>There were also earlier precedents for uneven trades. In 2003, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/10/world/in-close-vote-israeli-cabinet-backs-trade-of-prisoners.html" title="">exchanged</a> a kidnapped former Israeli colonel and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers killed during a cross-border raid for more than 400 prisoners held in Israel and nearly 60 bodies.</p><p>Almost two decades earlier, in 1985, the Israeli government traded more than 1,100 prisoners — including some convicted of perpetrating or masterminding attacks on Israelis — for three Israeli soldiers captured during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Some of the released prisoners eventually became senior militant leaders.</p><p>During the last cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, a one-week truce in November 2023, Israel released roughly three prisoners — women and minors — for each hostage returned to Israel. Ultimately, Hamas freed about 100 hostages — including more than 20 who were not Israeli and were not included in the deal with Israel — in exchange for about 240 prisoners held by Israel.</p><p>The ratio frustrated some critics in Israel, including some relatives of hostages, while other captives’ family members have demanded that Israel pay any price to bring people back. When Israeli soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/15/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news" title="">accidentally killed three hostages</a> in Gaza who had escaped their captors, Itzik Horn, whose adult sons were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, said Israel must immediately reach a deal to free all the captives, even if it means releasing Palestinians held in Israeli jails on terrorism charges.</p><p>“Let them free all the Palestinian prisoners we have here, all the terrorists — what do I care?” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/16/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news?smid=url-share#israel-hostage-killings-families-hamas" title="">Mr. Horn said more than a year ago</a>. “The most important thing isn’t to defeat Hamas. The only victory here is to bring back all the hostages.” Mr. Horn’s sons are still being held captive.</p><p>The families of hostages are split over this and other issues; a small minority have opposed a deal. The Tikva Forum, an Israeli group representing some captives’ families, opposed the latest cease-fire agreement. In a statement on Wednesday, when news of the deal emerged, the group said <a href="https://x.com/tikvaforumENG/status/1879615196748202032" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> on social media that it objected to an agreement with Hamas, which it called “a terror organization that should be destroyed.”</p><p>“This deal leaves dozens of hostages behind in Gaza,” the group said. “It also sets the stage for the next massacre and future kidnappings of Israelis.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I4OTlkMTAwLTBhY2EtNWRiZi1iZTVkLWUzNzM1YzQyNGI5MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#hamas-in-charge-gaza" data-source-id="100000009935913"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon"><img alt="Adam Rasgon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/14/reader-center/author-adam-rasgon/author-adam-rasgon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T17:01:19.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 12:01 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Hamas’s military wing, in Deir al Balah, central Gaza, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As the cease-fire in Gaza was coming into effect on Sunday, masked gunmen, crowded into white pickup trucks, paraded through the streets of Gaza while supporters chanted the name of Hamas’s military wing. By sending its fighters out in an unmistakable show of force, Hamas was trying to deliver an unequivocal message to Palestinians in Gaza, to Israel and to the international community: that despite heavy losses during the war among Hamas’s fighters, police officers, political leaders and government administrators, it remains the dominant Palestinian power in Gaza.</p><p>“The message is that Hamas is ‘the day after’ for the war,” said Ibrahim Madhoun, an analyst close to Hamas based in Turkey, using a phrase that refers to the future administration of Gaza.</p><div><p>“They’re conveying that Hamas must be a part of any future arrangements, or at least, be coordinated with,” he added.</p><p>On Sunday, the Hamas-run government media office announced that thousands of police officers were beginning to deploy throughout the territory to “preserve security and order.” Government ministries and institutions, the media office said, were prepared to start working “according to the government plan to implement all the measures that guarantee bringing back normal life.”</p><p>At the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern city of Khan Younis, at least three uniformed police officers were standing as the Palestinian national anthem played in the background, according to a video posted on social media and verified by The New York Times.</p><p>Later on Sunday, dozens of uniformed, gun-toting Hamas militants were seen in Saraya Square in Gaza City next to a car holding Israeli hostages before they were handed over to the Red Cross. The militants were attempting to push away crowds of people pressing toward the car.</p><p>Even as Hamas attempts to project that it still controls Gaza and plans to play a key role in its administration, its future there remains uncertain. Israeli officials have said they have not given up on their stated war goal of dismantling Hamas’s military wing and government, strongly suggesting that they could resume the war against the militant group after the freeing of some hostages.</p><p>Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, said on Sunday that Hamas’s rule was dangerous for Israel’s security and emphasized that Israel had not agreed to a permanent cease-fire that leaves Hamas in power.</p><p>“We are determined to achieve the objectives of the war,” he said.</p><p>While some analysts say Israel could eventually remove Hamas from power, others say it would struggle to resume the war in the face of international pressure. And even if it does, those analysts say, Israeli forces will face immense challenges in uprooting Hamas from Gaza without carrying out a direct occupation.</p><p>Ali Jarbawi, a political science professor at Birzeit University, said Hamas’s parades through Gaza on Sunday were more than a message to the international community that it was in control. They also reflect the reality on the ground, he said.</p><p>“Hamas was there before the war and they’re there now,” he said.</p><p>Aritz Parra<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzExYjhlYzIwLTYxOGMtNWEwYi1iYTY4LTQyZWViY2Q2ZGRmZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#israel-hamas-cease-fire-next-steps" data-source-id="100000009934896"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman"><img alt="Aaron Boxerman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T15:56:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 10:56 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Palestinians walking past rubble in northern Gaza on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel and Hamas reached an agreement on an initial six-week truce in part by putting off their most intractable disputes to a nebulous second phase — which neither side is sure they will reach.</p><p>Under the agreement, 16 days into the initial cease-fire, Israeli and Hamas officials are expected to begin negotiating next steps: an end to the war, the release of the remaining living hostages from Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.</p><div><p>Israeli leaders have long insisted that they will not end the war until Hamas is destroyed. That appeared far from reality on Sunday as Hamas militants, some waving rifles, fanned out in parts of Gaza in pickup trucks, in a show of authority to Palestinians and Israelis alike.</p><p>Israel and Hamas have both preserved some of their bargaining chips. At the end of the 42-day truce, Hamas will still have around two-thirds of the 98 remaining hostages, including dozens who are believed to be dead. And Israel will still occupy parts of Gaza, and hold major prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure.</p><p>But as part of the talks, the Israeli government will then probably have to decide whether it is willing to choose one of its war aims, bringing home the hostages, over another, destroying Hamas. And choosing the hostages might threaten Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s grip on power in Israel.</p><p>In the meantime, both sides have agreed to postpone a decisive agreement as to the war’s end and the future of Gaza, and hope the 42-day cease-fire will play to their advantage, said Shlomo Brom, a retired Israeli brigadier general. Hamas, in particular, “hopes that the new dynamic will prevent Israel from returning to fighting,” he said.</p><p>The decision to accept a temporary cease-fire opened deep fissures within Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, which is stacked with hard-liners. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, resigned in protest from the cabinet and withdrew his Jewish Power party from the coalition on Sunday.</p><p>The Religious Zionism party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, threatened to bolt the coalition, too, if Mr. Netanyahu failed to renew the fighting after the end of the 42-day truce. If Mr. Smotrich’s party also left, Mr. Netanyahu’s government would hold fewer than half of the seats in the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, which could cause the government to fall and force new elections.</p><p>On Saturday night, Mr. Netanyahu stressed that the cease-fire was temporary for now. He argued that Israel retained the right to return to the war if “the second stage negotiations are ineffectual,” adding that President-elect Donald J. Trump would support Israel’s decision.</p><p>“We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the United States,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised address.</p><p>The truce’s fragility was underscored on Sunday morning when Hamas did not immediately hand over a list of hostages to be released to Israel, prompting a nearly three-hour delay in the cease-fire. Analysts say the deal will probably see numerous similar tests over the next few weeks as both sides flex their muscles.</p><p>The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have called on the Israeli government to bring home the remaining captives by fulfilling all the phases of the deal. Noa Argamani, a freed hostage whose boyfriend, Avinatan Or, remains in captivity, said that it broke her heart that he was not going to be freed in this round.</p><p>“The progress in the past few days is a very important step, but the deal must go through in full, completely, in all of its stages,” Ms. Argamani said in a speech in Miami on Thursday.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M1NzAyNWM4LWJiN2EtNTMyYS04ZTM1LWRjY2NhMTk5MjVmYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire#hostages-emily-tamari-doron-steinbrecher-romi-gonen" data-source-id="100000009935840"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-19T11:29:13.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 19, 2025, 6:29 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Undated handout photographs from the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters of the freed hostages Romi Gonen, left, Emily Damari, center, and Doron Steinbrecher.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Hostages Families Forum</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Three hostages have been freed in the first phase of the cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel.</p><p>The hostages, all women, were released into Red Cross custody in Gaza on Sunday and were transferred to Israeli forces, who took them to meet their mothers, the Israeli military said.</p><div><p>About 100 hostages, living and dead, are thought still to be held in Gaza, most of them taken in the deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
