The pope, in his customary white robes, and Mr. Joko, who was wearing a traditional Islamic hat, stood on the footsteps of the country’s Dutch colonial-era presidential palace as Indonesian honor guards paraded and a marching band played hymns.</p><p>Indonesia is the first stop on Francis’s 11-day tour of Asia-Pacific, a grueling physical test for the 87-year-old pope who has made reaching out to Asia a priority of his pontificate. Francis, the first pope to visit the Arabian Peninsula, has also pushed interfaith harmony as one of his key missions. He plans to do so again in Indonesia, which has the world’s biggest population of Muslims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In a speech at the presidential palace, Francis compared Indonesia’s religious, ethnic and cultural mix to its biodiversity. Tolerance and mutual respect, he said, helped bring the country together “just as the ocean is the natural element uniting all Indonesian islands.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Pope and Mr. Joko both praised Indonesia’s pluralism, but Francis said the country has to be vigilant in fighting intolerance and extremism.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Adi Weda</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He added that unity was a “wise and delicate balance” that “must be continuously defended” and “in a special way by those in political life” in the face of “imbalances and suffering that still persist in some areas.” While Indonesia is overwhelmingly Muslim, it is also home to millions of people who follow other faiths, including Catholicism. It has been a vibrant example of interreligious harmony, but in recent years those in religious minorities have faced discrimination amid the rise of conservative strains of Islam.</p><p>“For Indonesia, differences are a gift,” Mr. Joko, who is set to step down in October after a decade in office, said in his speech. “And tolerance is a fertilizer for peace and unity of a nation.”</p><p>But some Indonesian Catholics said they are persecuted because of their faith. This, they added, was driven by others’ belief that they wanted convert Muslims.</p><p>“I hope that the pope shows that Catholics are not fanatics,” said Desri Yohanna, 24, as she left<strong> </strong>Sunday Mass at the Santa Clara Catholic Church on the outskirts of Jakarta.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On Wednesday, Francis addressed those fears, saying the Catholic Church wished to “increase interreligious dialogue” and cooperation with other faiths but to “never proselytize.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Indonesia is the first stop on Francis’s 11-day tour of Asia-Pacific, a grueling physical test for the 87-year-old pope.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yasuyoshi Chiba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Joko, who has urged the United States to “do more” to stop the war in Gaza, made reference to the conflict in the Middle East, adding that it “greatly appreciated the Vatican’s attitude to continue to voice a call for peace in Palestine.”</p><p>Francis did not specifically refer to the conflict, but said that intolerance has driven violence around the world, in contrast with Indonesia’s founding principle of unity.</p><p>Muktita Suhartono<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
