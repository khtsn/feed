</span> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581488/team-liquid-brazil-vs-kr-blaze-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-ubqf/?game=all&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">2-0</a> and continued its path up the upper bracket. Just like the other upper bracket match between <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/587918/alkyia-leads-karmine-corp-gc-to-sweep-over-xipto-esports-gc" target="_blank">Karmine Corp GC and Xipto Esports GC</a>, the series was one-sided as TL Brazil started its GC Champs run as best as the team could have.</p>

<p>The series began on Corrode, which KRÜ chose first. While both teams ran double-Controller with Viper and Omen, TL opted for double-Initiator as well, running no Sentinel agents. KRÜ decided to pick up the Sage, and despite starting on the defense side, the extra utility from TL proved useful for its pistol round win. KRÜ BLAZE prevented the bonus round conversion, but <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/11232/daiki">
		daiki	</a>
</span> was on fire to start the series. On KAY/O, their utility and fragging were both excellent as TL Brazil reached an 8-4 lead at the half.</p>

<p>KRÜ won the second pistol off of an ace from <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/25663/dods">
		dods	</a>
</span>, who fought through multiple clutch moments to earn a momentous round win. </p>


<p><em>dods earns a pistol ace clutch against TL Brazil.</em></p>

<p>Yet, that momentum was abruptly shunted as TL won its eco round and proceeded to end the half perfectly, winning the map 13-5.</p>

<p>That meant Bind would be the first chance for TL Brazil to win the series, and after playing so well on the opponent&#39;s map pick, now the team could run its planned Veto double-Controller composition. KRÜ ran a classic Bind double-Duelist and double-Controller, with a Fade to round it all out. Just like on Corrode, TL won the first pistol and got to an early lead, reaching an 8-1 lead with its only loss on the bonus round. The defense half from TL was highlighted by some great Veto gameplay, negating a lot of the execute potential from the double-Duelist composition from KRÜ. This time, TL entered the half up 9-3, with a bigger lead than the halftime on Corrode.</p>

<p>So, when TL won the second pistol and converted the bonus round to get up to match point, it was only a matter of time. Eventually, TL Brazil won the map 13-6 and swept the series against KRÜ BLAZE to continue fighting in the upper bracket.</p>

<p>The standouts of the series were both daiki and <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/12143/bizerra">
		Bizerra	</a>
</span>, who each had standout performances on a map while performing well in the other. On Corrode, daiki was the star on KAY/O, ending the map with 22 kills, a 1.81 map rating, and 306 ACS. Then, on Bind, Bizerra stepped up with the best Veto performance of the event so far, with 22 kills of their own, a 1.67 map rating, 331 ACS, and 227 ADR.</p>

<p>With this win, Team Liquid Brazil moves on in the upper bracket and will face the victor of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581487/g2-gozen-vs-nova-esports-gc-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-ubqf" target="_blank">the G2 Gozen and Nova Esports GC match</a>. As for KRÜ BLAZE, the team has to fight through the lower bracket and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581495/kr-blaze-vs-giantx-gc-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr1" target="_blank">will face GIANTX GC</a> to start its potential lower bracket run.</p>
