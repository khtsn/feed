He has long thought the American status quo needed a good shaking. And with the victory of Donald J. Trump, he was optimistic that big change was in the offing.</p><p>“It’s amazing,” Mr. Cordeiro, 42, said of Mr. Trump’s victory. “I think it’s a beautiful thing, the people he has with him: Elon, Tulsi, Vivek, or whatever his name is. I think it’s going to be a game changer.”</p><p>As tens of millions of Americans trudged off to start their Wednesday with hearts full of fear, anger and dread, a little more than half of the nation’s voters — over 71 million — were feeling something between cautious optimism and flat-out ebullience over Mr. Trump’s decisive victory and return to the White House.</p><p>In interviews with voters around the country, it was evident how strongly Mr. Trump’s bedrock campaign promises, like improving the economy, fixing the immigration system and avoiding major wars, had resonated. It was also clear how much faith many Americans continued to have in him, despite his extensive history of deceit, his multiple felony indictments and his blatant efforts to overturn his 2020 electoral loss.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Indeed, some supporters were hoping that with a second term for Mr. Trump on the horizon, the United States would finally have a chance to taste a straight-up slug of undiluted Trumpism, given the decisiveness of his victory; the likelihood that he will have fewer skeptical, non-MAGA voices in his cabinet; and the possibility of full Republican control of Congress. (The election results gave Mr. Trump’s Republican Party a majority in the U.S. Senate, though the battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives remained unresolved.)</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The crowd during a watch party in Bozeman, Mont., after Mr. Trump was announced the winner. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Louise Johns for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>These prospects felt liberating to Reagan Faulkner, 20, the president of the College Republicans at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Ms. Faulkner, who said she was a Trump fan from childhood, said she used to refrain from wearing her MAGA hat to class, afraid others would judge her.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, she wore it proudly. “You know in ‘Home Alone’ when the kid walks outside and goes, ‘I’m not afraid anymore’?” Ms. Faulkner said. “I think that’s the overwhelming feeling that conservatives have. And I think the other side has been put in the back corner.”</p><p>How Trumpism 2.0 might manifest as specific policy was not top of mind for supporters like Marcus Fuller, 37, of Orlando, Fla., an unemployed Trump supporter. “I’ll be honest: I don’t care what he does,” Mr. Fuller said. “I just feel more safe with Trump being president.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But others were already imagining a brighter future in greater detail.</p><p>Things are going to get better, said Bill Womack, 60, a utility worker in Cartersville, Ga. “He’s going to start drilling, drilling, drilling. Prices are going to drop — on food, on everything. He’s going to shut the border down again,” he said, adding, “Whatever that man says he’s going to do, you can bet he’s going to get it done.”</p><p>For some Trump supporters — those who believed his dark and unfounded conspiracies about the 2020 election and the idea that Democrats had somehow cheated to win — the victory in 2024 demonstrated that their vigilance over America’s voting systems had been effective.</p><p>This was the position of Amy Kremer, a committeewoman for the Republican National Committee from Georgia who helped organize the Jan. 6, 2021, rally that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.</p><p>“2020 was stolen … I have not forgotten,” Ms. Kremer posted early Wednesday morning on X. In a later post, she <a href="https://x.com/AmyKremer/status/1854167100333367784" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a>, “We stopped the steal!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some Trump supporters, including Amy Kremer, who organized the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the attack on the Capitol, sees Mr. Trump’s victory as validating efforts to watch over America’s election systems. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Amy/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Others saw the hand of divine intervention in the win, or embraced the idea that it was Mr. Trump who was, despite his documented penchant for falsehoods, an avatar of truth whose story had been distorted by mainstream news outlets.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That belief appears to have softened memories of Mr. Trump’s most notorious acts, including his incitement of the Jan. 6 mob.</p><p>In Middletown, Ohio, Chris Combs, 41, the owner of a barbecue restaurant, said he was not worried that Mr. Trump would be a threat to democracy in his second term. “Ninety percent of what is written about him is bad press,” Mr. Combs said. “A lot of media take his words out of context.”</p><p>Chuck Seger, 54, a carpenter from Brooks, Maine, still believes the 2020 election was stolen from Mr. Trump. But more compelling than the past was a future in which Mr. Seger hoped to see fewer immigrants and lower taxes.</p><p>“He said a few things that were pretty ridiculous, but I’m OK with it,” Mr. Seger said of Mr. Trump. “The world needs to be woken up.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Faulkner, the North Carolina college student, was allowing herself to dream about a better economy on Wednesday. She said she was hopeful a second Trump administration would create conditions that allow her to buy a house, get married and have children.</p><p>Mr. Cordeiro, the owner of the cannabis company, was also feeling bullish about the next four years. He was an opponent of a measure on Tuesday’s ballot in Florida that would have legalized marijuana in the state. He sells varieties of hemp because of a legal loophole in the federal farm bill, and he believes that if the ballot measure had passed, it would have put the weed industry in the hands of big business, with new regulations that would shut out a small-scale entrepreneur like himself.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Mr. Cordeiro was excitedly talking about expanding his company, Natural Dragonfly Wellness, which currently does business at festivals and online. He was thinking about building a new cannabis-themed lounge in Jacksonville.</p><p>He also acknowledged that Mr. Trump had a bumpy four years in his first term. But now, Mr. Cordeiro was expecting things to go more smoothly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s win made Mike Cordeiro, a Florida business owner, optimistic that big change was on the horizon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“All those four years, as smart as Trump is, he learned so much that he’s not going to make the same mistakes,” he said.</p><p>For the many conservative Christians who supported Mr. Trump, and appreciated his role in rolling back abortion access, his victory generated a wave of joy. On Wednesday’s edition of “Fox &amp; Friends,” the popular conservative morning show on Fox News, co-host Ainsley Earhardt made note of a viral video that showed a large group of Trump supporters <a href="https://x.com/MissPearls/status/1854124793953661155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">singing the old church hymn</a> “How Great Thou Art” outside of his victory party.</p><p>“For so many Christians, so many evangelicals, Catholics, the abortion issue was a big deal, and they showed up and they were praying,” she said. “Everyone that I spoke with, they were on their knees. They were scared about the direction of this country.”</p><p>Ronnie Graham, 73, a business broker in Raleigh, N.C., stayed up deep into Tuesday night watching results, waiting for something to go awry the way it seemed to in 2020. Just days earlier, he had stood at his church and told the congregation about how he believed this was the most important election in the country’s history. On Wednesday, he felt relief and joy.</p><p>“It was just jubilation — we could barely sleep,” Mr. Graham said in a phone interview. “I believe that God has saved him and saved his life, spared his life so he can help bring back our republic,” Mr. Graham added.</p><p>Mark Pergerson, 59, a friend of Mr. Graham’s who runs a small heating and air conditioning business outside Raleigh, said he celebrated by treating an entire restaurant to breakfast — about $200 — “courtesy of the red, white and blue and our president Donald Trump.”</p><p>Eric Adelson<!-- -->, <!-- -->Johnny Kauffman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Kevin Williams<!-- --> and <!-- -->Murray Carpenter<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Richard Fausset, based in Atlanta, writes about the American South, focusing on politics, culture, race, poverty and criminal justice.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/richard-fausset">More about Richard Fausset</a></span></p></div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane">More about Emily Cochrane</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.
