Trump held two rallies this afternoon in Pennsylvania before a late-night event in Michigan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/harris-trump-pennsylvania-campaign.html" title="">Harris is spending her entire day in Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p>It is no accident that both campaigns are focusing their final push on Pennsylvania. The state has long been seen as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/pennsylvania-trump-harris.html" title="">most important battleground</a>, in large part because it carries more electoral votes than the rest. Harris and Trump have directed more money there than anywhere else, flooding the airwaves with ads — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/harris-trump-closing-messages-ads.html" title="">Harris focusing on the economy, Trump on fear</a>.</p><p>In several states a majority of voters have already cast their ballots, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/early-vote-tracker-2024.html" title="">and you can see the breakdown here</a>. But that’s not the case in Pennsylvania, where most of the votes will be cast tomorrow. The state’s remaining voters could prove to be decisive: Trump has broad support among people who are less likely to vote, making <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/upshot/election-turnout-trump-harris-polls.html" title="">turnout especially important for him and other Republicans</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>In other battlegrounds:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Trump is leaning on an unusual <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/us/elections/elon-musk-super-pac.html" title="">canvassing effort funded by Elon Musk</a>.</p></li><li><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/wisconsin-waukesha-county-trump-harris.html" title="">crumbling Republican stronghold in Wisconsin</a> could determine who wins the state.</p></li><li><p>Georgia’s relatively new status as a swing state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/us/georgia-swing-state-election-stress.html" title="">has been overwhelming</a> for residents.</p></li><li><p>Republicans believe Democrats are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/us/democrats-north-carolina-electoral-vote.html" title="">too optimistic in North Carolina</a>.</p></li><li><p>Saginaw County, in Michigan, recognizes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/saginaw-michigan-election.html" title="">its crucial role in the election</a>.</p></li><li><p>Fights over places like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/schweikert-shah-arizona-election-congress.html" title="">suburban Arizona</a> are set to be important.</p></li><li><p>We took a look at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/crime-swing-states-election.html" title="">crime rates in swing states</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">FiveThirtyEight and The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-35bb9d66">Presidential races are rarely, if ever, this close</h2><p>Polls show the race to be essentially tied, both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">nationwide</a> and across <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" title="">the battleground states</a>.
