Never in the history of modern polling has a race been so close up to Election Day.</p><p>However, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/upshot/polls-trump-harris-election.html" title="">Nate Cohn, our chief political analyst, wrote</a>, polls tend to err one way or another, even if slightly. Either candidate could win in a manner that feels fairly decisive, for example by securing more than 300 electoral votes.</p><p>With so much uncertain, Americans are entering Election Day on edge. Harris and Trump have framed it as an existential battle, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/election-anxiety.html" title="">in dozens of interviews over the final weekend of the campaign</a>, voters expressed concerns about post-election violence.</p><p>The Times reviewed messages from right-wing groups on Telegram across a dozen states. Their posts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/technology/telegram-right-wing-groups-election.html" title="">overwhelmingly spewed disinformation and violent imagery</a>, a harbinger of potential chaos.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, left, and the country’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Cohen/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-6b924cc0">Leaked documents caused an uproar in Israel</h2><p>The Israeli authorities are investigating a spokesman for the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is suspected of illegally obtaining and leaking classified documents to the news media. The documents helped support Netanyahu’s reasoning for adding tough new conditions for a cease-fire deal with Hamas over the summer.</p><p>The case has caused an uproar in Israel, where critics have accused Netanyahu of blocking a deal to return hostages and of prolonging the war in Gaza for political reasons. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-leaked-documents-hamas-gaza.html" title="">Here’s what else to know</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>King Felipe during a visit to Paiporta, in the region of Valencia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manaure Quintero/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-eb836f2">Anger in Spain over flooding catastrophe</h2><p>Parts of Spain were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/europe/spain-floods-valencia-rain.html" title="">deluged with more heavy rains today</a>, as the country continued to grapple with the aftermath of last week’s catastrophic floods that killed at least 215 people.</p><p>The disaster has sparked an angry debate in Spain over accountability, with some people accusing government officials of acting too slowly in the face of a crisis.
