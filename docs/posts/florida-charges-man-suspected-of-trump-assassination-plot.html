Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course in September, defying federal prosecutors who had asked the state to suspend its investigation while their own moved forward.</p><p>The state charged Ryan W. Routh with attempted felony murder, citing injuries that a child sustained in a crash on Interstate 95 shortly after police officers shut down the highway in pursuit of Mr. Routh. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/trump-golf-ryan-routh-gunman-plea.html" title="">has pleaded not guilty</a> to federal charges, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/trump-assassination-attempt-routh-hearing.html" title="">attempted assassination of a presidential candidate</a>.</p><p>Ashley Moody, the Florida attorney general, and Gov. Ron DeSantis, both Republicans, have repeatedly criticized the Biden Justice Department over its investigation of Mr. Routh, questioning federal prosecutors’ credibility because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/us/politics/jack-smith-trump-election-documents-charges.html" title="">until recently</a>, they were also prosecuting Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. DeSantis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/us/politics/trump-assassination-attempt-investigation.html" title="">began the state’s parallel investigation</a> two days after the shooting, saying the federal agencies could not be trusted. In October, Ms. Moody sued the Justice Department, asking a federal judge to stop the department from blocking the state’s investigation after federal authorities said theirs should proceed first.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Moody’s complaint said that among other things, federal officials did not want Florida to interview witnesses while the federal investigation was going on.</p><p>Having dueling federal and state investigations could complicate them both, especially because the federal system does not allow for depositions as the state system does, said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who is now a defense lawyer. When a witness provides statements to multiple investigators, defense lawyers become more likely to find inconsistencies in the testimonies that could allow them to create reasonable doubt.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ms. Moody reiterated that Florida officials are “within our right” to pursue state charges against Mr. Routh.</p><p>“There were many questions surrounding the agency prosecuting the president-elect and at the same time investigating his attempted murder,” Ms. Moody said of the Justice Department at a news conference in Stuart, near where Mr. Routh was stopped after fleeing the Trump International Golf Club on Sept. 15.</p><p>She and Mr. DeSantis acknowledged that once Mr. Trump takes office next month, their perspective on the federal investigation will change.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The tide will turn on January 20th,” Mr. DeSantis <a href="https://x.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1869406324280496133" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on the social media platform X</a>. The governor had been scheduled to announce the arrest warrant in person, but could not because of bad weather in Tallahassee.</p><p>Federal prosecutors say that Mr. Routh appeared to have surveyed Mr. Trump’s golf course for about a month before Sept. 15. That day, he positioned himself outside a fence near the sixth hole. A Secret Service agent on a golf cart scouting the property one hole ahead of Mr. Trump saw the barrel of a semiautomatic rifle and fired.</p><p>Acting on witness testimony, officials identified the car in which the suspect fled and pulled over Mr. Routh heading north along Interstate 95 in neighboring Martin County.</p><p>According to the 18-page arrest warrant, five cars crashed about four miles south of where sheriff’s deputies had detained Mr. Routh. A 6-year-old girl suffered “life-threatening” injuries in the crash, the warrant says.</p><p>Ms. Moody said those injuries and Mr. Routh’s criminal conduct, “which we believe rises to the level of domestic terrorism,” justified the attempted felony murder charge.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Florida Charges Man Accused Of Trying to Assassinate Trump<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
