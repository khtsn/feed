Even parties that would seem to be his natural allies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/world/europe/trump-tariffs-europe-right.html" title="">are nervous</a>. Some have quietly tiptoed back from the American president.</p><p>But Saturday was not the day for disputes. Leaders of far-right parties in Europe came to Madrid for what, on the surface at least, amounted to a boldface names booster rally for a new Trump era.</p><p>There was Marine Le Pen of France’s far-right National Rally; the Netherland’s populist, Geert Wilders; the leader of Italy’s League party, Matteo Salvini. All made clear that they shared Mr. Trump’s charge against what they see as “wokeism,” “gender theory,” and overweening environmentalism.</p><p>For them, the American president had blown through the last barriers that had confined their parties to the political margins. The taboos had been toppled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Trump’s tornado has changed the world in just a couple of weeks,” Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary told his allies from the stage of the summit whose slogan was, “Make Europe Great Again.”</p><p>“Yesterday we were the heretics,” he said. “Now we are the mainstream.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="europe-right-mega" data-id="100000009979018" data-source-id="100000009979018"><div slug="europe-right-mega" data-sourceid="100000009979018" id="embed-id-100000009979018">

But many of these parties are popular among young voters, and stand a chance to enter governments in coming elections. They think Mr. Trump’s victory has put wind in their sails.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s victory “brought a political earthquake to the world,” Mr. Wilders said. “He brings a message of hope.”</p><p>They skewered the “liberal fascists” who they said had replaced Christian civilization with “a sick Satanic utopia,” the “creeps” who “want to turn our children into trans-freaks,” and the supposed ethnic replacement of native-born Europeans by immigrants. They borrowed liberally from conspiracy theories.</p><p>And along with Mr. Trump they shared a distaste for the European Union — even though many of their countries benefit from E.U. funds and nearly all the parties have disavowed cries to leave the bloc since Brexit has proved to be a drag on Britain’s economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Nonetheless it was clear that their idea of making “Europe Great Again” was to tear down the European Union as it now stands. “Less Europe, more freedom,” Mr. Salvini said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Participants applaud onstage at the end of a meeting of Patriots for Europe, the European Parliament’s largest far-right bloc, at a hotel in Madrid on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thomas Coex/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Some of those attending questioned the very slogan of the event. “They say they want to make Europe great but what do I care about defending Europe?” said Jesus Castañón, 79, a retired architect who sat in the crowd. “It does not deserve it.”</p><p>At the gathering, the European Union was uniformly loathed as a group of unelected bureaucrats sealed in glass palaces and intent on infringing upon nations with excessive regulation and sabotaging their economies with climate policies.</p><p>Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, most of Europe’s mainstream parties have come to accept the need to spend more money on defense, and they talk of unity to confront potential trade disputes with Mr. Trump.</p><p>But few at the rally spoke of needing to increase cooperation among E.U. countries. “The European Union is a pump that works in reverse,” Ms. Le Pen said. “It sucks up the sovereignty from our states to institutionalize powerlessness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>When people at the event talked of making Europe great again, most talked about making Europe a beacon for Christianity, elevating individual nations and restoring their pride and identity.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters watch a Patriots for Europe rally at Marriott Auditorium Hotel on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Instead of supporting the European Union, one member of the crowd said he preferred the re-establishment of the Spanish colonial empire encompassing Spain and Latin America.</p><p>“I have little in common with a Belgian or a northern Italian,” said Gonzalo Ruiz, 64, a retired meteorologist. “Reunification with South America is the dream.”</p><p>Some divisions could not be disguised.
