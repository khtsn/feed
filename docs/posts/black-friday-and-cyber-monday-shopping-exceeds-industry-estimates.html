    <h1>Black Friday and Cyber Monday Shopping Exceeds Industry Estimates</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Almost the same number of people shopped online as those who opted to do their shopping at physical stores: About 126 million people visited physical stores over the holiday weekend, the National Retail Federation said, while roughly 124 million did their shopping online. Black Friday had the most traffic, both in stores and online.</p><p>Consumers spent an average of $235 on gifts for the holidays — $8 more than in 2023 — with almost half spent on clothing or accessories, the retail federation said.</p><p>“Even with this year’s shortened shopping period and the multitude of early sales promotions from retailers, this past weekend exceeded expectations in terms of the sheer volume of shoppers,” Matthew Shay, the president and chief executive of the federation, said in a statement. The group had predicted that roughly 183 million people would shop over the weekend.</p><p>In the survey, 38 percent of shoppers said they had taken advantage of sales during the week leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Retail executives have highlighted these cautious spending patterns in recent weeks: An executive at Target described consumers as shifting from “resilient” to “resourceful,” and a leader at Walmart said shoppers “seek value to maximize their budgets.”</p><p>On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Shay said the slight downturn in the number of shoppers over Thanksgiving weekend partly reflected the fact that the holiday fell later in the month. More shoppers jumped on retailers’ early deals before the holiday weekend, he said.</p></div></div>
