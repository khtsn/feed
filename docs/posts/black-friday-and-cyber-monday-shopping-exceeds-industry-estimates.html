In-store sales were also up but more modestly, at 0.7 percent, for an overall increase of 3.4 percent.</p><p>As a whole, consumer spending, the engine of the U.S. economy, has remained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/business/economy/inflation-pce-fed-interest-rates.html" title="">relatively robust</a>. Corporate executives, however, have recently painted a picture of Americans still feeling the squeeze of inflation, hinting at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/business/black-friday-holiday-shopping-inflation-deals.html" title="">diverging fortunes</a> for retailers as shoppers have become pickier about what they buy and where they buy it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Almost the same number of people shopped online as those who opted to do their shopping at physical stores: About 126 million people visited physical stores over the holiday weekend, the National Retail Federation said, while roughly 124 million did their shopping online. Black Friday had the most traffic, both in-store and online.</p><p>Consumers spent an average of $235 on gifts for the holidays — $8 more than in 2023 — with almost half spent on clothing or accessories, the N.R.F. said.</p><p>“Even with this year’s shortened shopping period and the multitude of early sales promotions from retailers, this past weekend exceeded expectations in terms of the sheer volume of shoppers,” Matthew Shay, the president and chief executive of the N.R.F., said in a statement. The group had predicted that roughly 183 million people would shop over the weekend.</p><p>In the N.R.F. survey, 38 percent of shoppers said they had taken advantage of sales during the week leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Retail executives have highlighted these cautious spending patterns in recent weeks: An executive at Target described consumers as shifting from “resilient” to “resourceful,” and a leader at Walmart said shoppers “seek value to maximize their budgets.”</p><p>On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Shay said the slight downturn in the total number of shoppers over Thanksgiving weekend this year partly reflected the fact that the holiday fell later in the month. More shoppers jumped on retailers’ early deals before the holiday weekend, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The N.R.F. projected U.S. holiday sales to grow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/business/holiday-sales-growth.html" title="">as much as 3.5 percent overall this year,</a> slower than in recent years but in line with averages before the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
