Kathy Hochul of New York resurrected congestion pricing last week, delighting transportation and environmental advocates eager for the benefits the plan promises, from less traffic and fresher air to improvements to mass transit.</p><p>But her efforts also renewed the entrenched opposition to the policy — which includes the incoming U.S. president, congressional Republicans and even the Democratic governor of New Jersey — and could hurt her chances of re-election.</p><p>The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that will operate the toll program, approved the plan on Monday in a 12-to-1 vote. It will charge most drivers $9 to enter the busiest part of Manhattan and is expected to start in early January.</p><p>Governor Hochul <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-pause-hochul.html" title="">sidelined congestion pricing</a> in June because she said she feared its economic impact on New Yorkers. But the policy also threatened to harm the political fortunes of her fellow Democrats during congressional elections earlier this month. About two-thirds of New York State residents who responded to <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SNY-April-2024-Poll-Release-FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Siena College survey in April</a> said they opposed the program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now, the re-emergence of congestion pricing, with the toll lowered from $15 to $9, has predictably angered Republicans, who are already eying the governor’s race in 2026. Among the loudest voices is Representative Mike Lawler, who represents a district in the New York suburbs and is rumored to be considering a run for governor. He released an ad in recent days targeting the toll plan and Governor Hochul.</p><p>And while many Democrats in New York City have cheered the return of congestion pricing, which would be the first program of its kind in the nation, some suburban Democrats have shown frustration.</p><p>Ms. Hochul’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">revised plan</a> is expected to generate $15 billion to pay for essential repairs and upgrades to the city’s mass transit system. It aims to get cars off the crowded streets of Manhattan while improving traffic and air quality.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="nyc-congestion-pricing-map-2rxvk" data-id="100000009825779" data-source-id="100000009825779"><div slug="nyc-congestion-pricing-map-2rxvk" data-sourceid="100000009825779" id="embed-id-100000009825779">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Groups that include city teachers and truckers as well as officials from the State of New Jersey have complained that the plan is unfair to people who have no choice but to drive into the tolling zone. They also have said the tolls will shift traffic and pollution to other parts of the city and region, including to some disadvantaged communities.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This plan is a mistake,” said Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers. “Increased pollution and traffic congestion are still being dumped on the city’s poor, working- and middle-class neighborhoods, and these communities are still being stuck with the bill.”</p><p>But the Transport Workers Union, which initially opposed congestion pricing, supports the revised plan, which includes additional bus service. “The reduced tolling makes it a better deal for working people,” said John Samuelsen, the international president of the TWU. “They have to address the service, though, and she appears to be doing that.”</p><p>The Federal Highway Administration, an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation, and city and state transportation departments must now sign off. The M.T.A. must also complete about 20 days that remain of a 60-day public education campaign that it had started in late April.</p><p>“It’s been a bumpy road, but it’s getting smoother now,” said Lisa Daglian, the executive director of the authority’s Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a watchdog group that supports the plan. “We need congestion pricing.”</p><p>Within days of the news that the toll would be reinstated, Mr. Lawler released a slickly produced ad that showed him railing against Ms. Hochul’s plan from the driver’s seat of his car.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I’ve been fighting congestion pricing for years, because it’s nothing more than a scam — a cash grab,” he says in the ad. “And we’re never going to let Kathy Hochul and the M.T.A. bring it back.”</p><p>After Monday’s vote, Edward F. Cox, chairman of the New York State Republican Party, said, “Kathy Hochul’s blatant flip-flop on congestion pricing immediately after the election is politics at its most cynical.”</p><p>In response to such criticisms, Sam Spokony, a spokesman for Ms. Hochul, emphasized that the vast majority of commuters to Midtown and Lower Manhattan rely on public transit. Transit officials have said 90 percent of commuters who enter the zone on a typical weekday use mass transit.</p><p>The tolling plan, Mr. Spokony said, “will deliver $15 billion to ensure better, faster transit for millions of working New Yorkers.”</p><p>“The critics of our more affordable plan have still failed to offer any of their own meaningful solutions for reducing gridlock, improving emergency vehicle response times and strengthening the transit system that is so vital to New York’s economic future,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>During a news conference last week announcing the return of congestion pricing, Ms. Hochul had said, “I always make decisions based on what’s best for New Yorkers, not my political career.”</p><p>“I’m willing to run into difficult challenges and take on the toughest issues because that’s my job as governor right now,” she said. “And, I’ll put that record out to voters, but not at this time.”</p><p>Among Democrats, the return of congestion pricing laid bare the divisions between the city and the suburbs. Jabari Brisport, a state senator who represents Brooklyn, posted a photo on Friday of a 16-minute wait for an A train with the caption “congestion pricing can’t come soon enough.”</p><p>But Representative Pat Ryan, a Hudson Valley Democrat whose district sits alongside Mr. Lawler’s, was less enthusiastic.</p><p>“For residents of NYC, especially Manhattan, this plan might make sense,” Mr. Ryan wrote on the platform X last week. But he said that creating a financial barrier to driving into the city was only fair if people had access to reliable transit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Costs are still too high, there’s still no real plan to improve service in the Hudson Valley,” he wrote.</p><p>Douglas Muzzio, a longtime political analyst, said that Ms. Hochul’s sudden pause of congestion pricing and now her “11th-hour conversion” to restore it could have consequences for her political future.</p><p>“She’s generally perceived to be a relatively weak governor, and this is an example of that — the pausing of it, the restart of it, she didn’t think it through and was indecisive,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Muzzio said that congestion pricing remains a hot political issue among those who would have to pay the tolls, including people living in parts of Queens and the Bronx as well as in the Long Island suburbs. Just reducing the tolls, he added, would not mollify these critics. “It’s still a fee,” he said. “And fees are anathema to most people.”</p><p>Still, congestion pricing has moved forward at lightning speed in the past five days since Gov. Hochul’s revived it. A broad coalition of transportation, environmental, business and civic groups has increased pressure on the governor in recent months by holding rallies, flooding her office with calls and lobbying Ms. Hochul and her staff in private.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Though many advocates say they still want to see the original $15 toll, they have come around to supporting the lower tolls for now to get congestion pricing up and running before the inauguration of Donald Trump, who has said he would seek to strike down the policy in his first days in office.</p><p>Nine lawsuits have been filed in federal courts in New York and New Jersey challenging congestion pricing. Some plaintiffs in those cases have vowed to keep fighting and are considering seeking an injunction to block the plan from moving ahead.</p><p>Vito J. Fossella, the Staten Island Borough president, who is a plaintiff in one case, said after the M.T.A. vote on Monday that “we’re not giving up by any stretch.” </p><p>“We haven’t changed our opinion since Day 1,” he said. “Congestion pricing will hurt the people of Staten Island by bringing more traffic, more air pollution, and more tolls.”</p><p>The strongest legal challenge is widely considered to be a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/nyregion/nj-congestion-pricing-federal-court.html" title="">case brought by New Jersey officials</a>, including Governor Philip D. Murphy, which was argued before a federal judge in Newark in April and is awaiting a decision. “This post-election rush reeks of politics,” said Randy Mastro, a lawyer who represents the State of New Jersey, on Monday.</p><p>“This is an unprecedented congestion pricing scheme that will have huge consequences for the entire region,” he added. “So time to put on the brakes, not try to steamroll ahead.”</p><p>Nicholas Fandos<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/winnie-hu">More about Winnie Hu</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Grace Ashford covers New York government and politics for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/grace-ashford">More about Grace Ashford</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>20</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Opponents Renew Attacks as Congestion Pricing Program Is Approved<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/ny-metropolitan-transportation-authority">N.Y.
