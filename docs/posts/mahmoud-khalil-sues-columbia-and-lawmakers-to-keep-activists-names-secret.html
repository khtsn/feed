    <h1>Mahmoud Khalil Sues Columbia and Lawmakers to Keep Activists’ Names Secret</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate detained by the Trump administration last weekend, and seven students asked a federal court on Thursday to block the school from producing student disciplinary records to a House committee that demanded them last month.</p><p>The committee’s request and the school’s compliance with it would violate the First Amendment rights of Mr. Khalil and the students and the university’s obligation to protect student privacy, the lawsuit said.</p><p>The seven students, who currently attend Columbia and Barnard College, according to the suit, also asked the court to allow them to proceed anonymously and are referred to in the lawsuit with pseudonyms like Sally Roe and Ned Noe.</p><p>Last month, the House Committee on Education and Workforce sent a letter to Dr. Katrina Armstrong, Columbia’s interim president, and the university board chairs, David Greenwald and Claire Shipman, that said “numerous antisemitic incidents” had taken place.</p></div></div>
