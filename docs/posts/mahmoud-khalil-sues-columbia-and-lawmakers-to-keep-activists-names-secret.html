He earned a master’s degree from Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs in December.</p><p>He has not been charged with any crime. But the Trump administration has accused Mr. Khalil of siding with terrorists and justified his detention by citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/trump-rubio-khalil-columbia-student-protests.html" title="">a little-used statute</a> that allows the secretary of state to deport anyone whose presence is adversarial to foreign policy and national security interests.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, talking to reporters during a stop in Ireland on Wednesday, accused Mr. Khalil of participating in antisemitic activities, including protests that Mr. Rubio said expressed support for Hamas.</p><p>“This is not about free speech,” Mr. Rubio said. “This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The White House has said that Mr. Khalil is only the first of many whom it plans to detain and deport.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan. It names Columbia and Dr. Armstrong; Barnard College and its president, Laura Ann Rosenbury; and the House Committee and its chairman, Representative Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.</p><p>A Columbia spokeswoman declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. A Barnard representative did not immediately comment.</p><p>Mr. Walberg said in a statement that the lawsuit changed nothing. “Our committee will continue its work to protect Jewish students and hold schools accountable for their failures to address rampant antisemitism on our college campuses,” the statement said.</p><p>The lawsuit says that to fully comply with the committee’s request, Columbia would have to turn over private files of hundreds of its students, faculty and staff members. Such information could be used to harass and make threats against the individuals, “whose personal privacy and safety would be jeopardized by the committee’s politically charged investigation,” the suit adds.</p><p>The lawsuit says hearings by the committee on campus antisemitism, which led to the resignations of university presidents, and the requests for student information “were a naked attempt to attack and harass individuals who expressed viewpoints critical of Israel.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-weiser">More about Benjamin Weiser</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>22</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Detainee Sues Columbia To Shield Activists’ Names<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
