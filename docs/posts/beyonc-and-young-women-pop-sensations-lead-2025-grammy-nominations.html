Both are juggernauts in the culture and at the Grammys. With 32 career trophies, Beyoncé, 43, has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/arts/music/beyonce-grammys-win-record.html" title="">won more awards than any other artist</a>, and is now also the most-nominated person, with 99.

She has a total of 14 career wins, and since the 2021 awards has logged 24 nominations for her huge volume of output — four studio albums, four rerecorded LPs and a mountain of bonus tracks — since the pandemic began.</p><p>For album of the year, “Cowboy Carter” and Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” — which she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/04/arts/music/taylor-swift-new-album-grammys.html" title="">announced from the stage</a> at the last Grammy ceremony, in February — will compete against Carpenter’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/arts/music/sabrina-carpenter-short-n-sweet-review.html" title="">Short n’ Sweet</a>,” Charli XCX’s “Brat,” Eilish’s “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” Roan’s “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” and two niche entries: “Djesse Vol. 4,” by the multi-instrumentalist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/style/the-colorful-mozart-of-gen-z.html" title="">Jacob Collier</a>, and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/arts/music/andre-3000-solo-album-new-blue-sun.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">New Blue Sun</a>,” the new-age flute album by André 3000 of the beloved hip-hop group Outkast.</p><p>Despite their many nominations over the years, this is only the second time that Beyoncé and Swift have competed directly in the top album category. In 2010, Swift <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/01/arts/music/01grammy.html" title="">took that award</a> for the first time with “Fearless,” beating Beyoncé’s “I Am … Sasha Fierce.”</p><p>The record of the year category this year, for a single recording, pits Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ’Em” and Swift’s “Fortnight” (which features Post Malone) against some of the year’s ubiquitous singles: Carpenter’s “Espresso,” Charli XCX’s “360,” Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!,” Lamar’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-drake-explainer.html" title="">diss track</a> “Not Like Us” and Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather.” The category also includes “Now and Then,” the Beatles’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/arts/music/beatles-now-and-then-last-song.html" title="">“last” song</a>, assembled from a rough demo recording left by John Lennon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chappell Roan has six nominations, and will compete for best new artist.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chona Kasinger for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Song of the year, a songwriters’ award, has nods for “Fortnight,” “Texas Hold ’Em,” “Birds of a Feather,” “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Not Like Us,” along with “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” a chart-dominating country hit by Shaboozey, who appeared on “Cowboy Carter”; Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’s “Die With a Smile”; and another Carpenter hit, “Please Please Please.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For best new artist, Carpenter, Roan and Shaboozey will face off against the British songwriter and performer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/arts/music/raye-my-21st-century-blues.html" title="">Raye</a>, the Florida-born rapper Doechii, the mellow-groove Texas trio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/magazine/khruangbin-mood-music.html" title="">Khruangbin</a>, the singer-songwriter Teddy Swims and Benson Boone, a rock singer who had a No. 2 hit this year with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_RSwwpPaA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beautiful Things</a>.”</p><p>Beyoncé has a wide field of genre nominations this year, covering pop, rap, country and Americana for various tracks on “Cowboy Carter.”</p><p>Her LP was largely ignored by the Nashville establishment, garnering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/arts/music/beyonce-cowboy-carter-country-radio.html" title="">minimal airplay</a> on country radio stations and being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/arts/music/beyonce-cmas-nominations-cowboy-carter.html" title="">shut out of the Country Music Association Awards</a>. But it is up for best country album at the Grammys, in a contest that may test the regional factionalism of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards.</p><p>She will compete against Post Malone (“F-1 Trillion”), Chris Stapleton (“Higher”), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/arts/music/lainey-wilson-whirlwind.html" title="">Lainey Wilson</a> (“Whirlwind”) and a previous album of the year winner, Kacey Musgraves (“Deeper Well”). Zach Bryan, an admired songwriter with one foot in Nashville, reportedly <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/zach-bryan-grammys-ballot-absent-1236168511/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declined</a> to submit his hit album “The Great American Bar Scene” for the awards. (At the most recent ceremony, “I Remember Everything,” his duet with Musgraves, won best country duo/group performance.)</p><p>For years — decades, even — the Grammys have come under fire for failing to recognize Black performers in the top categories, and for being out of touch with the winds of pop culture, leading to stars like Drake, the Weeknd and Frank Ocean saying they would boycott the awards.</p><p>In an attempt to remedy that, the Recording Academy has streamlined its nominations process and solicited thousands of new members. The academy recently announced that 66 percent of its 13,000 current voting members have joined since 2019 — among them 3,000 women — and that 38 percent of its overall electorate are now people of color.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In an interview, Harvey Mason Jr., the academy’s chief executive, said those changes are key to the Grammys achieving “the right outcomes.”</p><p>“Without our members, we have nothing because the members and the voters are what make up our nominations,” Mason said. “They’re what make up our elected leadership. So without the right membership, everything else breaks down.”</p><p>The nominees for songwriter of the year, non-classical, a recently added category intended to recognize <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/arts/music/grammy-awards-new-categories.html" title="">non-performing songwriters</a>, include Raye; the country writers Jessi Alexander and Jessie Jo Dillon; the in-demand Latin creator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/arts/music/edgar-barrera-latin-grammys.html" title="">Edgar Barrera</a>; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/arts/music/amy-allen-sabrina-carpenter.html" title="">Amy Allen</a>, who has penned hits for Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo and others.</p><p>For producer of the year, non-classical, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/arts/music/daniel-nigro-chappell-roan-olivia-rodrigo.html" title="">Daniel Nigro</a>, who works with Roan and Rodrigo, is up against Alissia (Jamila Woods, Rae Khalil); Ian Fitchuk (Beyoncé, Musgraves); Mustard (Lamar); and Dernst Emile II, known as D’Mile (Lady Gaga and Mars).</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Billie Eilish has seven nominations, and is up for the night’s biggest awards: record, album and song of the year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Julia Spicer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>For best pop vocal album, Carpenter, Eilish, Swift and Roan will face Ariana Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine.” Green Day, Pearl Jam, the Rolling Stones, Idles, Jack White, the Black Crowes and Fontaines D.C. will compete for best rock album.
