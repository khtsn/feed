    <h1>At Capacity</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Everyone I know seems to be talking about their memory lately, how it isn’t what it used to be. Mine isn’t, and there’s some comfort in commiseration. Yes, we’re getting older, isn’t it something to observe, how we can no longer so easily recall names or events or what it was we were just about to say.</p><p>My memory used to be so good I’d have to hide it so it didn’t weird people out. I’d pretend not to remember someone’s full name and their kids’ names and how they used to own a coffee shop outside Albany, lest they think I’d freakishly compiled a dossier on them after our brief conversation at a party three years ago. Now, I’m rewatching a TV series I remember liking in 2022 because I can’t remember even the broadest outline of the plot. I constantly jot notes on stuff that used to surface in the normal churn of my brain’s functioning: funny remarks people make, bits of gossip, summaries of conversations. I take minutes on my own life.</p><p>Sure, age probably has a lot to do with it. For a while, I blamed quarantine and stress for dulling my edge (one friend suggested I might be in my “butter knife era”). But lately the metaphor that seems most apt is that of a computer: It feels as if my hard drive is full. I’m reading and watching and listening to so much content — in addition to living life and having actual experiences, never mind daydreams and nightmares and extended reveries — that it seems I’m running out of disk space. I can’t count on things to auto-save anymore. Since I can’t selectively delete stuff the way I would with an actual hard drive, I’m left creating backups in notebooks, mistrusting my own outmoded technology.</p><p>I’m particularly interested in how a full hard drive is affecting my consumption of culture. Cultural omnivores keep lists of the books they’ve read and the movies they’ve watched, adding to their knowledge and fluency with each item checked off. As I went through The Times’s recent list of the 100 best books of the century, I was gratified by how many I’d read but wondered if a book still counted if I couldn’t remember much about it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>What does it mean for a book, a show, an experience to “count,” anyway? Do you need to be able to recall the plot in detail? Should you be able to describe scenes or bits of dialogue, larger themes, cultural relevance? Or is it enough to just remember enjoying a book, or to be able to conjure a feeling it inspired? I was mulling these questions when I came across <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Collins-t.html" title="">this essay by James Collins</a> from 2010. In it, he describes books that he loved about which he remembers nothing: “All I associate with them is an atmosphere and a stray image or two, like memories of trips I took as a child.”</p><p>Collins suspected, as I do, that the books he can’t remember must have had an effect on his brain anyway, that the experience of reading and engaging with the texts must have changed him in some deeper way, leaving “a kind of mental radiation — that continues to affect me even if I can’t detect it.” I want to believe that my immersion in the fascinating characters and rich plot of “Creation Lake” by Rachel Kushner are performing some kind of alchemy in my brain even if — and it seems unthinkable, halfway through the book — I am likely to forget it all.</p><p>Maryanne Wolf, a neuroscientist, confirmed for Collins that inability to recall a book’s details shouldn’t be taken as evidence that we didn’t assimilate it in some way. “We can’t retrieve the specifics, but to adapt a phrase of William James’s, there is a wraith of memory,” she told him. “The information you get from a book is stored in networks. We have an extraordinary capacity for storage, and much more is there than you realize. It is in some way working on you even though you aren’t thinking about it.” More computer parallels!</p><p>After reading Collins’s essay, I did what I always do when someone’s writing resonates with me — I looked him up. I found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/garden/17collins.html" title="">a charming 2008 article</a> about him and his home in Virginia, learned about a book he wrote, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/Kaplan-t.html" title="">the Times review</a> called “a great big sunny lemon chiffon pie of a novel,” and reserved it from the library. This, I realized, 15 minutes and six open tabs into my digression, is why my brain’s coffers are bursting. There’s too much information, and I’m absolutely helpless to resist it. I look forward to reading Collins’s novel, and I look forward to remembering absolutely none of it.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>How to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/well/mind/memory-loss-prevention.html" title="">prevent memory loss</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/opinion/sunday/age-memory.html" title="">Certain aspects of memory actually get better</a> as we age, according to a neuroscientist.</p></li><li><p>Some memory lapses are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/well/mind/brain-function-memory-dementia.html" title="">a normal part of brain function</a>.</p></li><li><p>“People believe that memory should be effortless, but their expectations for how much they should remember are totally out of whack with how much they’re capable of remembering.” A memory researcher on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/04/magazine/charan-ranganath-interview.html" title="">how to make precious moments last</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-1439ed98"><span><strong>THE WEEK IN CULTURE</strong></span></h3><p>Film and TV</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maggie Smith in “Downton Abbey.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nick Briggs/PBS, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><ul><li><p>Maggie Smith died at 89.

If you have no idea who I’m talking about, picture the Taylor Swift of the literary world, complete with midnight release parties, coveted merch and legions of fans poring over carefully meted out biographical information. Like Swift, Rooney has the goods, though the hoopla around her can be exhausting. Enter the “Intermezzo” era, in which two very different brothers grieve their father in opposite directions, with complicated love lives as their common denominator. It’s possible that we’ve reached peak Rooney (and it would be nice if she used quotation marks), but this novel still contains simple, true sentences worth knowing by heart. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/books/review/sally-rooney-intermezzo.html" title="">Read our review here.</a></p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>Looking for a comprehensive collection of “Intermezzo” reviews? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/books/review/intermezzo-sally-rooney-review-roundup.html" title="">Start here</a>.</p></li><li><p>Sally Rooney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/magazine/sally-rooney-interview.html" title="">explains why</a> she has no plans for another one of her books to be adapted for a screen of any size.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-490546c"><span><strong>T MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philippe Braquenier</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Click the cover image above to read this weekend’s issue of T, The Times’s style magazine.</strong></p><h3 id="link-20a8f964"><span><strong>REAL ESTATE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Dougherty in St. Paul, Minn.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p><strong>The Hunt: </strong>A recent retiree hoped to start a new chapter in the Twin Cities, with a budget under $180,000.
