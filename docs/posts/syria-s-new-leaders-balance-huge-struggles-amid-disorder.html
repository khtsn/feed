The effort has been complicated because Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the rebellion, is designated as a terrorist group by the United States and the United Nations. The group, once linked to Al Qaeda, has been accused of human rights violations in the years it has governed a part of northwestern Syria.</p><p>President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, plans to hold meetings about Syria this week in Israel, while Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken plans to visit Turkey and Jordan. Mr. Blinken plans to press his hosts for help in ensuring a transition to an “accountable and representative” Syrian government that respects the rights of minorities, the State Department said.</p><p>The department also said that the new government should “prevent Syria from being used as a base of terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors, and ensure that chemical weapons stockpiles are secured and safely destroyed.”</p><p>The American diplomatic effort comes as Israel, the closest U.S. ally in the region, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/11/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-strikes-syria" title="">launched hundreds of</a><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/11/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-strikes-syria" title=""> </a></strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/11/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-strikes-syria" title="">strikes</a> on military assets in Syria, saying it wants to keep weapons out of the hands of extremists.</p><p>The State Department’s top counterterrorism official, Elizabeth Richard, acknowledged on Wednesday that the Biden administration had been surprised by the sudden collapse of the Assad regime.
