The air force has been a key part of Israel’s effort in Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-strike-hamas.html" title="">carrying out airstrikes</a> that have flattened much of the enclave and left thousands dead.</p><p>The appeal immediately drew a rebuke from the Israeli prime minister’s office, which said that “statements that weaken the Israel Defense Forces and strengthen our enemy during wartime” were “unforgivable.”</p><p>The Israeli military said it had decided to discharge active-duty reservists who signed the letter, though the numbers that could be dismissed were not expected to be high. Most of the people who signed the list were not active duty, the military said. It was not clear if the military had already carried out the dismissals.</p><p>The letter is an unusually large-scale show of criticism from members of the air force about the way the war has been run. But this military branch, in particular, has previously been a notable voice of opposition to the government.</p><p>Air force pilots threatened to stop serving in the military during nationwide protests in 2023 against deeply divisive government efforts to reduce the power of institutions that had acted as a check on his government, including the Supreme Court.</p><p>The campaign was suspended after the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, but last month the government returned to the effort, passing legislation that gave politicians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-judges.html" title="">more control over choosing judges</a>.</p><p>The letter on Thursday claimed that continuing the war would lead to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages.html" title="">deaths of the hostages</a> and argued that it was driven by political rather than security interests.</p><p>“Stop the fighting and return all of the hostages — now!” it said. “Every day that passes endangers their lives.”</p><p>Critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel have accused him of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/world/middleeast/netanyahu-may-be-forced-to-choose-between-a-cease-fire-and-political-survival.html" title="">prioritizing his political survival</a> over the return of the hostages. Mr. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners have threatened to leave the coalition if he ends the war without having defeated Hamas.</p><p>Maj. Gen. Nimrod Sheffer, a former senior air force officer, said he had signed the letter because he felt the hostages in Gaza were becoming increasingly vulnerable. The Israeli government has said it believes 24 of the remaining 59 hostages to be alive.</p><p>“It is immoral to abandon 59 hostages in Gaza,” General Sheffer said in a phone interview. “Someone needs to say loud and clear that they need to come home,” he added. “We can’t stay quiet anymore.”<br/></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Tensions in the Middle East</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> The Death of a Palestinian American Boy:</strong> Amer Rabee, 14, was fatally shot by Israeli forces in the West Bank, according to his family. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/nyregion/nj-amer-rabee-killed-west-bank.html">Community leaders gathered</a> in New Jersey to demand justice.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Strikes in Yemen:</strong> U.S. commanders planning for a possible conflict with China are increasingly concerned that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/china-weapons-yemen-bombing.html">bombing campaign in Yemen</a> is draining arms needed to deter China.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘The Floodgates of Horror’:</strong> The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, sharply criticized Israel’s renewed blockade of aid to Gaza as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/guterres-israel-gaza-blockade.html">a violation of its obligations</a> under international law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints</strong><strong>:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza.html">President Trump is more aligned than his predecessor</a> on Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skepticism About U.S.-Iran Talks</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-iran-reaction.html">Many Israelis were surprised</a> when Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran in an effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html">to rein in the country’s nuclear</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html"> program.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Attempt to Fire Israeli Spy Chief:</strong> Israel’s highest court gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government a deadline to find a compromise over his firing of one of his top intelligence chiefs, part of a courtroom battle that could lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-supreme-court-spy-chief.html">a constitutional crisis</a>..</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
