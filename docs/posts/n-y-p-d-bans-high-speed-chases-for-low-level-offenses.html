Tisch said in the statement. “The N.Y.P.D.’s enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk, and pursuits for violations and low-level crimes can be both potentially dangerous and unnecessary.”</p><p>The policy comes as New York’s streets are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/street-wars" title="">contested as never before</a>, with drivers competing not only with one another, but with pedestrians and riders of electric scooters and bicycles. Congestion pricing has officers looking for drivers who have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-ghost-cars-scams.html" title="">altered their license plates</a> to avoid toll readers. And legalized marijuana has created a morass as the police must contend not only with drivers who are high, but with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/20/nyregion/marijuana-driving-nyc.html" title="">how and when to apprehend them</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The new rules, which take effect Feb. 1, are a major reversal of the police’s approach since 2022. That year, pursuits began to climb significantly as the department faced a spike in car thefts and complaints of illegal scooters and motorbikes tearing down streets.</p><p>While cities like Boston, Washington and Chicago have kept strict policies in place, New York loosened its protocols, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a research group in Washington.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
