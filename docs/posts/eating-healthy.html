(Most of us don’t have a jar of, say, methyl cellulose in our pantries.)</p><p>These kinds of foods have become ubiquitous in the United States, and experts say they appear to be taking a toll on our health.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Times’s Well desk starts each January with a weeklong challenge to improve some aspect of our health. This year, the focus is on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/well/eat/ultraprocessed-food-challenge-signup.html" title="">reducing the ultraprocessed foods in our diets</a>. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain the science behind the challenge.</p><h2 id="link-612f2869">Health concerns</h2><p>Almost all food is processed in some way, whether it’s being chopped, frozen or cooked. But ultraprocessing is different. Ultraprocessed foods are formulations made using industrial methods.</p><p>Ultraprocessed foods often contain ingredients that enhance taste, texture and shelf life — things like hydrogenated oils, modified starches, emulsifiers, and artificial colors and sweeteners. Yes, my beloved sheet cake is an ultraprocessed food, but so are many products we might consider nutritious, like some packaged breads, flavored yogurts, vegan “meats” and protein shakes. Nearly three-quarters of the food supply in the U.S. is ultraprocessed, according to one estimate published in the journal Nature Communications.</p><p>Research suggests that diets high in ultraprocessed foods are linked to health concerns including cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and mental health disorders. And a small but influential study found that subjects who ate mainly ultraprocessed foods consumed about 500 more calories per day.</p><p>As my colleague Alice Callahan has reported, researchers don’t know what specifically in ultraprocessed foods may be affecting our health, and it might take years before they truly understand the connection. Even with all of the unknowns, though, many experts agree that eating fewer ultraprocessed foods can benefit your health.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5a983074">Cutting back</h2><p>I spent the last six months interviewing dozens of nutrition experts to better understand ultraprocessed foods. I learned that cutting back isn’t simply about willpower. Ultraprocessed foods are convenient, and some are cheaper than minimally processed foods. And many of them are engineered to be so irresistible that it’s challenging for us to stop eating them, even when we feel full.</p><p>It’s unrealistic to swear off all ultraprocessed foods forever, said Kevin Hall, a nutrition and metabolism researcher at the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>“Not all ultraprocessed foods are necessarily bad for you, nor should you think that you should try to get rid of them,” Hall said.</p><p>What’s more important, he added, is to focus on your overall eating pattern, rather than on individual foods — and there are tweaks you can make to help you do it.</p><p>Over the next five days, the Well Challenge will offer tips, guidance and inspiration to better understand ultraprocessed foods. The goal is not to completely overhaul your diet. (I, for one, am never giving up supermarket sheet cake.) Instead, we’ll explore simple ways to cut back, so you can be on your way to feeling better in the long term.

If you’re looking for one that encapsulates his decency, curiosity, eye for detail and appreciation of the natural world, “A Full Life” is an excellent place to start. Carter, who died this past week at 100, looks back on his first 90 years, including his time in the White House. You’ll learn about important policy initiatives, but you’ll also see the Carters on clandestine fly-fishing expeditions, bowling in their own basement and hashing out current events at the dinner table. The audiobook is narrated by the author himself — a voice of reason, with notes of pain and pride. A presidential yacht? Astronomical food bills? Unnecessary construction at Camp David? Not on his watch.</p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>In the mood for more books about Carter’s life? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/books/review/books-about-jimmy-carter.html" title="">Start here</a>.</p></li><li><p>The plagiarism plot is having a moment.

We spoke about his focus on strengthening America’s alliances, his view of diplomacy in a crisis-ridden world and the major conflicts that remain unresolved.</em></p><p><strong>We know that President-elect Trump has people that surround him that are very willing to see Ukraine cede territory to Russia. There has been no parallel diplomatic track, and the weapons are probably going to be drying up. Do you feel you’ve left Ukraine in the strongest position that you could have? Or were there things that you could have done differently?</strong></p><p>Well, first, what we left is Ukraine, which was not self-evident because Putin’s ambition was to erase it from the map. We stopped that. Putin has failed. Ukraine is standing. And I believe it also has extraordinary potential not only to survive, to thrive going forward. And that does depend on decisions that the future administration and many other countries will make.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>Do you think it’s time to end the war, though?</strong></p><p>These are decisions for Ukrainians to make. They have to decide where their future is and how they want to get there. Where the line is drawn on the map at this point, I don’t think is fundamentally going to change very much.</p><p><strong>You mean that the areas that Russia controls you feel will have to be ceded?</strong></p><p>Ceded is not the question. The question is the line, as a practical matter in the foreseeable future, is unlikely to move very much. Ukraine’s claim on that territory will always, always be there. And the question is, will they find ways with the support of others to regain territory that’s been lost? It’s unlikely that Putin will give up on his ambitions. If there’s a cease-fire, then, in Putin’s mind, the cease-fire is likely to give him time to rest, to reset, to re-attack at some point in the future.</p><p>So what’s going to be critical to make sure that any cease-fire that comes about is actually enduring is to make sure that Ukraine has the capacity going forward to deter further aggression. And that can come in many forms. It could come through NATO, and we put Ukraine on a path to NATO membership. It could come through security assurances, commitments, guarantees by different countries to make sure that Russia knows that if it re-attacks, it’s going to have a big problem.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/magazine/antony-blinken-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photograph by David Guttenfelder for The New York Times.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armando Rafael for The New York Times.
