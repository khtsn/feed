The game itself went smoothly, with Ajax winning easily, 5-0.</p><p>After the clashes, Maccabi called for its fans to <a href="https://x.com/MaccabiTLVFC/status/1854764918589079856" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quickly return to Israel</a>.</p><h2 id="link-4cf7e28">What happened before the game?</h2><p>Street disturbances began Wednesday night, a full day before the match, after Maccabi fans began arriving in Amsterdam.</p><p>The authorities in Amsterdam said supporters of Maccabi had taken down a Palestinian flag from a building. A video posted to social media and verified by The New York Times shows men climbing a building to tear down a Palestinian flag while others nearby shout anti-Arab chants. One man is heard saying in Hebrew, “The people of Israel live,” while others shout anti-Palestinian chants using expletives.</p><p>Peter Holla, Amsterdam’s police chief, said that on Wednesday night Maccabi fans had burned a Palestinian flag in Dam Square, a well-known plaza in the center of town, and had attacked a taxi; 10 people were detained, mostly on charges of disrupting public order.</p><p>Late that night, the police intervened to prevent a potential confrontation between several hundred Maccabi fans inside a casino and a group — including taxi drivers — that the authorities said had gathered after a social media call to “mobilize.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Thursday, at another square called Anton de Komplein, which is near the stadium, people protesting the arrival of Maccabi Tel Aviv clashed with the police, leading to dozens of arrests.</p><p>Amsterdam’s mayor, Femke Halsema, had prohibited the protest from happening outside the stadium. Ms. Halsema said her office was worried about the possibility of violence, since the match coincided with the commemoration of Kristallnacht, the night in 1938 when organized Nazi thugs looted Jewish businesses, burned down synagogues and attacked and arrested Jews in Germany.</p><h2 id="link-55563cdd">What happened before and after the game?</h2><p>The police deployed 800 officers to try to maintain order during the match, with the police escorting Israeli fans and pro-Palestinian demonstrators, in a bid to keep the two sides apart.</p><p>Videos showed Israeli fans shouting anti-Arab chants on their way to the match as the police escorted them near Amsterdam’s central train station. Their chants included, “Let the IDF win,” and, “Why is there no school in Gaza? There are no children left there.”</p><p>After the match, violence erupted in the city center. The Dutch police said some people riding scooters had kicked and beaten Israeli fans in hit-and-run attacks, while others pelted them with fireworks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Israeli Embassy in the Netherlands <a href="https://x.com/IsraelinNL/status/1854773621249786333" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that hundreds of Maccabi fans in Amsterdam had been attacked after the game as they made their way back to their hotels.</p><p>“Mobs chanted anti-Israel slogans and proudly shared videos of their violent acts on social media — kicking, beating, even running over Israeli citizens,” the embassy said on <a href="https://x.com/IsraelinNL/status/1854773621249786333" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p><h2 id="link-8f1f143">How have authorities responded?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Femke Halsema of Amsterdam addressed the news media on Friday after violence erupted overnight.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Koen Van Weel/ANP/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The police have detained four people over the attacks on Israeli fans, including a 26-year-old man who was arrested on Friday after police identified him from online footage.</p><p>Israel warned its citizens in Amsterdam to avoid wearing Israeli or Jewish symbols in public and told soccer fans to fly back to Israel as soon as possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Amsterdam, the Dutch capital, remained under emergency order over the weekend. The order mobilized more police officers, giving them the power to stop and search people. It also banned demonstrations and prohibited the wearing of anything that covers a person’s face.</p><p>The authorities also ordered additional security for Jewish institutions.</p><p>The attacks have also led to political fallout. The far-right leader Geert Wilders, whose anti-Muslim party is the largest party in the Dutch Parliament, took to social media to attack what he called “radical Islam,” using incendiary language.</p><p>Mr. Wilders also met with Gideon Saar, Israel’s newly appointed foreign minister, who traveled to the Netherlands in the wake of the incident.</p><p>On the other side of the political spectrum, Stephan van Baarle, the leader of DENK, a small political party focused on protecting diversity in the Netherlands, blamed the authorities for failing to stop what he called provocations by Israeli fans.</p><p>“Where were the police when Maccabi thugs chanted genocidal and racist slogans about Gaza?” he said in a video posted to the party’s website.</p><p>The Amsterdam police say they have launched a broad investigation and have asked members of the public to come forward with relevant images and information.</p><p>Claire Moses<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div><div><p>Christopher F.
