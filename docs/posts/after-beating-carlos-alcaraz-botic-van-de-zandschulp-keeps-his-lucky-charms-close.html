Coming from a player ranked No. 74 in the world, it may have seemed shocking, but Mr. van de Zandschulp has enjoyed the greatest successes of his career at the Open.</p><p>In 2021 he went from qualifying all the way to the quarterfinal stage, and then he turned the men’s singles draw upside down this week.</p><p>Watching from the player’s box were Mr. van de Zandschulp’s two secret weapons in New York: the Pham brothers, a pair of American former players who speak Dutch and help their childhood pal from a Dutch youth tennis program to feel at home. And they will be cheering him on again Saturday, when Mr. van de Zandschulp faces 25th-seeded Jack Draper of Britain in the third round.</p><p>But Richard and Victor Pham, both Manhattan financiers, had not been in contact with their boyhood friend for 15 years until they reunited during his first trip to the United States in 2021, when Mr. van de Zandschulp made his electrifying run to the quarterfinals. It started a tradition the three men carry on today.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Every time I’m coming here, I have dinner with them and they come to all my matches,” Mr. van Der Zandschulp said on Friday. “And every time it is working out pretty well.”</p><p>The Phams met first Mr. van de Zandschulp, now 28, when they were boys in the Netherlands. The Pham brothers, born in Denmark to Vietnamese immigrants, began playing tennis, and played it well. Richard, now 29, hit alongside Mr. van de Zandschulp at one of the Dutch tennis federation’s training facilities when he was about 8, and eventually they were joined by his Victor, who is three years younger.</p><p>The three were close then, but when the Pham brothers were around 13 and 10, the family moved to San Jose, Calif. And though they still spoke Dutch at home and continued to play competitive tennis, they lost track of their old tennis buddy from the Netherlands, who was rising in the ranks in Europe.</p><p>Both Phams went to Columbia University and played varsity tennis; Victor was named the Ivy League Player of the Year two years in a row. After graduation, Victor flirted with a professional career but could not overcome a wrist injury. The brothers chose careers in finance and settled on the Upper West Side.</p><p>All the while, Victor kept track of Mr. van de Zandschulp on tennis websites. In August 2021, he noticed that Mr. van de Zandschulp, who was then ranked No. 118 in the world, had made it into the U.S. Open qualifying draw, a kind of pretournament tournament that allows 16 men and 16 women into the main draws.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Phams reached out on Instagram and Mr. van de Zandschulp, delighted, suggested they meet at a restaurant near his hotel in Midtown Manhattan.</p><p>“We chatted about life and caught up about the last 15 years,” Victor Pham said. “It was great to see him, and then he just kept winning.”</p><p>Mr. van de Zandschulp won his three qualifying matches and then his first two rounds in the main draw, including a big upset of Casper Ruud, the No. 11 seed.</p><p>As long as he was winning, Mr. van de Zandschulp kept eating at the same restaurant with the Phams near his hotel, and they kept on going to his matches. At the time, he had no private traveling coach, no agent and no clothing sponsors. His “team” at the time basically consisted of Richard and Victor; their headquarters was the Midtown chain restaurant.</p><p>“Tennis players can be very superstitious,” Victor Pham said. “So we had a reunion there every night.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the next two years Mr. van de Zandschulp lost in the second round of the Open. So when he met up with the Phams this year, he picked another lucky spot on 46th Street and then blitzed Alcaraz. It was his first win over a top-3 player and the first time he has beaten a major champion.</p><p>A recent series of injuries and early-round losses made Mr. van de Zandschulp, currently ranked No. 74, wonder if tennis was right for him. When he lost in the first round of the French Open in May, he mulled retirement, despite earning over $4 million playing the sport.</p><p>He took about three weeks off before Wimbledon (he lost in the second round) to recalibrate, then returned refreshed. Besides, if he did retire, what would he do then? “I have no idea,” he said Friday, and repeated it twice more.</p><p>It certainly seemed the right decision when he shocked Alcaraz, and reminded the New York crowd that when he is in town, remarkable things can happen.</p><p>“I once said to him, ‘What’s the difference in New York?’” Victor Pham said with a laugh. “It’s me and Richard in his box and having dinner with him. We are his lucky charms.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
