Mr. Hegseth’s comments, at the opening of a large grouping of nations that support Ukraine, will not come as a great surprise, but they mark a major change from former President Biden’s policy on Ukraine, which was to support Kyiv in its effort to drive Russian forces out of the entirety of sovereign Ukraine.</p><p>NATO has promised that Ukraine will one day become a member of NATO, but without specifying a date. Mr. Hegseth’s comments would appear to put that date very far into the unforeseeable future, if it arrives at all.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth’s remarks will create political difficulties for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and are likely to please President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who since 2014, and especially with his all-out invasion three years ago, has occupied about 20 percent of the country.</p><p>Mr. Putin has also demanded that Russia keep its occupied territories, that Ukraine not join NATO, that its military capacity be limited and that NATO enlargement should halt. He has said he is willing to join negotiations on a settlement with Ukraine, but only on his terms.</p><p>To help bring Mr. Putin to the negotiating table, Mr. Hegseth urged lower energy prices, “coupled with more effective enforcement of energy sanctions.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The United States “remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe, full stop, but the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency,” Mr. Hegseth said.</p><p>So Europe must step up to take responsibility for its own conventional defense, he said, while implying that the American nuclear umbrella that helps protect NATO and Europe would remain in place.</p><p>He urged Europeans to keep their commitments on military spending and increase them. “We challenge your countries and your citizens to double down and recommit yourselves not only to Ukraine’s immediate security needs, but to Europe’s long term defense and deterrence goals,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth took no questions.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Steven Erlanger is the chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe and is based in Berlin.
