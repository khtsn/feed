    <h1>Trump Received an Unconditional Discharge. What Does That Mean?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday, Justice Juan M. Merchan sentenced Donald J. Trump to an unconditional discharge, a rare and lenient sentence in New York state courts that still cements Mr. Trump’s status as a felon before his inauguration.</p><p>A conditional discharge would have required him to meet certain conditions, like maintaining employment or paying restitution, but Mr. Trump will not be subject to any requirements going forward.</p><p>The outcome was expected: Last week, in <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFs/press/PDFs/People%20v.%20DJT%20Clayton%20Decision.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an 18-page decision</a>, Justice Merchan said that he planned to give Mr. Trump an unconditional discharge, writing that it “appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, who was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal, had originally faced probation or up to four years in prison, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/nyregion/donald-trump-merchan-sentencing-jail.html" title="">New York Times analysis</a> revealed that Justice Merchan had ample ground to consider incarceration.</p></div></div>
