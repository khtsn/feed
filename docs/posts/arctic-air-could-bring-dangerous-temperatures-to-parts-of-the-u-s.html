Water filled the street and sidewalks six inches deep in some spots before partially freezing.</p><p>“People in Wisconsin are generally pretty hardy,” said Emma Nelson, a chief election inspector. “But there’s a lot of people that, if they were already on the fence about coming down, this weather may be prohibitive for them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The National Weather Service warned that this “widespread extreme cold threat” would send temperatures plunging 30 degrees below average near the Canadian border for the next couple of mornings. Numerous daily temperature records were likely to be broken, with below-zero high temperatures from Montana and the Dakotas to the upper Midwest and sections of the Central Plains. Freezing conditions may reach even the Gulf Coast by Thursday morning.</p><p>Extreme cold warnings and cold-weather advisories were issued for areas across the northern Plains and upper Midwest down to central Texas, potentially affecting millions of people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Weather Prediction Center warned of dangerous wind chill temperatures capable of causing frostbite within minutes. In the Northern Plains, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-the-wind-chill-index.html" title="">wind chills</a> between minus 30 and minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit could persist for several days.</p><p>Jeremy Reha was outside Food Bank of Iowa’s warehouse on Des Moines’ East Side before dawn Tuesday morning, starting up refrigeration units on trucks in minus 12 degree weather. The same diesel engines that keep donated grapefruits, apples, and eggs cool in summer work as heaters inside the truck boxes on days like today, he said, when drivers haul food to meal sites and pantries throughout Central Iowa.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Dressed in layers topped off with a Chicago Bears cap (“I’ve had a rough last 30 years or so,” he joked), Mr. Reha said he left some trucks running all night to keep their diesel fuel from turning to gelatin.</p><p>“If our trucks aren’t running, we can’t feed people,” Mr. Reha said, adding that Tuesday was among the coldest days he had seen in his 12 years with the nonprofit.</p><p>The office of the Weather Service in Bismarck, N.D., described the conditions as “life threatening,” cautioning that wind chills in western and central North Dakota could lead to hypothermia.</p><p>Subzero wind chills are also expected to extend as far south as Texas, Arkansas and western Tennessee and Kentucky.</p><h2 id="link-753e8bbc">Winter storm expected for the nation’s midsection.</h2><p>In addition to the extreme cold, snow and gusty winds are expected Tuesday across the Central Plains, including parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri. The Weather Prediction Center said up to a foot of snow could fall by Wednesday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Much of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas are “looking at snowfall accumulations of eight to 12 inches, and it’s possible a couple of places might just get slightly higher,” said Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist from the National Weather Service.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="18wea-winter-map" data-id="100000009996843" data-source-id="100000009996843"><div slug="18wea-winter-map" data-sourceid="100000009996843" id="embed-id-100000009996843">

Southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina could see up to eight inches.
