Numerous daily temperature records were likely to be broken, with below-zero high temperatures from Montana and the Dakotas to the upper Midwest and sections of the Central Plains. Freezing conditions may reach even the Gulf Coast by Thursday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Extreme cold warnings and cold-weather advisories were issued for areas across the northern Plains and upper Midwest down to central Texas, potentially affecting millions of people.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Weather Prediction Center warned of dangerous wind chill temperatures capable of causing frostbite within minutes. In the Northern Plains, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-the-wind-chill-index.html" title="">wind chills</a> between minus 30 and minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit could persist for several days.</p><p>The office of the Weather Service in Bismarck, N.D., described the conditions as “life threatening,” cautioning that wind chills in western and central North Dakota could lead to hypothermia.</p><p>Subzero wind chills are also expected to extend as far south as Texas, Arkansas and western Tennessee and Kentucky.</p><h2 id="link-753e8bbc">Winter storm expected for the nation’s midsection.</h2><p>In addition to the extreme cold, snow and gusty winds are expected Tuesday across the Central Plains, including parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri.

Forecasters in New York said the storm would pass far enough south and east to spare the area any significant snowfall.</p><p>Temperatures will slowly moderate over the weekend, though Mr. Robinson Cook noted that “they will still be below average, but not as bitterly cold.”</p><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
