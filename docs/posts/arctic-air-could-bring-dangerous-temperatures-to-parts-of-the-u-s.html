Southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina could see up to eight inches. Snow was expected in parts of Tennessee and Kentucky that were hit by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/us/kentucky-storm-damage.html" title="">deadly flooding</a> over the weekend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Governor Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia confirmed on Tuesday that a second person had died in his state’s floods. Both deaths happened in McDowell County, W.V.</p><p>Significant icing from freezing rain was also expected over southeastern North Carolina, with a wintry mix moving into the interior Deep South early Wednesday.</p><p>The storm is forecast to track off the East Coast Wednesday night into Thursday morning. “Current models suggest that most of the winter weather will stay south of New England,” said Ashton Robinson Cook, a meteorologist with the Weather Service. Forecasters in New York said the storm would pass far enough south and east to spare the area any significant snowfall.</p><p>Temperatures will slowly moderate over the weekend, though Mr. Robinson Cook noted that “they will still be below average, but not as bitterly cold.”</p><p>In the Upper Midwest, many residents — including the animals — shrugged off the cold. After odd warming events and extreme weather driven by climate change, a cold snap felt like a return to normalcy. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Milwaukee Water Works was dealing with numerous water main breaks across the city, in already this month, municipal workers had dealt with 50 similar cases, 130 water main breaks this winter in all.</p><p>Horses at the Animal Rescue League of Iowa’s Second Chance Ranch near Des Moines kicked up their heels in their outdoor pens on Tuesday and nipped playfully at one another when a supervisor, Chloe Catron, and a care technician, Brooklyn Wright, drove up shortly after dawn for their morning feeding, which included extra hay and a little alfalfa for added calories.</p><p>The horses prefer to be outside even on nights like last night, when the mercury dipped to minus 12, Ms. Catron said.</p><p>By midmorning, the horses, most rescued from neglect and hoarding situations, stood in the sunshine munching hay and grain. The humans had the tougher job, going outdoors to conduct health checks and make sure water heaters were working. </p><p>“You warm up,” Ms. Catron said, “and then go back and do what you’ve got to do.”</p><p>Judson Jones<!-- -->, Addison Lathers in Milwaukee and Ann Hinga Klein in Des Moines contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-15"></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
