The next works will be installed this winter, with the full slate planned for a 2026 grand opening.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An artwork made up of a long transparent tube with multicolored stripes sits on a snowy slope." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/15/multimedia/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp/SNOW-ART-01-wfhp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2000w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Relay (Powder Mountain),” 2023, by Gerard &amp; Kelly.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Drew Rane/Carlson, via Powder Mountain</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The artworks can be skied to or hiked to, and are open to the public. This winter’s debuts include commissioned pieces by EJ Hill, best known for his ridable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/arts/design/ej-hill-roller-coaster-mass-moca-art.html" title="">indoor roller coaster work</a> at Mass MoCA, who will create art on the ski lifts, and the Los Angeles sculptor Davina Semo, who is making three large-scale bells that produce different tones when rung.</p><p>The full program, still being set, will also include an extant work, James Turrell’s walk-in light installation “Ganzfeld Apani” (2011), which was featured at the Venice Biennale; a piece by the land-art legend Nancy Holt (1938-2014), famous for her Utah work “Sun Tunnels”; and new commissions by the sculptor and Utah native Paul McCarthy and the text-based artist Jenny Holzer.</p><p>Hastings, an avid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/travel/reed-hastings-ski-utah-snowboard.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">skier</a>, gave credit to Powder Mountain’s chief creative officer, Alex Zhang, for driving the idea forward. Their inspirations include Desert X, an exhibition in the Coachella Valley of California, and the installations on the Japanese “art islands” of Naoshima and Teshima.</p><p>The Powder Mountain works will be owned by a nonprofit organization that is being set up by Hastings.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Reed Hastings, a founder of Netflix, is an avid skier and snowboarder.

He collaborated on the selections with Diana Nawi, who was recently hired as a contemporary curator at the Los Angeles museum.</p><p>The challenge is siting the works on the 12,000-acre property. “With most traditional sculpture parks, they’re an English garden notion of the picturesque — walk up, walk around and walk away,” Thompson said. “But this is an adventurous site with an outdoor adventure company.”</p><p>Thompson added, “All the works will connect you to the landscape. We’re not plopping them in a field.”</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Turrell’s “Ganzfeld Apani,” originally commissioned for and displayed at the 54th Venice Biennale, will be installed at Powder Mountain.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Florian Holzherr, via Powder Mountain</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Florian Holzherr, via Powder Mountain</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>He cited Turrell’s “Ganzfeld Apani” as a “no-brainer first gesture,” given that the artist’s work is about perception, and will have broad views “looking out to the infinite.” It will be within walking distance from the main Powder Mountain parking lot. Turrell’s title refers to the Ganzfeld effect, the inability to perceive a uniform field, of which snow blindness is a prime example.</p><p>McCarthy, who lives in Los Angeles, grew up outside of Salt Lake City. “Since I left in the ’60s, I’ve never really made anything or done much there,” he said. “But I know that Utah affected me — you can’t get away from it. They’re in my sculptures, those cliff and mountain forms.”</p><p>McCarthy said his work would be sited somewhere “visually remote” and would take the form of an Alpine hut. He said he was considering wood, rock and stone as materials, and he was also toying with making a film there once the structure is complete.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The artist Paul McCarthy looks over a site on Powder Mountain.

That work addressed the way amusement park attractions were once racially segregated.</p></div><div><div><p>In an email, Hill, who is Black, said his field could be described as “amusement aesthetics.”</p><p>Hill said while the trip up, on the lift, is thought of as “more forgettable than the rest of the ride,” it is “arguably the most essential part.” He added, “lift engineers, designers and artists can use these moments to cultivate an even deeper sense of excitement for what’s to come.”</p><p>The ski lift works will use reclaimed carousel horses and roller coaster cars as a sculptural element on the lift system, Hill said. “Something to help elevate, quite literally, these bygone beings and vehicles. Give them a new life and renewed purpose.”</p><p>Skiing is a traditionally white sport, which may give Hill’s work another layer of meaning. In February he went to Powder Mountain, where he skied for the first time, “when someone that I trust invited me,” he said, referring to Thompson.</p><p>Hill added that the experience made him think of Adrian Piper’s installation “Safe #1-4” (1990). “I think that’s what we’re all after in large and small ways — to feel safe,” he said. “To be included. To be counted, to be regarded. To be seen.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/james-turrell">James Turrell</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="push-what-to-watch" data-id="100000007731011" data-source-id="100000007731011"><div><!--
