Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin,​ was offering hugs to his fans when the Japanese woman abruptly kissed him on his​ cheek.</p><p>Video footage that went viral showed Jin looking uncomfortable when a couple of female fans tried to kiss him. Subsequently, someone filed a formal legal complaint on a government website, which the authorities can react to if they consider them worthy of investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The South Korean police have since identified a Japanese woman with the help of Japanese police, said the Songpa police station in southern Seoul.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>BTS member Jin during the event where the incident took place in Seoul, in June in 2024, in this still image obtained from a social media video.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">@Seoshoom, via X, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>If the ​woman accepts the summons, she ​will face questioning on possible charges of sexual harassment, the police station said. They didn’t say what additional steps they might take if she did not oblige.</p><p>It did not provide personal details on the woman, but South Korean news media said the woman ​was in her 50s ​and bragged online about how her lips had touched Jin’s “soft” skin.</p><p>​Hybe, the firm that created and manages the boy band, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Despite historical disputes rooted in Japan’s colonial rule of Korea in the early ​20th century, South Korea and Japan maintain ​brisk tourist exchanges. South Korean TV dramas and K-pop groups like BTS are a major attraction for Japanese fans, who visit locations where the dramas were​ filmed or attend K-pop fan meetings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>BTS has a legion of global fans who call themselves the BTS “<a href="https://www.usbtsarmy.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Army.</a>” ​</p><p>Like all other eligible young South Korean men, the seven boy-band members were obliged to finish military service. That led to a pause for one of the biggest musical acts in the world​.</p><p>Jin, 32, the oldest member of the band​, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/world/asia/bts-military-service-south-korea.html" title="">the first</a> to join the military in 2022.​ The band’s management has said that the group would ​reconvene this year once all its members are back from military service.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
