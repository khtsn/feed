The United States publicly agreed with that assessment on Wednesday, saying that Pyongyang had moved at least 3,000 soldiers to several training camps in the Russian Far East, not far from the North Korean border. Even President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/europe/putin-north-korean-troops-russia.html" title="">appeared to acknowledge</a> the presence of Pyongyang’s forces in his country. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Thursday, Ukraine <a href="https://t.me/DIUkraine/4723" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed 12,000 North Korean troops</a> were now in Russia, adding that some had arrived in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion.html" title="">Kursk region</a>, where Ukraine has held territory since staging an incursion in August. On Friday, John Kirby, the national security spokesman at the White House, said it was possible that some North Korean troops could be deployed to Kursk. The Times could not independently confirm whether any North Korean troops are in Kursk.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The footage from Sergeyevka was posted on Telegram by Astra, a Russian independent media organization, along with another clip that showed soldiers milling around, chatting and smoking.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/00vid-nk-russia-soldiers-alliesarrived-11147-cover/00vid-nk-russia-soldiers-alliesarrived-11147-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Troops, who are referred to on camera as North Korean, at a training facility in Sergeyevka, Russia.

That would allow them to pose as people from eastern Siberia, where the Indigenous Buryat and Yakut people bear Asian facial features.</p><p>In another video, released by a Ukrainian government agency, the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, dozens of soldiers can be seen standing in a long line inside a building. The Ukrainian agency, which was established to counter Russian disinformation, <a href="https://spravdi.gov.ua/en/eksklyuzyv-yak-pivnichnokorejskyh-soldativ-ekipiruyut-u-rosijske-sporyadzhennya/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the video showed North Korean soldiers preparing for deployment at a training facility in Sergeyevka.</p><p>The Ukrainian agency was not willing to provide the original video file or details about the video’s provenance to The Times. The Times could not confirm the exact location or time the video was filmed. However, the interior matches military cafeteria design in Russia and Ukraine. It is possible the video was filmed at a building in the Sergeyevka complex; the windows resemble those seen on a building adjacent to the military barracks where the apparent North Korean soldiers were recorded milling around. There are also signs of increased activity at the building: fencing between the building and the barracks was recently taken down, and trash and cars are visible in satellite imagery outside the building for the first time in years.</p><p>The footage contains the voices of soldiers speaking with a distinctively North Korean accent, said Kim Seung-chul, a defector from North Korea who heads North Korea Reform Radio, a Seoul-based station that broadcasts outside news into North Korea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/00vid-nk-russia-soldiers-fool-27473-cover/00vid-nk-russia-soldiers-fool-27473-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In a room filled with boxes from a Russian company, troops are captured waiting in line, dressed in Russian uniforms and speaking in a North Korean dialect.
