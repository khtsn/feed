That included setting the limits on testosterone levels and sometimes deeming how long athletes must suppress their testosterone before being eligible to compete.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-trans-athletes-executive-order.html" title="">executive order</a> is based on the administration’s interpretation of Title IX, the 1972 civil rights law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding. Barring transgender girls and women from women’s sports was one of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises.</p><p>“From now on, women’s sports will be only for women,” he said on Wednesday after signing the order, as a group of female athletes surrounded him.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
