And he waxed poetic about his love of Broadway shows of a certain vintage, especially Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats.”</p><p>He recounted attending the Broadway premiere of “Cats” decades ago, saying that he had gone to see the musical with “somebody I should not have been there with,” and that they were seated in the fourth row. (“They were treating me good because I was a young star, for whatever reason,” he said. “This is a crazy life I’ve had.”)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump said he was initially turned off by the sight of dozens of dancers lying onstage. (He recalled thinking: “You’ve got to be kidding. Let’s get out of here.”) But then he had a change of heart.</p><p>“I walked in, I saw all these bodies, and then I noticed those bodies were gorgeous,” Mr. Trump said. “They had silk tights on, and they were all ballerinas, and women from Broadway. And men.” About the men, he added: “I didn’t find those particular bodies as attractive to be honest.”</p><p>After a board member asked if there were any new musicals that were not “totally woke,” somebody replied that, in a break with the past, the center would be doing some shows not affiliated with Actors’ Equity, the union representing actors. The person said that the change “opens us up for a whole bunch of more options as well as a lot more money.”</p><h3 id="link-58733ca9"><span>He wants to remake the Kennedy Center Honors, which he said celebrated “radical left lunatics.”</span></h3><p>Mr. Trump has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/arts/music/trump-kennedy-center-honors.html" title="">preoccupied with the Kennedy Center Honors</a>, the annual awards ceremony, since his first term, after several artists being honored <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/kennedy-center-honors.html" title="">criticized him</a>. In response, the president boycotted the ceremony, breaking with tradition.</p><p>At the meeting on Monday, Mr. Trump complained that the center had been celebrating “radical left lunatics” and proposed giving posthumous awards to Pavarotti, Presley and Ruth. (Artists being honored posthumously, of course, cannot weigh in on current politics. Pavarotti, who died in 2007, had already been honored by the Kennedy Center in 2001; in 2016 his heirs asked Mr. Trump to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/arts/music/luciano-pavarotti-donald-trump-soundtrack.html" title="">stop playing his recordings</a> at campaign rallies.)</p><p>Kennedy Center Honors have traditionally been bestowed on artists. But Mr. Trump suggested they might also look to the world of sports, politics and business, naming the casino mogul Steve Wynn, a major Republican donor, as a potential recipient. (Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Wynn’s wife, Andrea, to the Kennedy Center’s board.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“You could do entrepreneurs, you could do people that, you know, that were really in charge of show business,” he said. “I would say you could do politicians, you could do sports stars.”</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>You could do a guy like Steve Wynn.

And the host was always terrible.” (Queen Latifah <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/arts/kennedy-center-honors.html" title="">was the host last year.</a>)</p><p>Then he offered an idea for who might host the show: himself.</p><p>“Believe me, I don’t want to do it, I don’t want to do it,” he said.</p><p>“I have enough publicity,” he said. “They’ll say, ‘Trump wants to be the host.’ I don’t want to.

(The center, like other federally owned properties, has deferred some maintenance because of budget constraints.)</p><p>He said the center should build a band shell on the Potomac, an idea officials have considered over the years. And, sounding like a real estate developer, he said he wanted to cover the center’s signature columns with marble or granite.</p><p>“They never covered the I-beam,” he said. He added: “I think the I-beams should be covered with some incredible stone — probably marble, but marble’s a bad outdoor stone, but looks better than granite. But it should be covered. And we’ll do that. We’ll add that in. But it’s not a small job.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>To pay for his plans at the center, Mr. Trump said he would seek money from Congress to help “bring it back.” After touring the center, he said he was surprised by its size. And he took a swipe at his predecessor.</p><p>“I had no idea how big it was, because I just walked the whole place,” he said. “Believe me, Biden couldn’t have done it. He would not have been able to walk the place.”</p><p>He said that “the whole place needs work,” including the main hall.</p><p>Mr. Trump criticized the center’s 2019 expansion, a privately funded project which cost $250 million and which added a complex of smaller spaces for rehearsals and performances, gardens, an outdoor video wall, classrooms and a cafe. Mr. Trump described it as “all this nonsense” and complained of “crazy rooms.”</p><p>“Think of it: They got $250 million,” he said. “I’m trying to figure out where they spent it. Somebody made a lot of money, that I can tell you.”</p><p>Mr. Trump praised the new Kennedy Center board, which is packed with more than 30 of his allies, including several donors to his campaign. (He joked, however, that some members “didn’t give me anything; they probably won’t be here too long.”)</p><p>Then, as the new chairman prepared to call his meeting to a close, Mr. Trump thanked the board members for their service.</p><p>“But you know what? It’s good to see you,” he said. “Thank you very much. You’re really amazing, actually.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Elvis, ‘Cats’ and Ruth: Chairman Trump Reimagines Kennedy Center<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Deportations:</strong> The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-venezuela-deportations-doj-court-order.html">asked a federal judge to dissolve the orders he put in place</a> barring it from deporting suspected members of a Venezuelan street gang from the country under a rarely invoked wartime statute called the Alien Enemies Act.</p></li><li><p><strong>Medical Research at Columbia:</strong> Dozens of medical and scientific studies are ending or at risk of ending, leaving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/nyregion/columbia-research-grants-trump.html">researchers scrambling to find alternative funding</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Military Academies:</strong> President Trump moved to stack the boards overseeing U.S. military service academies with conservative activists and political allies, including Michael T.
