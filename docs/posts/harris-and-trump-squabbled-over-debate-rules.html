Her team said it wants both microphones to remain on throughout the entire debate, rather than muting the person who isn’t speaking. The effort seems to be aimed at turning Trump’s proclivity for speaking off the cuff and out of turn against him.</p><p>Such squabbles over debate rules might seem minor, but the last presidential debate proved to be the turning point that convinced many top Democrats that they needed a new candidate. My colleague Jess Bidgood, who writes the On Politics newsletter, said the debate could easily be <em>the </em>defining moment in a historically brief presidential campaign.</p><p><strong>Here’s what else to know:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Trump and Harris strike starkly different tones on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/us/politics/trump-harris-poverty-policies.html" title="">how to fight poverty</a>.</p></li><li><p>Harris has become tougher on immigration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/harris-democrats-immigration.html" title="">but the subject remains a political vulnerability</a> for Democrats.</p></li><li><p>North Carolina’s rural voters could swing the election.

Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s leader, condemned the assault as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missiles-kyiv.html" title="">“one of the largest strikes”</a> of the 30-month-old war. </p><p>The barrage damaged energy facilities across the country and caused residents of Kyiv to seek shelter in basements and subways. Multiple cities reported blackouts, and officials said that four people had been killed and more than 30 injured. The strikes occurred as Ukraine’s troops continued to advance, slowly, into Russian territory. </p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pavel Durov, Telegram’s founder, in 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-532303ad">French officials explained the Telegram founder’s arrest</h2><p>Prosecutors in France announced today that Pavel Durov, the founder of the Telegram messaging platform, was arrested outside Paris over the weekend in connection with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/business/telegram-founder-arrest-france.html" title="">an investigation into criminal activity on the app</a> and a lack of cooperation with law enforcement.
