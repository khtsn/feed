But she concluded, “We have to orient less toward who is the better candidate and more toward what is the better antiwar approach in building our collective power.”</p><p>The message, posted on all major social media platforms, was a marked shift for the group, which has made significant demands of Ms. Harris with little result. Those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/us/politics/democratic-convention-uncommitted.html" title="">demands have included</a> an arms embargo against Israel, prominent speaking slots for Palestinian rights groups at the Democratic convention and a change to the party’s platform that would move U.S. foreign policy away from Israel.</p><p>But in the video, Ms. Zeidan, a Palestinian American, bluntly said a second term for former President Donald J. Trump would be worse than a Harris victory. She detailed how Mr. Trump tilted U.S. foreign policy strongly toward the Israeli government in his first term and floated plans that “effectively dismantled any pathway to Palestinian self-determination.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The video takes particular aim at Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint for a Republican presidency that was crafted in part by allies of Mr. Trump, who has tried to distance itself from its proposals, which include eliminating humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank while stifling pro-Palestinian protests at home. The video includes clips of David Friedman, Mr. Trump’s former ambassador to Israel, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/us/politics/trump-gaza.html" title="">have proposed expulsions from Gaza and annexation</a> of the occupied territories by Israel. It also shows a top Trump donor, Miriam Adelson, promising that the former president would pursue the Israeli far right’s policy aims without regard to world opinion.</p><p>“It’s clear Netanyahu will be doing everything in his power to get Trump elected,” Ms. Zeidan concluded, referring to Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. “And we have to do everything in our power to stop him.”</p><p>Uncommitted’s shift could be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/michigan-harris-arab-muslim-jewish-voters.html" title="">significant in a key swing state, Michigan</a>, which has <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2023/09/26/arab-americans-now-a-majority-in-dearborn-new-census-data-shows/70929525007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 300,000 residents</a> of Middle Eastern or North African ancestry. Polling of those voters is scant, but anecdotal information indicates many are reluctant to vote for Ms. Harris, and some are shifting to third-party candidates like the Green Party’s Jill Stein.</p><p>The Democratic Party of Michigan and the Harris campaign have made overtures intended to bring those voters back into the fold, but the Trump campaign has quietly courted them as well.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Weisman is a politics writer, covering campaigns with an emphasis on economic and labor policy.
