The F.A.A. is investigating.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Unlike the Philadelphia facility, which mainly guides planes landing at or taking off from Newark, the facility in Colorado oversees planes during their journeys. The aircraft are typically higher in the sky, more spaced out and moving at steady speeds. There are about two dozen such facilities nationwide each covering more than 100,000 square miles of airspace.</p><p>The outage was reported earlier by the ABC affiliate Denver7. According to the station, almost two dozen pilots headed to Denver International Airport were unable to contact air traffic control for six minutes on Monday afternoon.</p><p>According to FlightAware, a flight tracking service, the Denver airport, the biggest in Colorado, had a relatively uneventful day on Monday. Just two flights were canceled and fewer than 300 had been delayed. United Airlines is the largest airline at the airport, commanding about 38 percent of flights there. Southwest Airlines is the next largest, with a 32 percent share, <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?20=E" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to federal data</a>.</p><p>In a statement, United said the outage did not disrupt its operations. Southwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
