The chancellor said Germany “would not accept” suggestions from outsiders about how to run its democracy — or directives to work with such a party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“That is not done, certainly not among friends and allies,” Mr. Scholz said. “Where our democracy goes from here is for us to decide.”</p><p>Attendees at Mr. Vance’s speech had been expecting to hear details of the Trump administration’s plans for Ukraine peace talks and NATO defense policies. On Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine himself put the focus on the Ukraine war in his remarks, starkly laying out the threat from Russia’s battle-hardened military and making an impassioned appeal for Europeans to take their security into their own hands, including by forming an “Army of Europe” that would supplement U.S. power on the continent.</p><p>His speech drew standing ovations, in contrast to Mr. Vance’s speech the day before.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President JD Vance departing Munich, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Leah Millis</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Scholz’s comments underscored a growing unease among Europe’s leaders about their relationship with the United States, and their own domestic politics. They came as leaders scrambled at the summit to formulate a response to President Trump’s sudden shift in Ukraine policy — and the possibility that he could cut the continent out of negotiations.</p><p>Just a few days before Mr. Vance’s remarks, Mr. Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on virtually every country the United States trades with. Then he spoke of negotiating an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine directly with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, leaving Europeans, including Ukraine, wondering if they would be included. Poland’s foreign minister said at the conference that President Emmanuel Macron of France had called an emergency meeting of European leaders to discuss Ukraine on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the same time, far-right parties across Europe have gained ground by tapping into unease over immigration, which also helped propel Mr. Trump back to power in the United States. Mr. Vance’s comments suggested that a new kind of American alliance with Europe was forming, one that bypasses the official leadership in favor of movements like Germany’s AfD and France’s National Rally.</p><p>Saturday’s sessions of the security conference were dominated by reactions, predominantly negative, to Mr. Vance’s speech — and Mr. Trump’s agenda.</p><p>Mr. Scholz was joined in his criticism by Friedrich Merz, his rival as the chancellor candidate for the conservative Christian Democrats, who polls suggest is the favorite to be Germany’s next leader.</p><p>Mr. Vance spent much of his speech on Friday scolding Europeans for what he suggested were Soviet-style restrictions on free speech across the continent. On Saturday, Mr. Merz defended Germany’s laws that prohibit particular forms of speech, including hate speech and banned Nazi slogans, including on social media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Friedrich Merz, candidate for chancellor, denouncing Mr. Vance’s speech, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thomas Kienzle/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He also suggested that Mr. Trump’s administration was suppressing speech in the United States, after it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/white-house-ap-gulf-of-mexico.html" title="">moved on Friday to kick The Associated Press out of reporting pools</a> and off Mr. Trump’s plane because the news agency refuses to go along with Mr. Trump’s directive to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>“</strong>We stick to the rules which are given by our democratic institutions,” Mr. Merz said. “Free speech remains free speech and remains part of our open, democratic society. And fake news, hate speech and offenses remain subject to legal restraints and controlled by independent courts.”</p><p>“I think I should say,” he added, “that in front of the events which took place in D.C. yesterday — we would never kick out the news agency, out of the press room of our chancellor.”</p><p>Mr. Merz also criticized Mr. Trump’s tariff policy, saying that Germany wanted to reduce tariffs, not increase them, and that “we don’t believe in trade conflicts.”</p><p>The White House had no immediate comment on the remarks by Mr. Scholz and Mr. Merz.</p><p>The comments were the latest in a series of critiques of Mr. Vance’s speech from German politicians before the election next Sunday. Mr. Scholz’s Social Democrats are running third or fourth in most polls. The AfD is running second, and its chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel, met Mr. Vance on Friday in Munich.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Parts of the AfD have been classified as extremist by German intelligence. Some of its members have been convicted of violating German law against the use of Nazi slogans. Others have been arrested for trying to overthrow the federal government. So although AfD candidates have been able to win parliamentary seats, no other party has been willing to form a coalition with them to take control of the government.</p><p>That collective shunning of the AfD and other extremist parties is known as the firewall. Mr. Vance took aim at it on Friday, saying the AfD and other hard-right parties across Europe represented legitimate voter concerns about high levels of migration into European countries from the Middle East and elsewhere.</p><p>“There is no room for firewalls,” Mr. Vance said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Campaign posters for the Social Democratic Party, left, and Alternative for Germany party in Amelinghausen, Germany. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thilo Schmuelgen/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The vice president also called restrictions on free speech a greater threat to Europe than military aggression from Russia or China.</p><p>Mr. Scholz chided Mr. Vance for that focus in a question-and-answer session after his speech. He was asked by Zanny Minton Beddoes, the editor in chief of The Economist, if Mr. Vance had made any points in his speech worth reflecting on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“You mean all these very relevant discussions about Ukraine and security in Europe?” Mr. Scholz said, drawing laughter from the audience.</p><p>Then he addressed Mr. Vance’s critique of European speech restrictions directly.</p><p>“We should be very clear that free speech in Europe means that you are not attacking others in ways that are against legislation and laws we have in our country,” Mr. Scholz said. “And that’s the case. There is no difference between the digital world and the analog world to say it like this. And we have to be very clear that hate and all this, which is so bad for our societies, should be not the reality of public debate.”</p><p>Mr. Zelensky, in his remarks, focused on the question of European defense. He reiterated his position that the United States would be pivotal in securing any cease-fire in Ukraine but that it would need Europe to also step up. He pointed to what he said were intelligence warnings of Russian plans to conduct military exercises in Belarus next summer. He noted that Russia had invaded Ukraine after deploying troops to Belarus under the guise of exercises.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine speaking at the conference in Munich, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronald Wittek/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“Europe just needs to come together and start acting in a way that no one can say ‘No’ to Europe, boss it around, or treat it like a pushover,” Mr. Zelensky said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Trump has said he wants access to minerals in Ukraine worth half a trillion dollars in exchange for continued military support; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent opened talks on that issue in Kyiv earlier this week.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky, in a conversation with the CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour after his speech, said, “We are still talking” about that possible deal.</p><p>He also said that Ukraine needed to be at the table at any cease-fire talks, and that he asked to meet with Mr. Trump before any meeting that Mr. Trump has with President Vladimir V.
