So did Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez.</p><p>But now Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and the rest of the current Yankee roster will be allowed to grow “well-groomed beards” if they so choose, after the club on Friday announced a change to its longstanding grooming policy.</p><p>The all-clear for beards was announced by Hal Steinbrenner, the team’s managing general partner whose father started the beard ban — and vigorously enforced it for years.</p><p>“After great consideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward,” Steinbrenner <a href="https://www.mlb.com/press-release/press-release-alteration-of-yankees-facial-hair-policy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement on Friday</a>. “It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar comfort of our former policy.”</p><p>Since the 1970s, the Yankees have barred their players, as well as staff members, from having beards or long hair. George Steinbrenner, Hal Steinbrenner’s father and the owner at the time, believed that neater appearance would increase professionalism and discipline among his players. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I’m trying to instill a certain sense of order and discipline in the ball club, because I think discipline is important in an athlete,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/23/archives/steinbrenner-rule-on-hair-splits-yanks-steinbrenner-cuts-yankee.html" title="">he said in 1976</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><figcaption><span>Joba Chamberlain, top row, and Johnny Damon both had to shave their beards upon joining the Yankees from other teams. </span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While some other major North American sports teams have policies regarding dress or appearance, the Yankees’ beard policy was among the strictest, and certainly the most well-known. That notoriety was compounded by the Yankees’ history of success — they have won 27 World Series titles, 16 more than any other team — and the seeming arrogance it brought, at least as perceived by many of its rivals.</p><p>Hal Steinbrenner said in the statement that he had consulted with “a large number of former and current Yankees, spanning several eras,” before changing the policy.</p><p>The policy has occasionally rankled members of the team. In one of the most famous incidents, Don Mattingly, the team’s best player and captain in 1991, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/16/sports/baseball-mattingly-flap-hair-today-gone-tomorrow.html" title="">was pulled from the lineup</a> and fined because he declined to cut his hair.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“I’m overwhelmed by the pettiness of it,” Mattingly told reporters then. He relented soon afterward and got a trim.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21xp-yankees-cvjh/21xp-yankees-cvjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21xp-yankees-cvjh/21xp-yankees-cvjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/21xp-yankees-cvjh/21xp-yankees-cvjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Don Mattingly, wearing a Yankees uniform on the field.

Mattingly, who voiced his own character, walked away saying, “I still like him better than Steinbrenner.”</p><p>In recent years, there was growing speculation that the policy was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/style/yankees-beard-hair-policy.html" title="">hurting the Yankees’ chances of acquiring quality players</a>.</p><p>“You’d be surprised how much more attractive the Yankees would be if they got rid of that facial hair rule,” Cameron Maybin, a former Yankee, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/style/yankees-beard-hair-policy.html" title="">said</a> in 2023. “You wouldn’t believe how many quality players just think it’s a wack rule to have.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Yankee policy had formally stated: “All players, coaches and male executives are forbidden to display any facial hair other than mustaches (except for religious reasons), and scalp hair may not be grown below the collar.”</p><p>There was no immediate word on any changes to the policy on hair length.</p><p>Over the decades, the policy led to awkward conversations in which Yankee managers had to urge their often well-paid players to get a shave or a trim. Some disagreed with the rule, but George Steinbrenner’s word was law.</p><p>The policy also led to often-drastic transformations for bearded players who joined the Yankees from other teams. Among those who shaved away facial hair upon arrival to the Yankees were Gerrit Cole in 2019, Nick Swisher in 2009 and Johnny Damon in 2006. Many other players grew beards back as soon as they were traded away from the team.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gerrit Cole wore a beard with the Houston Astros.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David J.
