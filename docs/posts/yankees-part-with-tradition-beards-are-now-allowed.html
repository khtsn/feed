So did Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez.</p><p>But now Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and the rest of the current Yankee roster can grow “well-groomed beards” if they so choose, after the club announced a change to its longstanding grooming policy.</p><p>“After great consideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward,” the team’s managing general partner, Hal Steinbrenner, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/press-release/press-release-alteration-of-yankees-facial-hair-policy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement on Friday</a>. “It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar comfort of our former policy.”</p><p>Since the 1970s, the Yankees have barred their players from having beards or long hair. The policy was started by then-owner George Steinbrenner, Hal Steinbrenner’s father, who believed that neater appearance would increase professionalism and discipline among his players.</p><p>While some other teams in major North American sports have policies regarding dress or appearance, the Yankees’ beard policy was among the strictest, and certainly the most famous.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hal Steinbrenner said he had consulted with “a large number of former and current Yankees, spanning several eras” before changing the policy.</p><p>The policy has occasionally rankled members of the team. In one of the most remembered incidents, Don Mattingly, the team’s best player and captain in 1991, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/16/sports/baseball-mattingly-flap-hair-today-gone-tomorrow.html" title="">was pulled from the lineup</a> because he declined to cut his hair.</p><p>“I’m overwhelmed by the pettiness of it,” Mattingly told reporters then. He relented soon afterward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Don Mattingly, who was once pulled from the team’s lineup for his refusal to cut his hair, at Yankee Stadium in 1991.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Focus on Sport/Getty</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“You’d be surprised how much more attractive the Yankees would be if they got rid of that facial hair rule,” Cameron Maybin, a former Yankee, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/style/yankees-beard-hair-policy.html" title="">said</a> in 2023. </p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victor-mather">More about Victor Mather</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
