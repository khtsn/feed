It will also aim to collect data on whether the drug leads to changes in participants’ employment status and sick days from work, according to <a href="https://thehealthinnovationnetwork.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-plans-to-partner-with-industry-on-a-new-study-to-deepen-understanding-of-a-weight-loss-medication/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> from the Health Innovation Network, the innovation arm of the N.H.S.</p><p>The government said that up to 3,000 people could eventually take part in the study.</p><p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer, speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, said he believed the drugs could be “very important for our economy and for health,” adding that tirzepatide “will be very helpful to people who want to lose weight, need to lose weight, very important for the economy so people can get back into work.”</p><p>Wes Streeting, Britain’s health secretary, wrote <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/10/14/widening-waistbands-are-a-burden-on-britain/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an opinion piece in The Telegraph</a> that the country’s “widening waistbands are also placing significant burden on our health service,” noting that illnesses linked to obesity cost the country’s health service roughly $14 billion a year.</p><p>“The long-term benefits of these drugs could be monumental in our approach to tackling obesity,” Mr. Streeting wrote. “For many people, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/03/weight-loss-jabs-mounjaro-nhs-patients/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">these weight-loss jabs</a> will be life-changing, help them get back to work and ease the demands on our N.H.S.”</p><p>But he added that “there must remain a responsibility on us all to take healthy living more seriously,” and said that the country’s health service “can’t be expected to always pick up the tab.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Earlier this month, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a government agency that gives guidance to the N.H.S. on medication and treatment, announced that tirzepatide <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/news/articles/consultation-on-nhs-england-proposals-for-a-phased-launch-of-obesity-injection" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would soon be available free of charge to people</a> living with obesity and other weight-related health conditions. The agency said that nearly a quarter of a million people would be eligible to receive the injections under a three-year plan.
