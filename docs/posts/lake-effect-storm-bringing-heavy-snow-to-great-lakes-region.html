Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York declared a state of emergency in 11 counties.</p><p>The storm had already brought more than eight inches of snow to portions of Marquette County in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula by Friday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>Portions of Western New York, such as Mayville on the northern end of Chautauqua Lake about 22 miles north of Jamestown, had recorded 17 inches of snow by midafternoon on Friday, according to forecasters.</p><p>Watertown, N.Y., where less than an inch of snow had fallen on Friday afternoon, was forecast to <a href="https://x.com/JordanHallWX/status/1862568855161200815/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">get close to six feet of snow</a> over the next three days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We are so accustomed to this kind of storm,” <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/audio-rush-transcript-governor-hochul-announces-state-emergency-lake-effect-snowstorm-hits-new" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. Hochul said in an interview</a> with Spectrum News on Friday. “We don’t love it, but it is part of who we are as New Yorkers, especially western New York and the North Country.”</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/RyanMaue/status/1862607710367162677/photo/3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Weather Service in Buffalo said</a> the prolonged lake-effect snow “will bury some areas east of both Lakes Erie and Ontario.”</p><p>“There will be localized areas that will be paralyzed from the lake snow, with some interstates also being greatly impacted,” it added.</p><p>The snow closed a section of westbound Interstate 90 from Hamburg, N.Y., to the Pennsylvania line.</p><p>Officials with the New York State Thruway Authority said they were working to clear the traffic backups that had built up on the portion of the closed westbound lanes of Interstate 90.</p><p>They could not say how many drivers were stranded but said that the three-mile stretch from Ripley, N.Y., to the Pennsylvania border, was the most difficult area to clear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Late Friday night, Irina Miller, 38, was entering her 10th hour of being stuck on that stretch. She was traveling home to Columbus, Ohio, after celebrating Thanksgiving in Buffalo with her husband and 19-month-old daughter when traffic came to stop near the Pennsylvania border.</p><p>“We’ve kind of accepted that we are stranded and we don’t know what’s happening,” Ms. Miller said about 11:30 p.m. “We’re just thankful that we have about a half tank of gas.”</p><p>The Weather Service warned of extreme effects from the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/buf/winter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">storm</a> through Monday. The severity could make driving extremely dangerous or impossible in parts of those regions.</p><p>The authorities in Canada issued similar warnings on Friday in Ontario. Some areas of the province were expected to get more than three feet of snow by Sunday afternoon because of squalls off Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.</p><p>Hotel workers near Erie, Pa., said guests were canceling because they could not reach their destinations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Chris Smith, who works at a Homewood Suites in Erie, near the Interstate 90 closure, said his hotel was starting to fill up as drivers left the snow-covered highways.</p><p>Lake-effect storms occur when cold air moves across a large body of warmer water. They typically happen in late fall and early winter.</p><p>“The lakes started out at basically a record warm for late November,” said David Roth, a forecaster with the Weather Service.</p><p>“Even in areas that are used to it, this is their first real lake-effect of the season,” he added. “They’re going to feel this. This will be a ‘Welcome to winter’ for them.”</p><p>According to AAA, the automobile organization, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2024/11/nearly-80-million-americans-expected-to-travel-over-thanksgiving/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 80 million</a> people were expected to travel for Thanksgiving this year. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/thanksgiving-travel-chicago-new-york.html" title="">About three million people</a> in the United States were expected to travel by air on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Erie International Airport in Pennsylvania was closed on Friday afternoon, while MBS International in Saginaw County, Mich., and Akron-Canton Airport in Ohio were de-icing aircraft, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>The first lake-effect snowstorm of the season “tends to be pretty exceptional,” Mr. Roth said. “When this happens is usually October, or much earlier in November.”</p><p>Buffalo could receive up to six inches of snow through Sunday, when the Bills host the San Francisco 49ers at their stadium in nearby Orchard Park, N.Y.</p><p>While the snow was expected to pile up, an Arctic blast was moving across the Northern Plains and the Midwest on Friday, with the wind chill across parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota plunging to 15 degrees below zero.</p><p>The Weather Service <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NWSWPC/posts/pfbid02wjDt5ycWjb5i9pZiVtviPKn699hQyLsopqbqhjdQVh3T2SbQrKB1YpyTpFYYsZ56l" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that the cold would persist into next week, with the Northern Plains and parts of the Midwest experiencing their lowest temperatures since mid-February.</p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> and <!-- -->Qasim Nauman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
