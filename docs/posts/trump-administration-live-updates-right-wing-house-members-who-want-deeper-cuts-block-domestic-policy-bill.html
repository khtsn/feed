McElroy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. In that earlier ruling, she found that the government could not abruptly wipe out a pandemic-era funding stream that many state and local health departments relied upon. </p><div><p>In the opinion Judge McElroy issued on Friday, she wrote: “The health care funding terminations would constrain the States’ infectious disease research, thwart treatment efforts to those struggling with mental health and addiction, and impact the availability of vaccines to children, the elderly, and those living in rural communities. Not to mention that the terminations were effective immediately, ignoring the States’ reliance on the funds.” </p><p>The Department announced the cutoffs on March 24. A coalition of 23 states and the District of Columbia then sued to stop the sudden change, arguing that they had been given no time to prepare for budget shortfalls and could face devastating shortages in many critical treatment areas.</p><p>Judge McElroy on Friday directed federal health agencies to “take every step necessary to effectuate this order” while the case proceeds — namely, dispersing the funds, which had already been allocated by Congress for the purposes of the state programs. Notably, however, her order only applies to those jurisdictions involved in the lawsuit.</p><p>Judge McElroy’s rulings mean that funding will remain in place for that coalition of Democratic-led states, which together represent more than 185 million Americans, or a little over half of the United States population counted in the last census. </p><p>In defending the cuts, the Trump administration has argued that since the official end of the emergency over the coronavirus pandemic in 2023, the funding was no longer necessary. </p><p>The states behind the lawsuit countered that the funding was intended to address a variety of public health problems — some of them worsened by the onslaught of Covid-19 — and that, much like other federal funding streams the Trump administration has worked to cut off, the money was authorized by Congress and could not be lawfully cut off unilaterally by the health department.</p><p>Judge McElroy’s ruling noted that the funds helped address disease outbreaks beyond the coronavirus, including measles and avian flu; bolstered mental health and substance abuse services; and helped support clinics in underserved areas.<span>  </span></p><p>“Though Congress appropriated the funds during the pandemic,” she wrote, the funds “ did much more than address Covid-related public health concerns.” </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzExOTU3MGFhLWU1NTktNTEwZC1iZTkwLTkwNjU5ZTJlMDZhNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#homeland-security-immigration-reality-show" data-source-id="100000010173839"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz"><img alt="Hamed Aleaziz" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T16:36:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 12:36 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rob Worsoff, a television producer, pitched to the Department of Homeland Security a reality show that would have immigrants go through a series of challenges to get American citizenship.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Frederick M.

She said the department was still reviewing the idea, which she spoke about several weeks ago with a producer named Rob Worsoff.</p><div><p>“The pitch generally was a celebration of being an American and what a privilege it is to be able to be a citizen of the United States of America,” she said. “It’s important to revive civic duty.”</p><p>She said the agency was happy to review “out-of-the-box pitches,” particularly those that celebrate “what it means to be an American.”</p><p>The project was reported earlier by <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14713113/DHS-Secretary-Kristi-Noem-reality-TV-immigrants-compete-US-citizenship.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>Mr. Worsoff <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/dhs-is-considering-reality-show-where-immigrants-compete-for-citizenship-47de277c?mod=author_content_page_1_pos_1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Wall Street Journal</a> that the show was not intended to be punitive.</p><p>“This isn’t ‘The Hunger Games’ for immigrants,” Mr. Worsoff said, adding, “This is not, ‘Hey, if you lose, we are shipping you out on a boat out of the country.’”</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin said the pitch had not yet reached the level of Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. She said on social media on Thursday that the department “receives hundreds of television show pitches a year,” including for documentaries about border operations and white-collar investigations. “Each proposal undergoes a thorough vetting process prior to denial or approval,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “This pitch has not received approval or denial by staff.”</p><p>The department has worked with filmmakers in the past on programming.</p><p>In 2017, during the first Trump administration, the agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/trump-immigration-nation-netflix.html" title="">allowed documentary filmmakers</a> extensive access to operations conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for a program called “Immigration Nation.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMDM2MGM0OTMtZGZkOC01MjA4LWJlOWQtYTdiMjE0ODA2OTNi"><div id="0360c493-dfd8-5208-be9d-a7b21480693b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#0360c493-dfd8-5208-be9d-a7b21480693b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/catie-edmondson"><img alt="Catie Edmondson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbStandard-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T16:08:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 12:08 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Now that five conservative Republicans on the House Budget Committee have tanked their party’s push to get their tax and spending cuts legislation to the House floor, Republican leaders will have to scramble to find changes that can both placate the hardliners and the more centrist members of the conference.

Without the support of Republican hard-liners on the Budget Committee, the bill cannot advance. But any changes to win their backing could alienate the more moderate Republicans whose votes will also be needed to pass the measure on the House floor.</p><p>Five Republicans representatives — Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania — joined Democrats in voting to block the legislation. The vote was 16 to 21 on a motion to advance the bill.</p><p>“This bill falls profoundly short; it does not do what we say it does with respect to deficits,” Mr. Roy said ahead of the vote, explaining his opposition. “Deficits will go up in the first half of the 10-year budget window, and we all know it’s true, and we shouldn’t do that. We shouldn’t say that we’re doing something we’re not doing.”</p><p>After the vote failed, the committee’s chairman, Representative Jodey C. Arrington of Texas, told its members they could return home to their districts, a sign that G.O.P. leaders did not expect the standoff to be resolved quickly.</p><p>“Well, the noes have it,” Mr. Arrington said as the vote concluded. “I want to thank everybody for their time and patience, and godspeed and safe travels.”</p><p>Mr. Smucker, who changed his “yes” vote to a “no” vote at the last minute, said he did so for procedural, not substantive reasons. Because he voted against the bill, he will be able to ask to call the legislation back up for consideration once Republicans broker a deal.</p><p>The legislation the party is trying to push through would make Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay through 2028, fulfilling a campaign pledge. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and subsidies for clean energy would partly offset the roughly $3.8 trillion cost of those tax measures over 10 years, as well as increased spending on the military and immigration enforcement.</p><p>But the conservatives are demanding changes to the bill, arguing that their leaders did not go far enough to cut federal spending. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that calls for lower deficits, estimated that the bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. A number of House conservatives have said they do not want to vote for legislation unless it is deficit neutral.</p><p>The revolt on Friday means that House Republican leaders will now try to negotiate changes to placate the hard-liners on the committee without losing the support of more moderate, politically vulnerable members.</p><p>That is going to be extraordinarily difficult.</p><p>The changes the conservatives seek cut to the heart of concerns from their most centrist colleagues. Chief among the hardliners’ frustrations is that a measure imposing work requirements on childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities would not kick in until 2029.</p><p>“We’re telling a healthy body, a healthy American, that you’ve got four years to get a job,” Mr. Norman said.</p><p>They are also unhappy that the legislation does not immediately eliminate a slew of clean energy tax credits that were created by President Joseph R.

Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, have described the tax bill as helping everyday Americans, economists have found that its most generous and lasting benefits will go to the wealthy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As Representative Jason Smith commenced a marathon session this week to consider a sprawling and expensive Republican tax package, he took special care to emphasize his party’s commitment to “hard-working Americans.”</p><p>“Pro-growth tax policy will shift our economy toward one that serves them, not the wealthy and well-connected,” Mr. Smith, the Missouri lawmaker who leads the House’s top tax panel, proclaimed.</p><div><p>But the proposal he is trying to get to President Trump’s desk ultimately tells a more complicated story. The Republican tax plan may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, according to a wide range of tax experts, and some taxpayers may actually be left in worse financial shape if the bill becomes law.</p><p>The latest assessment arrived Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan scorekeeper closely watched on Capitol Hill. Economists found that many Americans who make less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026.</p><p>The Penn Wharton estimate sought to analyze the full scope of the Republican tax package, computing the effects of the tax cuts as well as the plan to pay for them by slashing federal spending on other programs, including Medicaid and food stamps. Combined, those policies could fall disproportionately on the poorest, including those near or below the poverty line, the economists found.</p><p>People making between about $51,000 and $17,000 could lose about $700 on average in after-tax income beginning in 2026, according to the analysis, when factoring in both wages and federal aid. That reduction would worsen over the next eight years. People reporting less than $17,000 in income would see a reduction closer to $1,000, on average, also increasing over time, a shortfall that underscores their reliance on federal benefits.</p><p>By contrast, the top 0.1 percent, including those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain on average more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026, the data show. These earners benefit more from a Republican measure because it cuts taxes on the wealthy and makes other favorable changes, including for businesses, which may improve the value of their investments.</p><p>Penn Wharton did not factor economic growth into its projections. In recent days, Republicans have vigorously rejected any assertion that their bill is better for the richest Americans, arguing that it would generate substantial economic returns and deliver new jobs and rising wages in the process.</p><p>The legislation would extend a set of tax cuts on individuals and businesses that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies passed in 2017. That extension would stave off the “largest tax hike in American history,” Mr. Smith, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said at a hearing Tuesday. His office declined to comment.</p><p>The discrepancy highlights both the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the sheer scope of the changes that House Republicans seek. Much of their tax agenda remains a work in progress, as party leaders continue to grapple with <a href="#republicans-domestic-policy-bill" title="">simmering divisions in their ranks</a> and growing demands for changes from their counterparts in the Senate.</p><p>The extent of those fissures became clear on Friday, after a g<a href="#house-republicans-policy-bil" title="">roup of conservative Republicans voted</a> to block their party’s tax package from heading to the House floor. They demanded additional spending cuts, sending the party’s leaders scrambling, even though Mr. Trump had called on lawmakers hours earlier to unite around the bill.</p><p>“We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party,” the president wrote on social media. “STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!”</p><p>At the core of the effort, Republicans are racing to preserve the policies they enacted for Mr. Trump in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. The sprawling law changed the way taxpayers calculate their annual bills while lowering the corporate rate to 21 percent and the tax rate on the highest-earning individuals to 37 percent.</p><p>Republicans consider the law a resounding success. In a report issued in April, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the 2017 tax cuts increased the nation’s total economic output, which was 2.5 percent higher at the end of 2019 compared with the period before the law was enacted, while growing real wages by nearly $5,000.</p><p>“It helped set us up for a better economic situation going into the pandemic,” said Matthew D. Dickerson, the director of budget policy at the conservative-leaning Economic Policy Innovation Center.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump’s agenda may offer only modest gains to workers, some of whom may actually be left in worse financial shape if the House Republicans’ bill were to become law.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L. Cross for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But economists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/business/economy/trump-tax-cuts-effects.html" title="">long have warred over the law’s impact</a>, including its effects on the federal debt and its consequences for workers. Reviewing its economic and fiscal effects last year, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, found that an extension would again cut taxes for most Americans, but nearly <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/feature/reassessing-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half of its benefits</a> would flow to those who make <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/those-making-450000-and-would-get-nearly-half-benefit-extending-tcja" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$450,000 a year or more.</a></p><p>“Delivering tax relief that way, it’s sort of unavoidable to not have most of the benefits go to higher-income people,” said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.</p><p>In reprising that approach, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies unveiled a <a href="#house-gop-tax-bill-trump" title="">bevy of additions</a> they have described as a boon for everyday workers. For individual taxpayers, they proposed to raise the standard deduction by $1,000, while aiming to lift it by $4,000 for seniors, in a move meant to replace the president’s promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security.</p><p>House Republican lawmakers also proposed adding $500 to the child tax credit, which families can receive through their tax filings annually, and they looked to end federal taxes on tips and overtime pay, as requested by Mr. Trump.</p><p>Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said in an interview this week on CNBC that the president had instructed Congress to “go after the things that are going to help middle-class folks.”</p><p>The sum of those proposals could help reduce many workers’ tax bills, according to early analyses. One report this week from the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/big-beautiful-bill-house-gop-tax-plan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tax Foundation</a>, a research center that generally favors lower taxes, found that the legislation would increase market incomes — a measure of income that includes wages and other elements — by 4.4 percent on average in 2026.</p><p>But Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the organization, said the benefits would not be parceled out equally, resulting in the “larger increases in after-tax income for the top 5 percent of taxpayers.”</p><p>Asked about the early findings, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that the president’s “‘one big, beautiful bill’ will continue to prove the haters wrong.”</p><p>Mr. Fields also pointed to the <a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications/2025/jcx-23-25/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">findings of the Joint Committee on Taxation</a>, a nonpartisan budget keeper on Capitol Hill. Its report, issued Tuesday, showed most Americans would see a tax cut under the House measure, though some lower-income taxpayers could see increases. That may be because some of Republicans’ proposed tax cuts targeting workers are temporary and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-temporary.html" title="">would expire within the next 10 years</a>.</p><p>But the tax scorekeepers only captured some of the effects of Republicans’ agenda. In the House, party leaders have moved to offset their proposal with an expansive set of cuts to a wide variety of federal agencies, programs and tax credits, some of which serve those with lower incomes.</p><p>House Republicans chose, for example, to tighten eligibility for tax credits that help millions of Americans purchase health insurance. Party leaders also proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">deep reductions in Medicaid</a>, which offers coverage to the poor, and food stamps.</p><p>Under each of those changes, millions of Americans stand to lose access to federal safety net benefits, according to the government’s own estimates in recent months. Those losses threaten to overshadow any gains among some of those families from the president’s campaign to slash taxes, some data show.</p><p>“It is dishonest to pretend the tax analysis is a full representation of the bill,” said Brendan Duke, the senior director for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group.</p><p>In his own <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/how-house-republican-agenda-boosts-the-wealthy-does-little-or-worse-for-low-income-families" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">number crunching</a>, Mr. Duke found that the after-tax income of people making over $1 million would rise by 4.3 percent in 2027, translating to an average gain of more than $89,000. His analysis incorporated a Republican plan to relax the estate tax, which benefits higher earners.</p><p>But Mr. Duke found that the bottom fifth of all American earners would see only a 0.6 improvement in their after-tax income, which on average equals about $90. His analysis did not include the effects of spending cuts in programs like Medicaid.</p><p>The savings nonetheless help to offset a package that introduces a series of permanent tax changes that carry great benefits for the wealthy.</p><p>House Republicans have proposed a higher threshold for triggering the estate tax, which eases the financial burden on wealthier Americans who pass down large inheritances, along with a 23 percent deduction for so-called pass-through income, which reduces taxes on business income taxed at the individual rates of an owner.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/trump-new-tax-bracket.html" title="">did call for raising taxes on the wealthy</a>, particularly by creating a new tax bracket for people making more than $2.5 million a year.

Earlier this week, he visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar on the first major international visit of his second term.</p><div><p>Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump’s trip:</p><h2 id="link-5839315c">He broke the diplomatic ice with Syria.</h2><p>Mr. Trump spoke with Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Shara, on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-syria-al-shara-sanctions.html" title="">an extraordinary meeting</a> that reversed longstanding U.S. policies toward the country and Mr. al-Shara. A former militant who once led a branch of Al Qaeda, Mr. al-Shara came to power as the head of the rebel alliance that ousted the former dictator Bashar al-Assad in December.</p><p>A day earlier, Mr. Trump had announced that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, which would offer a significant economic lifeline to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/middleeast/syria-president-al-shara-interview.html" title="">Mr. al-Shara</a> as he tries to rebuild a country devastated by years of civil war. His unexpected announcement drew enthusiastic applause from a crowd of dignitaries in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><h2 id="link-6757f14e">Big deals were announced, but details were lacking.</h2><p>The White House has said Mr. Trump’s visit resulted in deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/qatar-airways-boeing-jets.html" title="">a large order from Qatar</a> for Boeing passenger jets.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/trump-deals-middle-east-saudi-arabia-qatar-uae.html" title="">details have been sparse</a> and some of the agreements had already been in the works. In the case of the Boeing deal, Mr. Trump boasted that it was worth $200 billion, but a fact sheet from the White House said the true number was $96 billion.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump with the Emirati president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, at the presidential palace in Abu Dhabi, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Trump said that the total investments from the three nations he visited could reach as high as $4 trillion. While much of that total comes in the form of long-term pledges that may or may not materialize — and counts some deals that were already underway — leaders of the Gulf nations were all too happy to supply Mr. Trump with the eye-popping figures.</p><h2 id="link-5dc2611b">Trump pointed to progress in Iran talks.</h2><p>Mr. Trump brought up nuclear negotiations with Iran on several occasions. On Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump said he was offering Tehran “a much better path toward a far better and more hopeful future,” while insisting the United States would not allow Tehran to develop a nuclear weapon.</p><p>And after a senior Iranian official spoke in an interview with NBC News about the prospect of “better relations” with the United States, Mr. Trump shared the comments on his social media page on Thursday. That was seen by Iranian commentators as a sign that he was willing to abandon the maximalist position of shutting down Iran’s nuclear program.</p><p>On his trip, Mr. Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-middle-east-syria-qatar-saudi-arabia-8bd63b3f9fc1856532a00adf1795e38f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked for help</a> from Qatar, which has played the role of intermediary between the United States and Iran, in reaching an agreement. In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Trump also heaped praise on Qatar and said that Iran was “very lucky” to have such an ally.</p><h2 id="link-426732b">He made an unusual reference to suffering in Gaza.</h2><p>Mr. Trump did not visit America’s biggest regional ally, Israel, and largely sidestepped the conflict in Gaza even as Israeli strikes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza.html" title="">killed dozens</a> of Palestinians across the territory over the past week.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians leaving their homes in Beit Lahia, in Gaza on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But on Friday, he said he wanted to see the conflict resolved and made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/trump-gaza-starvation-famine-us-israel-aid.html" title="">a rare acknowledgment</a> of the civilian suffering in Gaza. “There’s a lot of people starving, a lot of bad things going on,” he said. Mr. Trump has remained largely silent on Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-starvation-israel.html" title="">as the civilian toll mounts</a>. After his turnaround on Syria, Gulf Arab leaders who met with Mr. Trump seized on the opportunity to address that stance. His seemingly more sympathetic tone on Gaza was a notable shift given his longstanding close relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p><h2 id="link-3ef661c0">Russia-Ukraine talks loomed in the background, but Trump stayed away.</h2><p>Mr. Trump kept people guessing over whether he would extend his trip by traveling to Turkey, where cease-fire talks involving Russia and Ukraine were going on. Ultimately he decided not to go.</p><p>Russian and Ukrainian officials were in Istanbul for talks, along with top Trump administration officials, but President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was not attending and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">expectations for a breakthrough were low</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump himself lowered expectations in comments on Thursday, saying nothing meaningful would happen until he met personally with Mr. Putin. On Friday, Mr. Trump said he might call the Russian leader and would meet him “as soon as we can set it up.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Y1NGE4MjRiLWVkZTEtNTFmYy1hM2MyLThjMmFlYWNjMjY3Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#doj-trump-deportation-abrego-garcia" data-source-id="100000010168813"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-feuer"><img alt="Alan Feuer" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T09:02:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 5:02 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The federal courthouse in Greenbelt, Md.

In fact, in a declaration filed last week mostly under seal, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the disclosure of such material “could be expected to cause significant harm to the foreign relations and national security interests of the United States.”</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Abrego Garcia have scoffed at the idea that the government’s efforts to free their client from El Salvador should be considered a state secret, especially given that Mr. Trump and some of his top aides have been talking publicly about the man for weeks.</p><p>“On its face, there is little reason to believe that compliance with a court order to facilitate the release and return of a single mistakenly removed individual so that he can get his day in court implicates state secrets at all,” the lawyers wrote in a court filing this week. “No military or intelligence operations are involved, and it defies reason to imagine that the United States’ relationship with El Salvador would be endangered by any effort to seek the return of a wrongfully deported person who the government admits never should have been removed to El Salvador in the first place.”</p><p>Judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the proceeding, will hear both sides of this debate on Friday and eventually determine whether to let the government use what is known as the state secrets privilege and other legal protections to keep its internal deliberations under wraps. The hearing in front of her could become contentious, if only because the administration has for weeks been stonewalling her efforts to get to the bottom of how it has been handling the Abrego Garcia case.</p><p>In early April, for example, the judge determined that the White House had failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s instructions to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from Salvadoran custody. As an initial remedy, she ordered the government to provide her with daily updates about what steps it had taken and planned to take to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia’s freedom.</p><p>Then, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/appeals-court-white-house-deportee.html" title="">a federal appeals court directed officials to take a more proactive role</a> in getting him out of custody, Judge Xinis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/trump-abrego-garcia-deported-hearing.html" title="">opened an investigation into what exactly the administration had been doing.</a> As part of that inquiry, she ordered Trump officials to answer questions — both in person and in writing — about the deal they had reached to house deported immigrants in El Salvador and what had been done to free Mr. Abrego Garcia from the notorious mega-prison there known as CECOT.</p><p>But that process also broke down and Judge Xinis quickly blasted the government for what she called its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/trump-justice-department-abrego-garcia-el-salvador.html" title="">“willful and bad faith refusal”</a> to adequately answer the questions. Just as she appeared to be losing patience, the Justice Department asked her for a pause in the question-asking process, suggesting there had been a diplomatic development that justified a seven-day delay.</p><p>The New York Times reported that around that time, officials at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-abrego-garcia-bukele-el-salvador.html" title="">the State Department had sent a note to their counterparts in El Salvador</a> inquiring about having Mr. Abrego Garcia released, but El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, rejected the offer.</p><p>In the end, Judge Xinis granted the Justice Department’s request for a delay, but denied department lawyers when they asked her for a second weeklong pause. Last week, finally faced with having to answer questions about the case, department lawyers countered with their latest legal maneuver: an invocation of the state secrets privilege.</p><p>It was not the first time that the administration tried the same tactic in a deportation case.</p><p>In late March, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/judge-ruling-trump-deportations-alien-enemies-act.html" title="">invoked the state secrets privilege in an effort to avoid providing data to a federal judge in Washington</a> about three charter planes that flew to El Salvador that month carrying Mr. Abrego Garcia and scores of other immigrants.</p><p>The judge in that case, James E. Boasberg, wanted the data in an effort to determine whether the government had flouted his order to turn the planes around. Judge Boasberg’s investigation into the White House’s compliance with his ruling was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/court-contempt-trump-deportations.html" title="">temporarily put on hold last month by the federal appeals court</a> that sits over him.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdmZmI3MjgzLTE1OWEtNTE4MS05ZWM3LTIyY2ZmYjY5ZmQ0OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#james-comey-post-trump" data-source-id="100000010173331"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron"><img alt="Chris Cameron" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T03:33:34.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 15, 2025, 11:33 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, in Washington in 2020.

Weeks before the 2020 election, Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/10/19/8645-meaning-whitmer-trump/3708927001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seized on a pin that said “86 45”</a> that could be seen on a table behind Gov.

Puskar/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Trump administration on Thursday fired nearly 600 employees at Voice of America, a federally funded news network that provides independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms.</p><p>The layoffs targeted contractors, most of them journalists but also some administrative employees, and amounted to over a third of Voice of America’s staff. They signaled that the Trump administration planned to continue its efforts to dismantle the broadcaster despite a court ruling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/judge-trump-voice-of-america.html" title="">last month</a> that ordered the federal government to maintain robust news programming at the network, which President Trump has called “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/the-voice-of-radical-america/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the voice of radical America</a>.”</p><div><p>In another sign of the Trump administration’s hostility toward the broadcaster, the federal building in Washington that houses the media organization was <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/real-estate/real-estate-services/real-property-disposition/assets-identified-for-accelerated-disposition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put up for sale on Thursday</a>.</p><p>Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, said in an email to his staff on Thursday that the firings were “inexplicable.”</p><p>“I am heartbroken,” he said. Mr. Abramowitz has sued to stop the Trump administration from closing the news organization.</p><p>Kari Lake, a senior adviser at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America, said that the Trump administration had acted within its legal authority.</p><p>“We are in the process of rightsizing the agency and reducing the federal bureaucracy to meet administration priorities,” Ms. Lake, who is leading the efforts to ramp down the operations of Voice of America, said in a statement. “We will continue to scale back the bloat at U.S.A.G.M. and make an archaic dinosaur into something worthy of being funded by hardworking Americans.”</p><p>She added: “Buckle up. There’s more to come.”</p><p>Some of the journalists who were terminated on Thursday were from countries with repressive governments that persecute journalists for independent reporting, Mr. Abramowitz said in the email to employees on Thursday.</p><p>Those journalists now have to leave the United States by the end of June, as their immigration status is tied to employment at the news organization.</p><p>In a letter sent on Thursday to employees who had been fired, the Trump administration cited “<a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/8.406-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the government’s convenience</a>” as a reason for the terminations. The employees were under so-called <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/37.104" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personal services contracts</a>, making them easier to let go than regular full-time employees with full civil service protections.</p><p>Mr. Trump has accused the outlet, which delivers news to countries with repressive regimes — including Russia, China and Iran — of spreading “anti-American” and partisan “propaganda.”</p><p>In March, Ms. Lake, a Trump ally and unsuccessful candidate for governor and Senate in Arizona, had declared her own workplace “<a href="https://x.com/KariLake/status/1902532400183206000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unsalvageable</a>.” She has also claimed that the U.S. Agency for Global Media and its newsrooms were rampant with “waste, fraud and abuse,” without providing evidence.</p><p>Ms. Lake said last week that Voice of America would incorporate content from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/trump-voice-of-america.html" title="">One America News Network</a>, a pro-Trump television channel that has endorsed falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Voice of America, which was founded in 1942, halted operations on March 15, a day after Mr. Trump signed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/trump-order-voice-of-america.html" title="">an executive order</a> seeking to gut the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Its news programming has been partly restored since the April court ruling that stopped the Trump administration from dismantling the agency and other newsrooms it oversees. </p><p>The Trump administration has challenged the April ruling, claiming that the lower court had gone too far in halting other firings that took place in March.</p><p>In early May, a federal appeals court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/us/politics/voice-of-america-reporters-trump.html" title="">paused parts of the April lower court order</a> that required the Trump administration to rehire the employees.</p><p>The Trump administration did not appeal parts of the April order that mandated the resumption of Voice of America’s news programming. The lower court found that Congress had required the executive branch to keep the network as “a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.”</p><p>The Trump administration has since kept most of Voice of America’s operations shuttered while restoring parts of its service. Its Mandarin and Persian services, for example, were restored. But the news organization’s English website has stopped updating <a href="https://www.voanews.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">since March 15</a>.</p><p>Lydia DePillis<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2ZhZmJjOTNmLTI1Y2YtNTFmZC1iM2M5LWRjOWQ2ZmFhYTg1Nw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#house-gop-tax-bill-trump" data-source-id="100000010169046"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-15T20:07:50.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 15, 2025, 4:07 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The bill includes about $175 billion in new spending to enforce President Trump’s ambitious anti-immigration agenda.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Republicans’ megabill to enact President Trump’s agenda began coming together this week, as a trio of committees released, debated and approved critical pieces of legislation that House leaders hope to bring to a vote as soon as next week.</p><p>It would slash taxes, while providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement, while cutting health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to pay for it.</p><div><p>Major portions of the sprawling package remain unresolved, amid Republican divisions over cuts to Medicaid and details of the tax plan, among other issues. But the emerging package provides a newly detailed picture of the party’s policy priorities, as well as a road map of the sticking points that could derail what Mr. Trump calls the “big, beautiful bill.”</p><p>Republicans are pushing the package through Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/15/us/politics/trump-budget-reconciliation-process.html" title="">using a special process known as budget reconciliation</a> that allows them to steer around a filibuster and win approval without a single Democratic vote. But with tiny majorities in both chambers, they can afford to lose no more than three Republican votes in both the House and Senate. The first test will come in the House, where leaders want to bring it up before Memorial Day.</p><p>Here’s a look at the bill, and the biggest remaining areas of disagreement within the party:</p><h3 id="link-6942c54"><span>Cutting taxes</span></h3><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The heart of the bill is a roughly $3.8 trillion tax cut that would lock in many of the tax cuts Republicans passed in 2017, including lower marginal income rates, a larger standard deduction and a higher threshold for the estate tax, with some tweaks.</p><p>The measure also includes several new, temporary tax cuts that Mr. Trump campaigned on, including his promises not to tax tips or overtime. His pitch not to tax Social Security benefits takes the form of a bonus $4,000 deduction available to Americans over 65, with the benefit shrinking at higher income levels. Americans would also be able to deduct interest on car loans from their taxable income, though the car has to be made in the United States.</p><p>The reductions would last only through 2028, as would a $1,000 addition to the standard deduction and a $500 bonus to the child tax credit, which now maxes out at $2,000. Children born over the next four years would receive $1,000 deposited in a so-called “MAGA account” that is invested in the stock market.</p><p>Businesses would receive several tax cuts, including valuable deductions for research and investment spending, as well as a new tax break for building factories. A deduction available to the owners of many businesses would become slightly more generous and be extended indefinitely.</p><p>The bill also includes tax hikes on universities, noncitizens and some families with children. A tax on the investment income that university endowments earn would rise substantially, from 1.4 percent to as high as 21 percent. Immigrants authorized to live in the United States — but who are not citizens or green card holders — would be barred from receiving tax credits covering the cost of health insurance premiums. And tighter eligibility rules for the child tax credit would take the benefit away from roughly two million children.</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> The biggest problem for the tax plan, for now, is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/nyregion/salt-tax-deduction.html" title="">state and local tax deduction</a>. The bill would triple the current $10,000 limit on the cap to $30,000. But a group of holdout Republicans from high-tax states like New York have demanded an even higher increase to the cap, a challenging prospect for Republican leaders who also need the support of conservatives who hate the expensive tax break.</p><h3 id="link-354e64d1"><span>Scaling back Medicaid</span></h3><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The bill makes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">major changes to reduce the cost of the health insurance program for the poor</a> and disabled. The centerpiece of those efforts is a strict work requirement for childless adults without disabilities, which would require beneficiaries to document 80 hours of monthly work, or prove they qualified for an exception, or else risk losing their benefits. Those new rules would not kick in until 2029, after the next presidential election.</p><p>More immediately, the legislation would make it easier for states to cancel people’s coverage by allowing them to increase paperwork requirements and drop those who don’t respond to requests to verify their income or residency. It also would require states to impose co-payments for a wide array of medical services for adults on Medicaid who live above the poverty line, a policy some Democrats described as a “sick tax.”</p><p>Another provision would reduce Medicaid funding to states that use their own tax revenues to provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants, a change that could affect financing for 12 mostly Democrat-controlled states. The legislation would bar Medicaid from providing funding to Planned Parenthood as long as the organization continued to provide abortions. And the bill would limit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/upshot/medicaid-hospitals-republicans-cuts.html" title="">strategies that states have developed</a> to tax medical providers and pay them higher prices for Medicaid services.</p><p>Taken together with policies that would affect private Obamacare coverage, the <a href="https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/cbo-emails-re-e%26c-reconcilation-scores-may-11%2C-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Congressional Budget Office estimated</a> that the legislation would cause 8.6 million more Americans to be uninsured at the end of a decade, while reducing federal spending on health care by more than $700 billion. That estimate may be updated in the coming weeks as the office continues to analyze the bill.</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> Democrats have made the Medicaid changes the main focus of their critique of the bill, arguing that Republicans are slashing health coverage for poor Americans to finance tax cuts for the rich. In an effort to insulate their most vulnerable incumbents from backlash, G.O.P. leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">omitted overhaul proposals</a> that would have permanently changed the structure of the program. But one populist Republican, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, has called the cuts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/14/us/trump-news-middle-east#senator-josh-hawley-a-missouri-republican-opposes-the-house-gop-plan-for-medicaid-cuts" title="">a nonstarter</a>, saying they amount to “taxing the poor to give to the rich.” And some conservative lawmakers in the House who wanted much larger reductions are disappointed with the scale of the changes and the delayed implementation of the work requirement.</p><h3 id="link-7cb0e994"><span>Ending clean energy programs</span></h3><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The bill would sharply curtail most of the big tax credits for clean energy contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Many of those incentives were expected to last a decade and have so far led businesses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/climate/ira-repubican-tax-bill-clean-energy.html" title="">to announce more than $841 billion in investments</a>, from wind farms in Wyoming to battery factories in Georgia.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tax credits for low-emissions electricity sources like wind would be available in full only to power plants in service before the end of 2028.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Among the major changes: A $7,500 tax break for buyers of electric cars <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/republican-budget-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html" title="">would largely phase out</a> by the end of 2025, with a one-year extension for automakers that have not sold many models yet. Tax credits for low-emissions electricity sources like wind, solar, nuclear and geothermal power would be available in full only to power plants in service before the end of 2028, and then would zero out within three years. A credit for making hydrogen fuels would end this year.</p><p>The bill would also impose new “foreign entity of concern” restrictions on tax breaks for both power plants and factories that build solar panels, batteries or other low-carbon technologies by disqualifying companies that use components from China. That’s a steep hurdle, since China dominates global supply chains. The bill would also end by 2028 a practice that allowed smaller firms with little tax liability to claim the credits and sell them for cash, making the incentives more widely accessible.</p><p>Not all energy sources were affected. A tax credit for biofuels, which is popular in farm states, received a four-year extension in the bill. And a credit for capturing carbon dioxide from polluting facilities and burying it underground, which is backed by oil and gas companies, was mostly kept intact.</p><p>Other portions of the bill would expedite federal approvals for oil and gas projects in exchange for up to $10 million in fees, scrap Biden-era rules on tailpipe pollution from cars and trucks and repeal an E.P.A. program aimed at curbing methane leaks from oil and gas operations. The legislation also pulls back unspent funds from the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, which has nearly $400 billion in lending authority for emerging technologies.</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> Slashing the energy credits has been contentious even among Republicans, since more than three-quarters of the investments driven by the Inflation Reduction Act have occurred in red districts. At least three dozen Republicans in the House and four in the Senate have spoken out in favor of preserving at least some of the incentives, such as for nuclear power or domestic manufacturing, to protect jobs and bolster U.S. energy security.</p><h3 id="link-380179fa"><span>Slashing food stamps</span></h3><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> In a bid to save money and restrict benefits, the bill would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-taxes-snap-program.html" title="">make a series of changes</a> to scale back the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides monthly aid known as food stamps to about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=109895" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">42 million low-income people</a>.</p><p>Under the proposal, food stamp recipients between the ages of 18 and 64 would have to obtain work in order to receive federal aid. That mandate would also apply to parents with children 7 and older. Current law subjects only beneficiaries up to age 54 to work requirements, and carves out parents with dependents.</p><p>Additionally, the bill would force states to shoulder some of the costs of SNAP, which historically has been funded by the federal government. It would limit the ability of future administrations to raise food stamp benefit amounts. And SNAP would be restricted to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.</p><p>By Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had not released an analysis about the full effects of these and other changes. Past reports about <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-09/hr1581_letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar proposals</a> have found that strict work requirements could result in millions of food stamp recipients losing access to benefits.</p><p>The changes to SNAP would also have indirect effects on school nutrition programs. Many children automatically qualify for free lunches because their families are eligible for SNAP. Poor children whose parents lose SNAP coverage under the legislation would have to individually apply. Reductions in SNAP enrollment would also affect which public schools qualify for universal free lunch programs, which rely on the share of neighborhood families with nutrition benefits</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> Some Republicans from districts with high concentrations of food stamp recipients have balked in the past at cuts to the program, and insisted on allowing states to relax work requirements, which the bill would limit their ability to do. But so far, there has been no outcry in the G.O.P. against the SNAP cuts.</p><h3 id="link-5d0fec26"><span>Boosting national security and immigration enforcement</span></h3><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The plan would devote an additional $150 billion in military spending, to help boost shipbuilding efforts, and to build a new space-based missile defense system Mr. Trump has proposed that the military is calling <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4127682/dods-acquisition-community-already-working-on-golden-dome-big-team-effort-requi/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Dome</a>.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Military troops listening to Mr. Trump speak in Qatar on Thursday. The bill would include $150 billion in additional military spending.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>It also includes about $175 billion in new spending to enforce Mr. Trump’s ambitious anti-immigration agenda, including for bulking up the barriers at the nation’s southern border and for additional Border Patrol agents and facilities. Those measures are considered the least controversial in the legislative package and are meant to entice Republicans to vote for it.</p><h3 id="link-48924c56"><span>Cutting education programs</span></h3><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The bill would slice $330 billion out of student loan spending over a decade. The biggest change would eliminate for new borrowers the Biden-era student loan repayment program known as SAVE — which ties loan payments to income and household size — as well as the Pay As You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan.</p><p>It would replace those with a single repayment plan that would be more costly for many students.</p><p>Total federal loan amounts would be capped by year and by program for graduate student loans, and new limits would be placed on how much parents can borrow to pay for their children’s tuition.</p><p>The bill also would make it more difficult for part-time students to obtain Pell Grants, increasing the number of credits per semester required for the maximum award from 12 to 15, and requiring them to be enrolled at least half of the time to qualify at all. But it would allow Pell Grants to be used for shorter-term programs that earn students professional certifications.</p><h3 id="link-63154630"><span>Raising the debt ceiling</span></h3><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The legislation would increase the nation’s statutory debt limit by $4 trillion. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this month that the United States could run out of money to pay its bills by August if Congress does not raise or suspend the nation’s debt limit.</p><p>Many ultraconservative Republicans have long prided themselves on refusing to back any increase to the nation’s borrowing cap, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/us/politics/gop-spending-hawks-trump-debt.html" title="">refused to do so in December</a> even at Mr. Trump’s urging. But some have conceded they would rather raise the debt limit through the reconciliation bill — which allows them to pass legislation without a single Democratic vote — to deprive the minority party of any negotiating leverage.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRhZjc5ZjRjLWQ0YTEtNTRhYy1hMDYzLTlkYzBhNmI0YmEwZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#republicans-domestic-policy-bill" data-source-id="100000010171759"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-15T17:48:13.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 15, 2025, 1:48 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, at the Capitol on Wednesday. An influential anti-spending conservative, Mr. Roy declared that he planned to vote against approving the tax and budget legislation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Conservative Republicans in the House were in open revolt on Thursday over their party’s major legislation to deliver President Trump’s domestic agenda, threatening to derail the tax and budget measure over concerns that it would add too much to the deficit.</p><p>In the latest indication of the dissent in the G.O.P.’s ranks, two Republicans, Representatives Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, told reporters they planned to vote against approving the legislation in the Budget Committee in a session planned for Friday.</p><div><p>Mr. Roy and Mr. Norman’s opposition alone would be enough to block the measure from reaching the floor, upending the party’s drive to push the legislation through the House before a Memorial Day recess. A number of other conservative, anti-spending Republicans sit on the panel, and suggested they could follow suit.</p><p>“Right now, the House proposal fails to meet the moment,” Mr. Roy said. “It does not meaningfully change spending. Plus, many of the decent provisions and cuts don’t begin until 2029 and beyond. That is swamp accounting to dodge real savings.”</p><p>As the day began on Thursday, Mr. Roy was alone in declaring his intention to tank the bill in committee — a declaration that came roughly half an hour after the Texas Republican entered a meeting in Speaker Mike Johnson’s office meant to assuage holdout lawmakers.</p><p>But by the afternoon, a growing number of Republicans on the panel were venting their frustrations with the measure, and it appeared that House G.O.P. leaders lacked the support, for now, to push the legislation carrying Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda over its next hurdle.</p><p>“It’s clear we don’t know the true cost of this bill or whether it adheres to the Budget blueprint,” Representative Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma wrote on social media. “We have a duty to know the true cost of this legislation before advancing it. If we are to operate in truth, we must have true numbers — even if that means taking some more time to obtain that truth.”</p><p>Another, Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, declined to say how he planned to vote in committee, but said the legislation “doesn’t seem that sincere” in its efforts to cut spending.</p><p>The bill would extend Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cut and temporarily enact his campaign pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and subsidies for clean energy would partly offset the roughly $3.8 trillion cost of those tax measures, as well as increased spending on the military and immigration enforcement.</p><p>Republicans like Mr. Roy are demanding changes to the bill, arguing that their leaders did not go far enough to cut federal spending. Some had earlier insisted that the final product add nothing to the deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that calls for lower deficits, estimated that the bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p><p>They are also unhappy that a number of the provisions in the legislation to cut spending — chief among them a measure imposing work requirements on childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities — would not kick in until 2029.</p><p>“On Medicaid work requirements: Start ‘em now,” Representative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania wrote on social media. “The American People are sick of half measures. Some of my congressional colleagues want to do anything but LEGISLATE…”</p><p>G.O.P. leaders had toiled to structure the legislation to protect their most politically vulnerable members from accusations that the party was moving to gut popular health care programs like Medicaid. They <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">stopped short of a structural overhaul</a> that would have made deep cuts to the program.</p><p>House Republican leaders were discussing rewriting the work requirements so they would take effect sooner in a bid to appease conservatives. But it is a treacherous balancing act for Mr. Johnson, who must try to satisfy both his most conservative members agitating for significant spending cuts, and his swing-seat members who say voting for legislation taking an ax to widely used federal programs would send them to an early political retirement.</p><p>He was sanguine emerging from the meeting in his office on Thursday.</p><p>“Not everybody’s going to be delighted with every provision in a bill this large, but everyone can be satisfied, and we’re very, very close to that,” Mr. Johnson told reporters.</p><p>But conservatives like Mr. Roy are not the only Republicans who have concerns about the legislation.</p><p>A small group of Republicans from New York and California are threatening to torpedo the bill over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/republicans-salt-cap.html" title="">the state and local tax deduction</a>. Others have called on Republican leaders to kill some of the most aggressive provisions in the legislation roll eliminating clean energy tax credits.</p><p>And even if the House can clear the legislation, a number of Republican senators have been unsparing in their criticism of the bill and suggested they would want to impose significant changes.</p><p>But first, the legislation must clear the Budget Committee.</p><p>The panel’s role is mainly procedural but significant for complying with the special reconciliation rules that protect the legislation from a filibuster in the Senate. The committee is responsible for merging the legislative proposals produced by 11 committees who have written various pieces of the reconciliation package into a single bill and sending it to the House floor through the Rules Committee.</p><p>Members of the Budget Committee don’t have the power to make any changes to the legislation at this point, but they must approve it to allow the bill to move forward.</p><p>With Democrats unanimously opposed, Republicans on the panel need near unanimity to make that happen.</p><p>Any attempt to skirt the committee could lead to trouble in the Senate even if the House were to approve the bill. The reconciliation rules require that the measure be a product of the Budget Committee for it to qualify for a majority-only vote. Working around the Budget Committee could violate that rule and allow Democrats to filibuster the legislation, effectively killing it.</p><p>Carl Hulse<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
