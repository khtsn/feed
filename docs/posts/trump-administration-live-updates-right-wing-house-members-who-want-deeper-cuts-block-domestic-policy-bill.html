The packages include Chinook helicopters, armed drones, hundreds of bombs, targeting kits, F-16 aircraft components and other military equipment.</p><div><p>The State Department approved the proposed sales and formally notified Congress shortly before Mr. Trump’s trip. However, for the sale to the Emirates, the administration bypassed an informal review period that allows senior lawmakers on foreign affairs committees to raise concerns or negotiate changes before full congressional notification.</p><p>Leading the opposition is Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, who on Thursday introduced resolutions aimed at blocking the arms sales to both countries.</p><p>Mr. Murphy questioned the sale to Qatar in light of reports that the country had offered Mr. Trump a $400 million luxury Boeing jet as a gift.</p><p>“Unless Qatar rescinds their offer of a ‘palace in the sky’ or Trump turns it down, I will move to block this arms sale,” Mr. Murphy said in a statement. He also pointed to a $5.5 billion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/middleeast/trump-family-qatar-dubai.html" title="">real estate and golf course deal</a> involving the Trump family and a firm affiliated with Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. The project would involve a Trump-branded beachside golf course and luxury villa project in the country.</p><p>Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, all Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee, joined in supporting the resolutions, along with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.</p><p>The group also expressed concerns about the Emirates sale, saying it was improperly connected to recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-usd1-dubai-conference-announcement.html" title="">investment by a state-backed Emirati firm</a> into a cryptocurrency business linked to the Trump family.</p><p>Additionally, the lawmakers criticized the Emirates for its role in the war Sudan. U.S. and U.N. officials have accused the Emirates of supporting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/africa/sudan-rsf-zamzam.html" title="">Rapid Support Forces</a>, a Sudanese paramilitary group that the State Department, during the Biden administration, determined committed genocide in Sudan.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s State Department has not made the same determination, though officials have repeatedly condemned the group, including last month after an attack led to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/africa/sudan-rsf-zamzam.html" title="">deaths of 300 people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee</a>.</p><p>“The U.S. should not be delivering weapons to the U.A.E. as it aids and abets this humanitarian disaster and gross human rights violations,” Mr. Van Hollen said in the statement. “We must stop this corrupt Trump family crypto-for-arms deal and use our leverage to prevent more suffering in Sudan — and bring its civil war to a peaceful resolution.”</p><p>A parallel effort is underway in the House. Representatives Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Sara Jacobs of California, the top Democrat on the Africa subcommittee, also introduced resolutions of disapproval targeting the Emirates arms sales.</p><p>The Arms Export Control Act gives Democrats a procedural tool to force Congress to debate these issues, one of the few maneuvers lawmakers in the minority have at their disposal to control what is brought up for a vote.</p><p>“If a foreign government is participating in this kind of nuclear-grade corruption by directly enriching the president and his family,” Mr. Murphy said, “we are going to force a full Senate debate on that behavior and a vote on their security relationship with the United States.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="35" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdkNWQ3OTQ2LTdhMWEtNWNkOS1iZGEzLTAyMDA0Yjk5NThkNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#doge-musk-gao-accountability-office" data-source-id="100000010174655"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-a-fahrenthold"><img alt="David A.

A spokesman for Mr. Musk’s group did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The confrontation between the two watchdog groups was first <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gao-audit-elon-musk-doge-government-agencies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> by Wired.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s group has audited agencies across government, and claims to have found $170 billion in savings, although that figure is inflated by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/upshot/doge-musk-trump-errors.html" title="">errors</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">guesswork</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-agencies.html" title="">zombie contracts</a> that were killed but later reinstated.</p><p>On the surface, the Government Accountability Office would seem less like a target and more like an ally of Mr. Musk’s group. The office audits federal programs for waste, fraud and mismanagement. Its budget is about <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-900570.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$900 million,</a> but the agency <a href="https://www.facebook.com/usgao/posts/did-you-know-that-for-every-1-invested-in-gao-in-fiscal-year-2024-we-saved-congr/987692976730909/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> it saves $76 for every dollar invested in its work.</p><p>But now the accountability office could become a roadblock for President Trump, who set Mr. Musk’s group in motion.</p><p>The older watchdog agency, led by Comptroller General Gene L. Dodaro, finds itself at the center of a brewing battle over a power known as impoundment, the ability of the president to halt the delivery of funds that have been appropriated by Congress.</p><p>In his sweeping reconfiguration of American government, Mr. Trump has claimed he has vast powers to direct the course of the nation’s spending. He and his leading budget adviser, Russell T. Vought, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/congress-trump-spending.html" title="">maintain that a 1970s law</a> restricting impoundment is unconstitutional, setting up a potential legal clash around the power over the nation’s purse.</p><p>Still, the statute empowers the Government Accountability Office to investigate potential violations, and in late April, Mr. Dodaro acknowledged his team had opened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-funds-gao.html" title="">more than three dozen probes</a> into reports that the Trump administration illegally withheld congressionally authorized funds.</p><p>“We’re trying to get information from the agencies about what their legal position is for not expending the money,” Mr. Dodaro told the Senate at a hearing, as he acknowledged some agencies had been “unresponsive” to the inquiries.</p><p>Mr. Dodaro did not signal how his office might proceed, but it has the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/what-impoundment-control-act-and-what-gaos-role" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">power under law</a> to sue the administration for violations.</p><p>A similar showdown arose at the end of Mr. Trump’s first term, as Democrats moved to impeach him. The Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/us/politics/gao-trump-ukraine.html" title="">found that the administration had violated</a> the law by illegally withholding roughly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in defiance of Congress, though the administration claimed it had acted lawfully.</p><p>Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Musk’s group has no power over the older watchdog group.</p><p>“The law is crystal clear: G.A.O. is a legislative branch agency not subject to DOGE or the president’s whims,” Ms. Murray said in a statement. “It is an indispensable, impartial government watchdog, and its independence must remain. My message to Elon and DOGE: get lost.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has already faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/library-of-congress-trump.html" title="">pushback</a> from legislators of both parties over his effort to take over another congressional institution: the Library of Congress. Mr. Trump recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/library-of-congress-trump.html" title="">fired the librarian of Congress</a> before the end of her term, and sought to replace her with his former personal lawyer, now a top official at the Department of Justice.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="33" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMzc5MTQ3MzgtNDFlMy01YjljLTk2OGMtODkzMmY3N2NhMzM3"><div id="37914738-41e3-5b9c-968c-8932f77ca337" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#37914738-41e3-5b9c-968c-8932f77ca337"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aishvarya-kavi"><img alt="Aishvarya Kavi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/11/us/politics/author-aishvarya-kavi/author-aishvarya-kavi-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/11/us/politics/author-aishvarya-kavi/author-aishvarya-kavi-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/11/us/politics/author-aishvarya-kavi/author-aishvarya-kavi-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T19:14:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 3:14 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>At a hearing on Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s case, the judge and lawyers for the Trump administration clashed over the legality of his deportation.

Powell, the chair of the central bank, announced the plan on Friday in an internal note to staff members reviewed by The New York Times. Certain employees will be eligible to participate in a voluntary deferred resignation program that is aimed at giving those close to retirement the option of an earlier exit. That offer will only apply to people at the Washington-based Board of Governors.</p><div><p>Cuts are expected to be made across the entire Federal Reserve System, including the 12 regional banks. Roughly 2,400 people will be affected.</p><p>“I have directed the leadership of the Federal Reserve, here at the Board and across the System, to find incremental ways to consolidate functions where appropriate, modernize some business practices, and ensure that we are right-sized and able to meet our statutory mission,” Mr. Powell said in the memo.</p><p>The Fed earlier this year imposed a hiring freeze on permanent workers as part of its efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/business/federal-reserve-trump-executive-orders.html" title="">align with the Trump administration’s decree</a> that no federal position vacant at the time could be filled nor could new positions be created. It also took steps to distance itself from diversity issues as well as those related to climate change — initiatives that President Trump has opposed.</p><p>The Fed is a politically independent institution, meaning it is not legally obligated to carry out orders by the executive branch. That buffer from the White House is being legally challenged by the Department of Justice, which has sought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-agency-leaders-firings.html" title="">more sway</a> over independent agencies.</p><p>The announcement made on Friday mirrors an effort by the Fed during the Clinton administration to cull its work force, which Mr. Powell cited in his note. At that time, there were “government-wide efforts to improve efficiency,” as was the case “now,” Mr. Powell said.</p><p>Yet at a congressional hearing in February, Mr. Powell pushed back on the idea that the Fed had too many employees. “Overworked, maybe, not overstaffed.”</p><p>Mr. Trump is pursuing a similar goal, although much more aggressively than past administrations have. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, led by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, has taken to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-doge-federal-job-cuts.html" title="">gutting</a> the federal work force, including shuttering agencies wholesale. Tens of thousands of government employees have since left their jobs.</p><p>The Fed’s decision is not tied to the ongoing initiative by DOGE, although some staff at the central bank were contacted earlier this year via email by Mr. Musk’s group, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>“The Federal Reserve is a careful and responsible steward of public resources,” Mr. Powell said in his note on Friday.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="30" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjE5NGFjMjEtNjRjNy01Yjc4LWIxY2QtNDA0MjIyMzhhODI3"><div id="6194ac21-64c7-5b78-b1cd-40422238a827" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#6194ac21-64c7-5b78-b1cd-40422238a827"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/catie-edmondson"><img alt="Catie Edmondson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbStandard-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T18:17:49.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 2:17 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Republicans on the House Budget Committee just announced the panel will reconvene on Sunday night at 10 p.m. to reconsider their party’s megabill that conservatives on the panel blocked today.

At the time of her resignation, a spokesperson for the department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/world/europe/us-ukraine-ambassador-resigns.html" title="">said in an email</a> that Ms. Brink had “been the ambassador there for three years — that’s a long time in a war zone.” And the State Department’s chief spokeswoman, Tammy Bruce, had declined to discuss the matter beyond saying, “We wish her well.”</p><p>During her time in Ukraine, Ms. Brink developed a reputation as a powerful voice for reform, taking aim at government corruption and working to build durable democratic institutions, sometimes irritating powerful officials in Kyiv.</p><p>Ms. Brink also toured the country to bear witness to the devastation being wrought by the Russian invasion.</p><p>“Over a career spent in conflict zones, I’ve seen mass atrocities and wanton destruction firsthand but we have never seen violence so systematic, so widespread and so horrifying in Europe since World War II,” Ms. Brink, a native of Michigan, wrote in the Detroit Free Press op-ed.</p><p>Ms. Brink added: “Russia’s war is about more than foreign policy or economics.

McElroy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. In that earlier ruling, she found that the government could not abruptly wipe out a pandemic-era funding stream that many state and local health departments relied upon. </p><div><p>In the opinion Judge McElroy issued on Friday, she wrote: “The health care funding terminations would constrain the States’ infectious disease research, thwart treatment efforts to those struggling with mental health and addiction, and impact the availability of vaccines to children, the elderly, and those living in rural communities. Not to mention that the terminations were effective immediately, ignoring the States’ reliance on the funds.” </p><p>The Department announced the cutoffs on March 24. A coalition of 23 states and the District of Columbia then sued to stop the sudden change, arguing that they had been given no time to prepare for budget shortfalls and could face devastating shortages in many critical treatment areas.</p><p>Judge McElroy on Friday directed federal health agencies to “take every step necessary to effectuate this order” while the case proceeds — namely, disbursing the funds, which had already been allocated by Congress for the purposes of the state programs. Notably, however, her order only applies to those jurisdictions involved in the lawsuit.</p><p>Judge McElroy’s rulings mean that funding will remain in place for that coalition of Democratic-led states, which together represent more than 185 million Americans, or a little over half of the United States population counted in the last census. </p><p>In defending the cuts, the Trump administration has argued that since the official end of the emergency over the coronavirus pandemic in 2023, the funding was no longer necessary. </p><p>The states behind the lawsuit countered that the funding was intended to address a variety of public health problems — some of them worsened by the onslaught of Covid-19 — and that, much like other federal funding streams the Trump administration has worked to cut off, the money was authorized by Congress and could not be lawfully cut off unilaterally by the health department.</p><p>Judge McElroy’s ruling noted that the funds helped address disease outbreaks beyond the coronavirus, including measles and avian flu; bolstered mental health and substance abuse services; and helped support clinics in underserved areas.<span>  </span></p><p>“Though Congress appropriated the funds during the pandemic,” she wrote, the funds “did much more than address Covid-related public health concerns.” </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzExOTU3MGFhLWU1NTktNTEwZC1iZTkwLTkwNjU5ZTJlMDZhNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#homeland-security-immigration-reality-show" data-source-id="100000010173839"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz"><img alt="Hamed Aleaziz" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T16:36:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 12:36 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rob Worsoff, a television producer, left, with Jack Osbourne in 2013.

She said the department was still reviewing the idea, which was pitched by a producer named Rob Worsoff.</p><div><p>“The pitch generally was a celebration of being an American and what a privilege it is to be able to be a citizen of the United States of America,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “It’s important to revive civic duty.”</p><p>She said the agency was happy to review “out-of-the-box pitches,” particularly those that celebrate “what it means to be an American.”</p><p>The project was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14713113/DHS-Secretary-Kristi-Noem-reality-TV-immigrants-compete-US-citizenship.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by The Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>Mr. Worsoff, a 49-year-old Canadian American, said he first thought of the idea during his own naturalization process. He said that immigrants in the show would compete in challenges in various states. He said one challenge could be highlighting NASA in Texas or Florida and seeing which immigrant could assemble and launch a rocket first. There would also be trivia or civic challenges.</p><p>The show would end with someone being sworn in as a U.S. citizen, Mr. Worsoff said.</p><p>“We need a national conversation of what it means to be American,” he said. “We need to be reminded of how proud and how much of an honor it is to be American.”</p><p>Mr. Worsoff said no one would be penalized in their immigration process or deported as a result.</p><p>“I think it’s nonsense because what’s going to happen is we’re going to get to know these people and their stories and their journeys, and we’re celebrating them as humans,” he said. “We’re putting a face to these people, to their journey.”</p><p>Mr. Worsoff said the actual details of what would happen in the show would depend on what TV networks wanted and what the Department of Homeland Security could do.

Without the support of Republican hard-liners on the Budget Committee, the bill cannot advance. But any changes to win their backing could alienate the more moderate Republicans whose votes will also be needed to pass the measure on the House floor.</p><p>Five Republicans representatives — Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania — joined Democrats in voting to block the legislation. The vote was 16 to 21 on a motion to advance the bill.</p><p>“This bill falls profoundly short; it does not do what we say it does with respect to deficits,” Mr. Roy said ahead of the vote, explaining his opposition. “Deficits will go up in the first half of the 10-year budget window, and we all know it’s true, and we shouldn’t do that. We shouldn’t say that we’re doing something we’re not doing.”</p><p>A few hours after the vote failed, committee leaders announced that the panel would reconvene Sunday at 10 p.m. to reconsider the legislation. It was not clear what, if any, changes Republican leaders agreed to before calling lawmakers back.</p><p>But immediately after the vote, they had not seemed optimistic: The committee’s chairman, Representative Jodey C. Arrington of Texas, told its members they could return home to their districts.</p><p>“Well, the noes have it,” Mr. Arrington said. “I want to thank everybody for their time and patience, and godspeed and safe travels.”</p><p>Mr. Smucker, who changed his “yes” vote to a “no” vote at the last minute, said he did so for procedural reasons. Because he voted against the bill, he will be able to ask to call the legislation back up for consideration once Republicans broker a deal.</p><p>The legislation the party is trying to push through would make Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay through 2028, fulfilling a campaign pledge. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and subsidies for clean energy would partly offset the roughly $3.8 trillion cost of those tax measures over 10 years, as well as increased spending on the military and immigration enforcement.</p><p>But the conservatives are demanding changes to the bill, arguing that their leaders did not go far enough to cut federal spending. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that calls for lower deficits, estimated that the bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. A number of House conservatives have said they do not want to vote for legislation unless it is deficit neutral.</p><p>The changes the conservatives seek cut to the heart of concerns from their most centrist colleagues. Chief among the hard-liners’ frustrations is that a measure imposing work requirements on childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities would not kick in until 2029.</p><p>“We’re telling a healthy body, a healthy American, that you’ve got four years to get a job,” Mr. Norman said.</p><p>They are also unhappy that the legislation does not immediately eliminate a slew of clean energy tax credits that were created by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>Mr. Brecheen said that he worried the gradual rollback of some of those tax credits would simply never materialize, citing his efforts in the Oklahoma State Legislature to repeal wind tax credits.</p><p>“It was always the promise to end them many years from now, which never materialized,” he said, adding, “I know no other way to foretell the future than by the past.”</p><p>The legislation’s provisions on both Medicaid and the clean energy tax credits were written in an effort to split the difference between the conservatives who have been clamoring for deep cuts to both and more centrist Republicans who say their constituents depend on the programs.</p><p>Politically vulnerable Republicans in particular have warned that voting for a measure that would ax widely used federal programs would be politically toxic.</p><p>House Republican leaders had attempted to soothe the conservatives on the panel, meeting with them on Thursday and again on Friday morning, hoping to win their support by offering to move up the timeline for Medicaid work requirements to kick in.</p><p>And as the panel was convening on Friday, Mr. Trump weighed in on social media, writing that “Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!”</p><p>“We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party,” he added. “STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!”</p><p>But those efforts were not enough. Many of the conservatives view reducing the nation’s debt as their raison d’être for running for Congress.</p><p>“I’m not going to sit here and say that everything is hunky-dory when this is the Budget Committee,” Mr. Roy said. “This is the Budget Committee. We are supposed to do something to actually result in balanced budgets, but we’re not doing it.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZmEyMGY0MGItZjZiOS01ZGM2LWI1MDUtMTUxZmM5Y2IwN2M4"><div id="fa20f40b-f6b9-5dc6-b505-151fc9cb07c8" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#fa20f40b-f6b9-5dc6-b505-151fc9cb07c8"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/catie-edmondson"><img alt="Catie Edmondson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbStandard-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T15:07:20.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 11:07 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>A fourth Republican on the panel, Representative Andrew Clyde of Georgia, said the bill “fails to deliver the transformative change that Americans were promised.” He says “substantive improvements are needed.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNmNhMTY4MzQtZjdhYy01YTllLWFkODEtMjVlYTU1NWRjZTg3"><div id="6ca16834-f7ac-5a9e-ad81-25ea555dce87" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#6ca16834-f7ac-5a9e-ad81-25ea555dce87"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/catie-edmondson"><img alt="Catie Edmondson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbStandard-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T15:06:25.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 11:06 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>A third conservative, Representative Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, does not say how he is going to vote, but sounds very pessimistic about the legislation.

Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, have described the tax bill as helping everyday Americans, economists have found that its most generous and lasting benefits will go to the wealthy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As Representative Jason Smith commenced a marathon session this week to consider a sprawling and expensive Republican tax package, he took special care to emphasize his party’s commitment to “hard-working Americans.”</p><p>“Pro-growth tax policy will shift our economy toward one that serves them, not the wealthy and well-connected,” Mr. Smith, the Missouri lawmaker who leads the House’s top tax panel, proclaimed.</p><div><p>But the proposal he is trying to get to President Trump’s desk ultimately tells a more complicated story. The Republican tax plan may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, according to a wide range of tax experts, and some taxpayers may actually be left in worse financial shape if the bill becomes law.</p><p>The latest assessment arrived Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan scorekeeper closely watched on Capitol Hill. Economists found that many Americans who make less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026.</p><p>The Penn Wharton estimate sought to analyze the full scope of the Republican tax package, computing the effects of the tax cuts as well as the plan to pay for them by slashing federal spending on other programs, including Medicaid and food stamps. Combined, those policies could fall disproportionately on the poorest, including those near or below the poverty line, the economists found.</p><p>People making between about $51,000 and $17,000 could lose about $700 on average in after-tax income beginning in 2026, according to the analysis, when factoring in both wages and federal aid. That reduction would worsen over the next eight years. People reporting less than $17,000 in income would see a reduction closer to $1,000, on average, also increasing over time, a shortfall that underscores their reliance on federal benefits.</p><p>By contrast, the top 0.1 percent, including those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain on average more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026, the data show. These earners benefit more from a Republican measure because it cuts taxes on the wealthy and makes other favorable changes, including for businesses, which may improve the value of their investments.</p><p>Penn Wharton did not factor economic growth into its projections. In recent days, Republicans have vigorously rejected any assertion that their bill is better for the richest Americans, arguing that it would generate substantial economic returns and deliver new jobs and rising wages in the process.</p><p>The legislation would extend a set of tax cuts on individuals and businesses that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies passed in 2017. That extension would stave off the “largest tax hike in American history,” Mr. Smith, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said at a hearing Tuesday. His office declined to comment.</p><p>The discrepancy highlights both the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the sheer scope of the changes that House Republicans seek. Much of their tax agenda remains a work in progress, as party leaders continue to grapple with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/republicans-domestic-policy-bill.html" title="">simmering divisions in their ranks</a> and growing demands for changes from their counterparts in the Senate.</p><p>The extent of those fissures became clear on Friday, after a g<a href="#house-republicans-policy-bil" title="">roup of conservative Republicans voted</a> to block their party’s tax package from heading to the House floor. They demanded additional spending cuts, sending the party’s leaders scrambling, even though Mr. Trump had called on lawmakers hours earlier to unite around the bill.</p><p>“We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party,” the president wrote on social media. “STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!”</p><p>At the core of the effort, Republicans are racing to preserve the policies they enacted for Mr. Trump in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. The sprawling law changed the way taxpayers calculate their annual bills while lowering the corporate rate to 21 percent and the tax rate on the highest-earning individuals to 37 percent.</p><p>Republicans consider the law a resounding success. In a report issued in April, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the 2017 tax cuts increased the nation’s total economic output, which was 2.5 percent higher at the end of 2019 compared with the period before the law was enacted, while growing real wages by nearly $5,000.</p><p>“It helped set us up for a better economic situation going into the pandemic,” said Matthew D. Dickerson, the director of budget policy at the conservative-leaning Economic Policy Innovation Center.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump’s agenda may offer only modest gains to workers, some of whom may actually be left in worse financial shape if the House Republicans’ bill were to become law.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L.

Reviewing its economic and fiscal effects last year, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, found that an extension would again cut taxes for most Americans, but nearly <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/feature/reassessing-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half of its benefits</a> would flow to those who make <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/those-making-450000-and-would-get-nearly-half-benefit-extending-tcja" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$450,000 a year or more.</a></p><p>“Delivering tax relief that way, it’s sort of unavoidable to not have most of the benefits go to higher-income people,” said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.</p><p>In reprising that approach, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies unveiled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/house-gop-tax-bill-trump.html" title="">bevy of additions</a> they have described as a boon for everyday workers. For individual taxpayers, they proposed to raise the standard deduction by $1,000, while aiming to lift it by $4,000 for seniors, in a move meant to replace the president’s promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security.</p><p>House Republican lawmakers also proposed adding $500 to the child tax credit, which families can receive through their tax filings annually, and they looked to end federal taxes on tips and overtime pay, as requested by Mr. Trump.</p><p>Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said in an interview this week on CNBC that the president had instructed Congress to “go after the things that are going to help middle-class folks.”</p><p>The sum of those proposals could help reduce many workers’ tax bills, according to early analyses. One report this week from the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/big-beautiful-bill-house-gop-tax-plan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tax Foundation</a>, a research center that generally favors lower taxes, found that the legislation would increase market incomes — a measure of income that includes wages and other elements — by 4.4 percent on average in 2026.</p><p>But Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the organization, said the benefits would not be parceled out equally, resulting in the “larger increases in after-tax income for the top 5 percent of taxpayers.”</p><p>Asked about the early findings, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that the president’s “‘one big, beautiful bill’ will continue to prove the haters wrong.”</p><p>Mr. Fields also pointed to the <a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications/2025/jcx-23-25/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">findings of the Joint Committee on Taxation</a>, a nonpartisan budget keeper on Capitol Hill. Its report, issued Tuesday, showed most Americans would see a tax cut under the House measure, though some lower-income taxpayers could see increases. That may be because some of Republicans’ proposed tax cuts targeting workers are temporary and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-temporary.html" title="">would expire within the next 10 years</a>.</p><p>But the tax scorekeepers only captured some of the effects of Republicans’ agenda. In the House, party leaders have moved to offset their proposal with an expansive set of cuts to a wide variety of federal agencies, programs and tax credits, some of which serve those with lower incomes.</p><p>House Republicans chose, for example, to tighten eligibility for tax credits that help millions of Americans purchase health insurance. Party leaders also proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">deep reductions in Medicaid</a>, which offers coverage to the poor, and food stamps.</p><p>Under each of those changes, millions of Americans stand to lose access to federal safety net benefits, according to the government’s own estimates in recent months. Those losses threaten to overshadow any gains among some of those families from the president’s campaign to slash taxes, some data show.</p><p>“It is dishonest to pretend the tax analysis is a full representation of the bill,” said Brendan Duke, the senior director for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group.</p><p>In his own <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/how-house-republican-agenda-boosts-the-wealthy-does-little-or-worse-for-low-income-families" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">number crunching</a>, Mr. Duke found that the after-tax income of people making over $1 million would rise by 4.3 percent in 2027, translating to an average gain of more than $89,000. His analysis incorporated a Republican plan to relax the estate tax, which benefits higher earners.</p><p>But Mr. Duke found that the bottom fifth of all American earners would see only a 0.6 improvement in their after-tax income, which on average equals about $90. His analysis did not include the effects of spending cuts in programs like Medicaid.</p><p>The savings nonetheless help to offset a package that introduces a series of permanent tax changes that carry great benefits for the wealthy.</p><p>House Republicans have proposed a higher threshold for triggering the estate tax, which eases the financial burden on wealthier Americans who pass down large inheritances, along with a 23 percent deduction for so-called pass-through income, which reduces taxes on business income taxed at the individual rates of an owner.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/trump-new-tax-bracket.html" title="">did call for raising taxes on the wealthy</a>, particularly by creating a new tax bracket for people making more than $2.5 million a year. But the president later backed away from that push as he faced an onslaught of criticism from members of his own party. Even Mr. Trump later admitted the idea would be “very disruptive.”</p><p>“The Bill is GREAT,” the president <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114495946485549840" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on Truth Social this week, as House Republicans began to advance key portions of his tax agenda, adding: “The Golden Age of America will soon be upon us.”</p><p>Andrew Duehren<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNWQ5NGI3NzUtN2RmOC01YzQxLWJlOTctNTg0ZmVlNzExMTI5"><div id="5d94b775-7df8-5c41-be97-584fee711129" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#5d94b775-7df8-5c41-be97-584fee711129"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/catie-edmondson"><img alt="Catie Edmondson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbStandard-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T14:45:42.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 10:45 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The conservative holdouts on the House Budget Committee met with Republican leaders this morning at the Capitol before the committee meeting.

That was seen by Iranian commentators as a sign that he was willing to abandon the maximalist position of shutting down Iran’s nuclear program.</p><p>On his trip, Mr. Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-middle-east-syria-qatar-saudi-arabia-8bd63b3f9fc1856532a00adf1795e38f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked for help</a> from Qatar, which has played the role of intermediary between the United States and Iran, in reaching an agreement. In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Trump also heaped praise on Qatar and said that Iran was “very lucky” to have such an ally.</p><h2 id="link-426732b">He made an unusual reference to suffering in Gaza.</h2><p>Mr. Trump did not visit America’s biggest regional ally, Israel, and largely sidestepped the conflict in Gaza even as Israeli strikes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza.html" title="">killed dozens</a> of Palestinians across the territory over the past week.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians leaving their homes in Beit Lahia, in Gaza on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But on Friday, he said he wanted to see the conflict resolved and made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/trump-gaza-starvation-famine-us-israel-aid.html" title="">a rare acknowledgment</a> of the civilian suffering in Gaza. “There’s a lot of people starving, a lot of bad things going on,” he said. Mr. Trump has remained largely silent on Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-starvation-israel.html" title="">as the civilian toll mounts</a>. After his turnaround on Syria, Gulf Arab leaders who met with Mr. Trump seized on the opportunity to address that stance. His seemingly more sympathetic tone on Gaza was a notable shift given his longstanding close relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p><h2 id="link-3ef661c0">Russia-Ukraine talks loomed in the background, but Trump stayed away.</h2><p>Mr. Trump kept people guessing over whether he would extend his trip by traveling to Turkey, where cease-fire talks involving Russia and Ukraine were going on. Ultimately he decided not to go.</p><p>Russian and Ukrainian officials were in Istanbul for talks, along with top Trump administration officials, but President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was not attending and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">expectations for a breakthrough were low</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump himself lowered expectations in comments on Thursday, saying nothing meaningful would happen until he met personally with Mr. Putin. On Friday, Mr. Trump said he might call the Russian leader and would meet him “as soon as we can set it up.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Y1NGE4MjRiLWVkZTEtNTFmYy1hM2MyLThjMmFlYWNjMjY3Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#doj-trump-deportation-abrego-garcia" data-source-id="100000010168813"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-feuer"><img alt="Alan Feuer" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T09:02:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 5:02 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The federal courthouse in Greenbelt, Md. The Justice Department has argued that many of details of the deportation case involving Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia should not be made public because they amount to state secrets.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-deported-migrant.html" title="">has been more than a month</a> since the Supreme Court ordered the White House to work toward securing the release of a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador in March.</p><p>Top administration officials — including President Trump himself — have repeatedly said that the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, will not be coming back to the United States, largely because of accusations that he is a member of the violent street gang MS-13.</p><div><p>Their public statements have raised significant questions about whether the administration is openly defying the Supreme Court’s instructions — and what, if anything, might be done about that.</p><p>But even as those weighty issues simmer in the background, the White House is confronting a more immediate concern: whether it has been abiding by a separate court order to answer questions about the way it has been handling the case.</p><p>On Friday, lawyers for the Justice Department are scheduled to appear in Federal District Court in Maryland to defend their latest effort to avoid disclosing details about several key aspects of the proceeding. Those include the diplomatic steps that officials have taken in the past few weeks toward releasing Mr. Abrego Garcia, as well as the nature of the deal between the White House and the Salvadoran government to house deported immigrants in its jails.</p><p>The Justice Department has argued that many of those details should not be made public because they amount to state secrets. In fact, in a declaration filed last week mostly under seal, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the disclosure of such material “could be expected to cause significant harm to the foreign relations and national security interests of the United States.”</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Abrego Garcia have scoffed at the idea that the government’s efforts to free their client from El Salvador should be considered a state secret, especially given that Mr. Trump and some of his top aides have been talking publicly about the man for weeks.</p><p>“On its face, there is little reason to believe that compliance with a court order to facilitate the release and return of a single mistakenly removed individual so that he can get his day in court implicates state secrets at all,” the lawyers wrote in a court filing this week. “No military or intelligence operations are involved, and it defies reason to imagine that the United States’ relationship with El Salvador would be endangered by any effort to seek the return of a wrongfully deported person who the government admits never should have been removed to El Salvador in the first place.”</p><p>Judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the proceeding, will hear both sides of this debate on Friday and eventually determine whether to let the government use what is known as the state secrets privilege and other legal protections to keep its internal deliberations under wraps. The hearing in front of her could become contentious, if only because the administration has for weeks been stonewalling her efforts to get to the bottom of how it has been handling the Abrego Garcia case.</p><p>In early April, for example, the judge determined that the White House had failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s instructions to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from Salvadoran custody. As an initial remedy, she ordered the government to provide her with daily updates about what steps it had taken and planned to take to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia’s freedom.</p><p>Then, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/appeals-court-white-house-deportee.html" title="">a federal appeals court directed officials to take a more proactive role</a> in getting him out of custody, Judge Xinis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/trump-abrego-garcia-deported-hearing.html" title="">opened an investigation into what exactly the administration had been doing.</a> As part of that inquiry, she ordered Trump officials to answer questions — both in person and in writing — about the deal they had reached to house deported immigrants in El Salvador and what had been done to free Mr. Abrego Garcia from the notorious mega-prison there known as CECOT.</p><p>But that process also broke down and Judge Xinis quickly blasted the government for what she called its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/trump-justice-department-abrego-garcia-el-salvador.html" title="">“willful and bad faith refusal”</a> to adequately answer the questions. Just as she appeared to be losing patience, the Justice Department asked her for a pause in the question-asking process, suggesting there had been a diplomatic development that justified a seven-day delay.</p><p>The New York Times reported that around that time, officials at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-abrego-garcia-bukele-el-salvador.html" title="">the State Department had sent a note to their counterparts in El Salvador</a> inquiring about having Mr. Abrego Garcia released, but El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, rejected the offer.</p><p>In the end, Judge Xinis granted the Justice Department’s request for a delay, but denied department lawyers when they asked her for a second weeklong pause. Last week, finally faced with having to answer questions about the case, department lawyers countered with their latest legal maneuver: an invocation of the state secrets privilege.</p><p>It was not the first time that the administration tried the same tactic in a deportation case.</p><p>In late March, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/judge-ruling-trump-deportations-alien-enemies-act.html" title="">invoked the state secrets privilege in an effort to avoid providing data to a federal judge in Washington</a> about three charter planes that flew to El Salvador that month carrying Mr. Abrego Garcia and scores of other immigrants.</p><p>The judge in that case, James E. Boasberg, wanted the data in an effort to determine whether the government had flouted his order to turn the planes around. Judge Boasberg’s investigation into the White House’s compliance with his ruling was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/court-contempt-trump-deportations.html" title="">temporarily put on hold last month by the federal appeals court</a> that sits over him.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
