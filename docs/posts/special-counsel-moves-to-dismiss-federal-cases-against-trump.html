    <h1>Special Counsel Moves to Dismiss Federal Cases Against Trump</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Jack Smith, the special counsel who charged Donald Trump with 44 criminal counts across a pair of felony cases, asked two separate courts today to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/us/politics/jack-smith-trump-election-documents-charges.html" title="">drop the charges against the president-elect</a>. Within hours, one of the cases was dismissed.</p><p>In both filings, Smith said that the move was a necessity because of the Justice Department’s policy that it is unconstitutional to prosecute sitting presidents. He made clear that it had nothing to do with the strength of the cases. Smith had accused Trump of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/trump-investigations-charges-indictments.html" title="">illegally plotting to subvert the 2020 election and unlawfully holding on to scores of classified documents</a> after he left the White House in 2021. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who oversaw the election case, officially dismissed the proceeding today.</p><p>“This is all but the final nail in the coffin,” my colleague Alan Feuer, who covered the Trump cases, told me. “Smith is acknowledging that prosecutors won’t be able to keep the cases going with Trump set to return to the White House.”</p><p>Smith and his team are planning to complete their work, and file a final report, in the next two months. The president-elect had vowed to fire Smith within “two seconds” of taking office and to launch investigations into the prosecutors who pursued him along with other perceived enemies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The aftermath of Israeli airstrikes in Beirut, Lebanon, today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4b9caa42">Israel is nearing a decision on a Lebanon cease-fire</h2><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to meet with his cabinet tomorrow to discuss whether to agree to a truce in Lebanon, where Israeli troops have been fighting Hezbollah. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/world/americas/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-strikes-ceasefire.html" title="">Netanyahu has signaled that he is open to a cease-fire</a>, officials said, but he is seeking clearer assurances on how Israel could restart the fighting if Hezbollah breaks the agreement.</p><p>U.S. officials have been putting pressure on Israel to finalize a deal before Thanksgiving.
