    <h1>The New Threat to Brazil’s Forests: Chemicals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Brazil’s satellites did not detect anything alarming. Yet down on the ground, the trees were dying.</p><p>Slowly but surely, a stretch of protected forest the size of New York City was drying out. Leaves were falling off the trees, and, as the sun spilled through the disintegrating canopy, pastures of grass were sprouting below.</p><p>It was all intentional.</p><p>When Brazilian authorities responded to anonymous complaints about the destruction last year, they found troves of empty herbicide containers. Cattle roamed on some of the newly grown pastures.</p><p>The land was owned by Claudecy Oliveira Lemes, a rancher who has supplied some of the world’s biggest meatpackers, including JBS, a Brazilian beef giant that exports to the United States.</p><p>Mr. Lemes is now also a defendant, charged this month with committing one of the single biggest acts of illegal deforestation in Brazil. The authorities are seeking nearly $1 billion in compensation. Mr. Lemes has denied any wrongdoing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>What separates Mr. Lemes from the thousands of other loggers and ranchers who have razed stretches of the Amazon and other forests across Brazil is that he employed what the authorities say is a dangerous new technique: chemical deforestation.</p><p>In other words, he used chemicals, instead of chain saws, to clear the forest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As governments try to advance their fight against deforestation, criminals are finding new ways to take down trees for profit. In South America, chemical deforestation is one of the newest battlefronts.</p><p>“It’s more difficult to detect, it looks like a fire and you can deforest thousands of hectares in a short time,” said Ana Luiza Peterlini, the prosecutor overseeing the case against Mr. Lemes. The criminals, she said, “are always ahead of us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/18/multimedia/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/18/multimedia/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/18/multimedia/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="White cattle dot a landscape of green grass and trees and water as shown from an aerial vantage point." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/18/multimedia/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/18/multimedia/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/18/multimedia/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/18/multimedia/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq/00brazil-deforestation01-photo-zcvq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c73e3f77-3b91-55c1-90f6-41eb9d928328" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A cattle ranch in the Pantanal, the region in Brazil where Claudecy Oliveira Lemes’s ranch is.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lalo de Almeida for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Ms. Peterlini and other officials said that they believed ranchers were turning to chemicals in order to avoid detection via satellite-monitoring systems, one of the primary defenses against deforestation.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Those systems generally search for the abrupt disappearance of forest, which is typically evidence of clear-cutting, or burning. Herbicides cause trees to slowly lose their leaves, then dry out and die, making it difficult to differentiate the process from a natural tree death.</p><p>That is why the authorities believe chemicals are being used more often than they know of. In some cases, the authorities said, ranchers use chemicals to dry out the forest and make it easier to burn. The resulting fire then destroys evidence that chemicals had ever been used.</p><p>“We have no doubt that it’s a very common practice,” said Rodrigo Agostinho, the head of Ibama, Brazil’s environmental enforcement agency. “On the other hand, we have tremendous difficulty proving it.”</p><p>In Brazil, no agency keeps a national tally of incidents involving chemical deforestation. Aside from the area in Mr. Lemes’s case, at least another 180 square miles have been deforested using pesticides in Brazil since 2010, according to surveys by <a href="https://reporterbrasil.org.br/2021/11/fazendeiros-jogam-agrotoxico-sobre-amazonia-para-acelerar-desmatamento/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Repórter Brasil</a>, an investigative journalism outlet, and other environmental organizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Chemical deforestation poses a more insidious threat than traditional means of clearing because it can leave behind longer-lasting damage to the environment and to wildlife.</p><p>The chemicals contaminate the soil, killing microorganisms and insects, and potentially reaching into the groundwater. Rain can also wash the chemicals into rivers, killing algae and phytoplankton and disrupting aquatic food chains.</p><p>Aerial spraying has also harmed people. In 2021, nearly 400 people in the Wawi Indigenous territory <a href="https://www.nationalgeographicbrasil.com/cultura/2022/05/a-jornada-de-uma-aldeia-amazonica-para-escapar-do-avanco-da-soja" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had to move their village</a> because chemicals were being sprayed on areas of the Amazonian forest where they farmed and collected honey.</p><p>In June, students and teachers in the rural Amazon town of Belterra were rushed to a health clinic with symptoms of poisoning after their school grounds <a href="https://apublica.org/2024/09/belterra-de-cemiterio-ilhado-a-escola-poluida-pelo-agronegocio/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were sprayed</a> with chemicals on at least three occasions.</p><p>And in recent years, some municipalities have banned aerial spraying after multiple contamination incidents. That includes a case this year in the small town of Timbiras, in Brazil’s northeast, where a plane sprayed agrochemicals over 65 square miles of babaçu groves, a protected tree species.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But there has been no case like Mr. Lemes’s.</p><p>Brazilian prosecutors accuse Mr. Lemes of hiring a plane to spray chemicals across 300 square miles of forest in order to raise cattle there. The chemicals killed many trees, turning them gray and leafless, but leaving their corpses standing.</p><p>Drone images months later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThJqsTAzTvM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showed vast areas of gray, dead trees</a> mixed among the still living vegetation.</p><p>The property was owned by Mr. Lemes. Because it was located in the Pantanal — the world’s largest wetlands, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/americas/pantanal-wildfires-wildlife.html" title="">rich with rare wildlife</a> — there were restrictions on how he could use it. He could raise cattle and could clear some land with permits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bats fly over vegetation in the Pantanal near Corumba, Brazil.

Mr. Lemes has also been fined for deforestation in the area in the past.</p><p>Most trees in the Pantanal are not highly valuable for commercial sales, and killing them to raise cattle is more profitable. In other regions of Brazil, including the Amazon, criminals often prefer to cut down the trees and haul them off for sale.</p><p>In the Pantanal, an anonymous tip alerted the authorities to the deforestation. Mauren Lazzaretti, environmental secretary in the Brazilian state where the case occurred, said her department was working with a local university to adjust their monitoring systems to spot such chemical deforestation.</p><p>The case also highlights the link between deforestation and the meat sold in supermarkets, and a practice known as “cattle laundering,” in which cows raised on deforested land are passed through legal farms before heading to slaughter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>First, Mr. Lemes raised cattle on land of his that had been sprayed with chemicals, according to prosecutors. Then cattle from that land were transferred to another farm owned by Mr. Lemes, according to private transfer records obtained by Repórter Brasil for a project commissioned by an environmental advocacy organization, Mighty Earth.</p><p>Next, cattle from that second farm were transferred to two slaughterhouses run by JBS, the meatpacking giant, according to the records.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Beef is processed at a JBS plant in Parnaiba, Brazil, in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Whitaker/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In effect, the records showed that cattle raised on the chemically deforested land had been laundered through another farm before ending up in a commercial slaughterhouse, according to Mighty Earth.</p><p>Mighty Earth then found that the two JBS slaughterhouses had supplied grocery stores across Brazil, including Carrefour, a multinational food chain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“These supermarkets are buying cattle coming from the farms where deforestation occurred,” said Mariana Gameiro, senior adviser at Mighty Earth. “We cannot say that the cow that was in this farm is now in the supermarket, but we can surely say that they have commercial links.”</p><p>JBS said in a statement that farms owned by Mr. Lemes previously supplied its slaughterhouses, but have now been blocked as suppliers. JBS added that it was difficult to monitor the cattle supply chain before cows ended up in its slaughterhouses.</p><p>Carrefour Brazil said it did not buy meat from Mr. Lemes’s farms. Mighty Earth said that meat available at the company’s stores came from slaughterhouses supplied by Mr. Lemes.</p><p>Lis Moriconi<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief for The Times, based in Rio de Janeiro, where he leads coverage of much of South America.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>12</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Sneakier Than Fire, Chemicals Kill Brazil’s Trees<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
