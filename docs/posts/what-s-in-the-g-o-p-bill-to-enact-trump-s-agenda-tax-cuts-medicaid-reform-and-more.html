Behind the scenes, Speaker Mike Johnson haggled with holdouts and Mr. Trump sought to persuade conservative Republicans, who have withheld their support because of concerns that it would swell the federal deficit, to get on board. They were one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/republican-tax-bill-factions.html" title="">several factions pushing for changes to the bill</a>, forcing party leaders to the negotiating table to cobble together the votes to pass it.</p><p>The legislation would slash taxes, providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement, while cutting health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost.</p><p>Major portions of the sprawling package remain unresolved amid Republican divisions over cuts to Medicaid and details of the tax plan, among other issues. The changes that the hard-liners on the Budget Committee have called for — including speeding up when new work requirements for Medicaid would kick in and a wholesale repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act — could alienate more moderate Republicans whose support is also crucial to passing the legislation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Republicans are pushing the package through Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/15/us/politics/trump-budget-reconciliation-process.html" title="">using a special process known as budget reconciliation</a> that allows them to steer around a filibuster and win approval without a single Democratic vote. But with tiny majorities in both chambers, they can afford to lose no more than three Republican votes in both the House and the Senate if all Democrats oppose it, as expected, and every member is present and voting.</p><p>Here is a look at the bill, and the biggest remaining areas of disagreement within the party.</p><h2 id="link-6942c54">Cutting taxes</h2><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The heart of the bill is a roughly $3.8 trillion tax cut that would lock in many of the tax cuts Republicans passed in 2017, including lower marginal income rates, a larger standard deduction and a higher threshold for the estate tax, with some tweaks.</p><p>The measure also includes several new, temporary tax cuts that Mr. Trump campaigned on, including his promises not to tax tips or overtime. His pitch not to tax Social Security benefits takes the form of a bonus $4,000 deduction available to Americans over 65, with the benefit shrinking at higher income levels. Americans would also be able to deduct interest on car loans from their taxable income, though the car has to be made in the United States.</p><p>The reductions would last only through 2028, as would a $1,000 addition to the standard deduction and a $500 bonus to the child tax credit, which now maxes out at $2,000. Children born over the next four years would receive $1,000 deposited in a so-called “MAGA account” that is invested in the stock market.</p><p>Businesses would receive several tax cuts, including valuable deductions for research and investment spending, as well as a new tax break for building factories. A deduction available to the owners of many businesses would become slightly more generous and be extended indefinitely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The bill also includes tax hikes on universities, noncitizens and some families with children. A tax on the investment income that university endowments earn would rise substantially, from 1.4 percent to as high as 21 percent. Immigrants authorized to live in the United States — but who are not citizens or green card holders — would be barred from receiving tax credits covering the cost of health insurance premiums. And tighter eligibility rules for the child tax credit would take the benefit away from roughly two million children.</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> The biggest problem for the tax plan, for now, is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/nyregion/salt-tax-deduction.html" title="">state and local tax deduction</a>. The bill would triple the current $10,000 limit on the cap to $30,000. But a group of holdout Republicans from high-tax states like New York have demanded an even higher increase to the cap, a challenging prospect for Republican leaders who also need the support of conservatives who hate the expensive tax break.</p><h2 id="link-354e64d1">Scaling back Medicaid</h2><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The bill makes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">major changes to reduce the cost of the health insurance program for the poor</a> and disabled. The centerpiece of those efforts is a strict work requirement for childless adults without disabilities, which would require beneficiaries to document 80 hours of monthly work, or prove they qualified for an exception, or else risk losing their benefits. Those new rules would not kick in until 2029, after the next presidential election.</p><p>More immediately, the legislation would make it easier for states to cancel people’s coverage by allowing them to increase paperwork requirements and drop those who don’t respond to requests to verify their income or residency. It also would require states to impose co-payments for a wide array of medical services for adults on Medicaid who live above the poverty line, a policy some Democrats described as a “sick tax.”</p><p>Another provision would reduce Medicaid funding to states that use their own tax revenues to provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants, a change that could affect financing for 12 mostly Democratic-controlled states. The legislation would bar Medicaid from providing funding to Planned Parenthood as long as the organization continued to provide abortions. And the bill would limit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/upshot/medicaid-hospitals-republicans-cuts.html" title="">strategies that states have developed</a> to tax medical providers and pay them higher prices for Medicaid services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Taken together with policies that would affect private Obamacare coverage, the <a href="https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/cbo-emails-re-e%26c-reconcilation-scores-may-11%2C-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Congressional Budget Office estimated</a> that the legislation would cause 8.6 million more Americans to be uninsured at the end of a decade, while reducing federal spending on health care by more than $700 billion. That estimate may be updated in the coming weeks as the office continues to analyze the bill.</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> Democrats have made the Medicaid changes the main focus of their critique of the bill, arguing that Republicans are slashing health coverage for poor Americans to finance tax cuts for the rich. In an effort to insulate their most vulnerable incumbents from backlash, G.O.P. leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">omitted overhaul proposals</a> that would have permanently changed the structure of the program. But one populist Republican, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, has called the cuts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/14/us/trump-news-middle-east#senator-josh-hawley-a-missouri-republican-opposes-the-house-gop-plan-for-medicaid-cuts" title="">a nonstarter</a>, saying they amount to “taxing the poor to give to the rich.” And some conservative lawmakers in the House who wanted much larger reductions are disappointed with the scale of the changes and the delayed implementation of the work requirement.</p><h2 id="link-7cb0e994">Ending clean energy programs</h2><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The bill would sharply curtail most of the big tax credits for clean energy contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Many of those incentives were expected to last a decade and have so far led businesses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/climate/ira-repubican-tax-bill-clean-energy.html" title="">to announce more than $841 billion in investments</a>, from wind farms in Wyoming to battery factories in Georgia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tax credits for low-emissions electricity sources like wind would be available in full only to power plants in service before the end of 2028.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Among the major changes: A $7,500 tax break for buyers of electric cars <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/republican-budget-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html" title="">would largely phase out</a> by the end of 2025, with a one-year extension for automakers that have not sold many models yet. Tax credits for low-emissions electricity sources like wind, solar, nuclear and geothermal power would be available in full only to power plants in service before the end of 2028, and then would zero out within three years. A credit for making hydrogen fuels would end this year.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The bill would also impose new “foreign entity of concern” restrictions on tax breaks for both power plants and factories that build solar panels, batteries or other low-carbon technologies by disqualifying companies that use components from China. That’s a steep hurdle, since China dominates global supply chains. The bill would also end by 2028 a practice that allowed smaller firms with little tax liability to claim the credits and sell them for cash, making the incentives more widely accessible.</p><p>Not all energy sources were affected. A tax credit for biofuels, which is popular in farm states, received a four-year extension in the bill. And a credit for capturing carbon dioxide from polluting facilities and burying it underground, which is backed by oil and gas companies, was mostly kept intact.</p><p>Other portions of the bill would expedite federal approvals for oil and gas projects in exchange for up to $10 million in fees, scrap Biden-era rules on tailpipe pollution from cars and trucks and repeal an E.P.A. program aimed at curbing methane leaks from oil and gas operations. The legislation also pulls back unspent funds from the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, which has nearly $400 billion in lending authority for emerging technologies.</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> Slashing the energy credits has been contentious even among Republicans, since more than three-quarters of the investments driven by the Inflation Reduction Act have occurred in red districts. At least three dozen Republicans in the House and four in the Senate have spoken out in favor of preserving at least some of the incentives, such as for nuclear power or domestic manufacturing, to protect jobs and bolster U.S. energy security.</p><h2 id="link-380179fa">Slashing food stamps</h2><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> In a bid to save money and restrict benefits, the bill would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-taxes-snap-program.html" title="">make a series of changes</a> to scale back the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides monthly aid known as food stamps to about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=109895" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">42 million low-income people</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Under the proposal, food stamp recipients between the ages of 18 and 64 would have to obtain work in order to receive federal aid. That mandate would also apply to parents with children 7 and older. Current law subjects only beneficiaries up to age 54 to work requirements, and carves out parents with dependents.</p><p>Additionally, the bill would force states to shoulder some of the costs of SNAP, which historically has been funded by the federal government. It would limit the ability of future administrations to raise food stamp benefit amounts. And SNAP would be restricted to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.</p><p>By Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had not released an analysis about the full effects of these and other changes. Past reports about <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-09/hr1581_letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar proposals</a> have found that strict work requirements could result in millions of food stamp recipients losing access to benefits.</p><p>The changes to SNAP would also have indirect effects on school nutrition programs. Many children automatically qualify for free lunches because their families are eligible for SNAP. Poor children whose parents lose SNAP coverage under the legislation would have to individually apply. Reductions in SNAP enrollment would also affect which public schools qualify for universal free lunch programs, which rely on the share of neighborhood families with nutrition benefits</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> Some Republicans from districts with high concentrations of food stamp recipients have balked in the past at cuts to the program, and insisted on allowing states to relax work requirements, which the bill would limit their ability to do. But so far, there has been no outcry in the G.O.P. against the SNAP cuts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-5d0fec26">Boosting national security and immigration enforcement</h2><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The plan would devote an additional $150 billion in military spending, to help boost shipbuilding efforts, and to build a new space-based missile defense system Mr. Trump has proposed that the military is calling <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4127682/dods-acquisition-community-already-working-on-golden-dome-big-team-effort-requi/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Dome</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Military troops listening to Mr. Trump speak in Qatar on Thursday.

Those measures are considered the least controversial in the legislative package and are meant to entice Republicans to vote for it.</p><h2 id="link-48924c56">Cutting education programs</h2><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The bill would slice $330 billion out of student loan spending over a decade. The biggest change would eliminate for new borrowers the Biden-era student loan repayment program known as SAVE — which ties loan payments to income and household size — as well as the Pay As You Earn plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan.</p><p>It would replace those with a single repayment plan that would be more costly for many students.</p><p>Total federal loan amounts would be capped by year and by program for graduate student loans, and new limits would be placed on how much parents can borrow to pay for their children’s tuition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The bill also would make it more difficult for part-time students to obtain Pell Grants, increasing the number of credits per semester required for the maximum award from 12 to 15, and requiring them to be enrolled at least half of the time to qualify at all. But it would allow Pell Grants to be used for shorter-term programs that earn students professional certifications.</p><h2 id="link-63154630">Raising the debt ceiling</h2><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The legislation would increase the nation’s statutory debt limit by about $4 trillion. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this month that the United States could run out of money to pay its bills by August if Congress does not raise or suspend the nation’s debt limit.</p><p>Many ultraconservative Republicans have long prided themselves on refusing to back any increase to the nation’s borrowing cap, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/us/politics/gop-spending-hawks-trump-debt.html" title="">refused to do so in December</a> even at Mr. Trump’s urging. But some have conceded they would rather raise the debt limit through the reconciliation bill — which allows them to pass legislation without a single Democratic vote — to deprive the minority party of any negotiating leverage.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Margot Sanger-Katz is a reporter covering health care policy and public health for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot">Upshot</a> section of The Times.</p></div><div><p>Andrew Duehren covers tax policy for The Times from Washington.</p></div><div><p>Brad Plumer is a Times reporter who covers technology and policy efforts to address global warming.</p></div><div><p>Tony Romm is a reporter covering economic policy and the Trump administration for The Times, based in Washington.</p></div><div><p>Catie Edmondson covers Congress for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Oversight of Local Police: </strong>Days before the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/trump-police-consent-decrees.html">the Trump administration said that it would abandon efforts to reduce police violence</a> there and in several other cities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Justice Dept.
