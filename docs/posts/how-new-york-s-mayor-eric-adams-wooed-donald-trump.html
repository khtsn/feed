Trump’s electoral victory alarmed most New York Democrats — but not Eric Adams. For Mr. Adams, the mayor of New York City who had been criminally indicted and faced political isolation, it was a golden opportunity.</p><p>In the weeks before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Adams cozied up to Mr. Trump, his political allies and his family.</p><p>The mayor called the president-elect on multiple occasions, congratulating him on his election victory and discussing city affairs. He met at a luxury Manhattan hotel with Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s ally and former top aide. And he contacted the president’s second son, Eric Trump, who runs the Trump family business.</p><p>The previously unreported extent of the charm campaign was recounted in interviews with more than a dozen people knowledgeable about the effort, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the nature of the communications.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The effort culminated in an in-person meeting of Mr. Adams and Mr. Trump in Florida just days before the inauguration.</p><p>While Mr. Adams did not explicitly raise his corruption case at the Florida meeting, the people said, Mr. Trump appeared sympathetic to the mayor’s legal plight. The president-elect, on the verge of attaining the power to make the mayor’s case disappear, lamented that the Justice Department under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was “weaponized.”</p><p>Mr. Adams has said that he was there on city business, and that his outreach to Mr. Trump was normal political bridge-building, irrelevant to his criminal case. A City Hall spokeswoman noted he was not the only Democrat who has sought to find some common ground with Mr. Trump.</p><p>“Mayor Adams wants to work with the new president, and not war with him, to better the lives of New Yorkers,” Liz Garcia, the City Hall spokeswoman, said in a statement. “There is no difference between how the mayor has approached his relationship with President Trump and how he approached his relationship with former President Biden. Any claim that he has anything but a professional relationship with President Trump is based in falsehood.”</p><p>Yet their in-person meeting sealed a connection between the two men and was a prelude to the mayor’s lawyers’ formal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/adams-lawyers-justice-department-dismissal.html" title="">request</a> to the Trump administration to abandon the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Less than a month<strong> </strong>after their meeting, Mr. Trump’s Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan to seek a dismissal of the indictment, arguing that it hindered Mr. Adams’s cooperation with the administration’s immigration crackdown. The department also claimed the corruption case would interfere in this year’s mayoral election. It left open the possibility of reviving the charges after November.</p><p>That striking move to drop the case — which prompted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/us/doj-resignations-trump-adams.html" title="">several Justice Department resignations</a> last month and a political crisis in New York — reflected a changed reality for the American justice system as the president has begun to demolish the wall between prosecution and politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/trump-adams301-lbzc/trump-adams301-lbzc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/trump-adams301-lbzc/trump-adams301-lbzc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/trump-adams301-lbzc/trump-adams301-lbzc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/trump-adams301-lbzc/trump-adams301-lbzc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/trump-adams301-lbzc/trump-adams301-lbzc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/trump-adams301-lbzc/trump-adams301-lbzc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/trump-adams301-lbzc/trump-adams301-lbzc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/32d09473-bed5-5fda-bb44-e9729b404ea5" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The move to dismiss the indictment prompted several Justice Department resignations and a political crisis in New York over the perception of a quid pro quo between the Trump and Adams administrations.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The mayor’s case offers a blueprint for fighting criminal charges in this new, transactional era: flatter Mr. Trump, forge a personal connection and, when possible, support his agenda.</p><p>Both sides stood to gain: Mr. Adams might well have secured his freedom, while Mr. Trump gained a friend in City Hall, someone to support elements of his immigration crackdown — and, potentially, his family business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That business, the Trump Organization, played a role in the mayor’s in-person meeting with Mr. Trump.</p><p>For one thing, the meeting was held at a Trump Organization property, a golf club in West Palm Beach, Fla. And it came about after Frank Carone, the mayor’s trusted outside adviser and former chief of staff, contacted Eric Trump, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The two men became acquainted when Mr. Carone was in City Hall in New York and the Trump Organization was operating a golf course on city land.</p><p>The Florida meeting also came as the Trump Organization was bidding on a New York City contract to operate a Central Park skating rink, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>There is no indication that the mayor’s office has advocated for the Trump Organization. But the situation is awkward nonetheless as the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation must evaluate a business owned by a family to which Mr. Adams is seemingly indebted.</p><p>Mr. Adams, his spokeswoman said, has not discussed the bid with the parks agency, which she said will follow its standard procedure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>She also disputed that Mr. Adams, who has offered mild pushback on some of the most polarizing Trump administration actions, was indebted to the president. The mayor, who has maintained his innocence, has said he never discussed his case with Mr. Trump, and has repeatedly denied that he promised anything in exchange for dropping it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eric Trump, who runs the Trump family business, helped to facilitate a meeting for Mr. Adams with his father.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump, who has played down the significance of the charges, has nonetheless denied having had anything to do with his Justice Department’s abandonment of the case.</p><p>For the president, any political gain from the case disappearing might be fleeting. The appearance of a backroom deal playing out in public has damaged the mayor’s re-election prospects, potentially limiting his usefulness to the president.</p><p>Moreover, the federal judge overseeing the case might not approve the Justice Department’s plan to revisit the charges after the mayoral race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Paul D. Clement, a prominent lawyer whom the judge tasked with offering an independent recommendation on the case, warned that the arrangement could give the impression that the Trump administration was threatening the mayor with the specter of a revived case.</p><p>It could create the appearance, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/doc-annotation-adams-clement-brief.html" title="">Mr. Clement wrote</a>, “that the actions of a public official are being driven by concerns about staying in the good graces of the federal executive, rather than the best interests of his constituents.”</p><p>The judge has already delayed Mr. Adams’s trial, once set for April. Mr. Clement recommended that the judge dismiss the case entirely.</p><h2 id="link-5b3e3d17">Building a Connection</h2></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Adams, appearing outside of the federal courthouse in Manhattan with his lawyer Alex Spiro in September, is the first New York City mayor in modern history to be indicted.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump, appearing at the state criminal court in Manhattan with his lawyer Todd Blanche last May, is the first president to have a felony conviction.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>In late October, a month after he was indicted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-fascist-mayor-adams.html" title="">the mayor</a> held a briefing for reporters ahead of Mr. Trump’s election rally at Madison Square Garden. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-fascist-mayor-adams.html" title="">was asked whether he agreed</a> with other Democrats who had called the former president a fascist.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Adams, <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/sitroom/date/2020-06-02/segment/01" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who a few years earlier had characterized Mr. Trump</a> as a “complete embarrassment to our nation,” leaned forward, his hands clasped in front of him. “My answer is no,” he said, adding, “I think we could all dial down the temperature.”</p><p>Mr. Trump soon won the election, and returned to New York, and the Garden, for a victory lap. This time, the event was an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout, where Mr. Adams approached the president-elect at his ringside seat, striking up a brief, friendly conversation.</p><p>Those episodes were early signs of compatibility between the two men. In subsequent months, they bonded over their views on immigration. Unlike other big city Democratic mayors, Mr. Adams has pledged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/adams-homan-meeting-migrants.html" title="">to work with the president</a> to target immigrants who have committed crimes, though local sanctuary laws have thus far prevented him from cooperating fully.</p><p>They also shared a sense of grievance against the justice system.</p><p>Last year, Mr. Trump became the first former and future president to be convicted of a crime and Mr. Adams became the first New York City mayor in modern history to be indicted.</p><p>Mr. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records related to a sex scandal. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan accused Mr. Adams of soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations and accepting thousands of dollars’ worth of travel benefits in exchange for helping Turkish officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-indictment-takeaways.html" title="">open a new consulate building.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>After Mr. Trump’s electoral victory, Mr. Adams began calling him, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. In an initial call, he congratulated Mr. Trump on his election victory and on subsequent calls discussed city business, though the people declined to elaborate on the business that was discussed. Mr. Adams did not raise his case on the calls, the people said.</p><p>In December, as their connection strengthened, Mr. Trump told reporters he would consider pardoning Mr. Adams, contending that the mayor had been treated “pretty unfairly” by federal prosecutors.</p><p>Asked about the president-elect’s comments at the time, Mr. Adams deferred to his legal team, saying, “I have an attorney that is going to look at every avenue to ensure I get justice.”</p><p>Soon after, Mr. Adams’s defense team learned of a troubling development. According to court filings, a “credible source” on Dec. 22 told Mr. Adams’s lawyer Alex Spiro that a grand jury was hearing testimony related to a potential new charge.</p><p>Around this time, Mr. Adams appears to have stepped up his outreach to Mr. Trump’s circle of supporters. That included turning to Mr. Bannon — a hard-right provocateur who was hardly a natural touch point for a Democratic mayor. But Mr. Bannon, too, once faced charges brought by the Manhattan federal prosecutors’ office, and he had been represented by Mr. Spiro in other matters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Weeks before the inauguration, after Mr. Spiro helped to connect them, the mayor met with Mr. Bannon at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue, according to people with knowledge of the encounter. Mr. Adams did not mention his case, one of the people said, but they discussed a potential mayoral primary against former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stephen K.
