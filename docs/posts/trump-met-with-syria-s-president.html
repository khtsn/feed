Just before a summit of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia, President Ahmed al-Shara and President Trump spoke for about half an hour, and Trump told al-Shara that the Syrian president had “a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,” according to a summary of the meeting.</p><p>The encounter was a stunning turnaround for al-Shara, an ex-militant who led the rebel alliance that ousted Bashar al-Assad, and who once was at the helm of a Qaeda branch before moderating his image. Aboard Air Force One on his way to Qatar, Trump described al-Shara as a “young, attractive guy.”</p><p>“Tough guy,” he said. “Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.”</p><p>On the second day of his four-day visit to the Gulf region, Trump also met with the emir of Qatar in Doha, the country’s capital. There, he announced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/qatar-airways-boeing-jets.html?smid=url-share" title="">Qatar Airways had agreed to buy 210 Boeing jets</a>. The countries also signed a statement of defense cooperation that included a $1 billion agreement with Raytheon for Qatar to acquire counter-drone capabilities, and a nearly $2 billion agreement with General Atomics for a remotely piloted aircraft system.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A hospital in the town of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-123b266b">Israel tried to kill Yahya Sinwar’s brother</h2><p>Muhammad Sinwar, the younger brother of an architect of the Oct. 7 attacks, Yahya Sinwar, is considered one of Hamas’s top military commanders in Gaza.

For a group of podiatrists in Melbourne, Australia, it inspired curiosity about Barbie dolls and how their feet were linked to empowerment.</p><p>For a study, they examined the feet of 2,750 dolls produced from 1959 to 2024. In the early decades of Barbie’s life, 100 percent of the dolls had arched feet. In the last four years, only 40 percent did. “Employed” dolls were far more likely to have flat feet. In a statement, Mattel confirmed that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/style/barbie-high-heels-feet-study.html" title="">foot design was a deliberate part of Barbie’s evolution</a>.</p><p>Have a liberated evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
