His siblings chose to stay. None of them escaped the horrors of one of the deadliest Israeli campaigns in northern Gaza since the yearlong war began.</p><p>When Israel started its latest operation in early October to root out Hamas militants in the north of the Gaza Strip, the Nasr family were among some 400,000 people estimated by the United Nations to remain. They faced a near-impossible choice.</p><p>Staying put has meant enduring devastating bombardment. Hospitals are filled with the dead and wounded. Bodies have been left for weeks beneath the rubble. And it has meant hunger: <a href="https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20241014_international_community_will_be_complicit_if_israel_forcibly_transfers_the_population_of_northern_gaza" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rights groups say</a> Israel has imposed restrictions on aid so harsh they could amount to a starvation tactic.</p><p>But leaving has brought its own perils. Many civilians now believe that fleeing on the orders of Israeli forces is just as deadly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>When Ramy Nasr, 44, received an automated voice message from the Israeli army on Oct. 6 declaring most of northern Gaza an evacuation zone, including his hometown, Jabaliya, he took the warning to heart. His 17-year-old daughter, Mira, had already been severely injured by a strike in December, he told The New York Times.</p><p>A day after he received the message, Mr. Nasr followed one of the many orders Israel has issued in the past weeks — orders so numerous that its main ally, the United States, warned they <a href="https://usun.usmission.gov/remarks-by-ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfield-at-a-un-security-council-briefing-on-the-situation-in-the-middle-east-30/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">risk violating</a> international law.</p><p>Yet Mr. Nasr, like many of his neighbors, said he feared using the route Israeli forces had designated. To reach it, he would have had to trek a mile on foot across active combat zones inside the city. On top of that, he said, Israeli tanks and soldiers were positioned along the evacuation road, which made him wary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A bald man with a trim beard next to two young girls, one in a pink blouse and dungarees with a toy bunny on them." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 979w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1200w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7132f5e9-61b2-5aac-b4e1-d0e50d58dd25" decoding="async" width="600" height="628"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ramy Nasr and two of his daughters, Lamar, left, and Dana, about a month before the war started.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Instead of following the army route, Mr. Nasr decided on a shorter one that would allow his family to flee to safety more directly, through an intersection called Abu Sharkh.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The decision was almost fatal.</p><p>In a video filmed by a resident who had crossed ahead of Mr. Nasr, and which has been verified by The New York Times, a group of people fleeing rush up the road — among them, Mr. Nasr and his family. Suddenly a volley of gunfire and screaming erupts. Mr. Nasr is later seen being loaded onto a truck, his knee bleeding from a gunshot wound. His 9-year-old daughter, Dana, blinks silently in shock as someone presses a white bandage around her neck to stanch a stream of blood running down her checkered pink T-shirt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/ramy/ramy-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Video by a resident of Jabaliya shows Ramy Nasr and his daughter Dana, both wounded, being helped out of the Abu Sharkh intersection.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mohammed Sultan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“If we knew we were going to be shot at, we wouldn’t have crossed,” said Mr. Nasr, who confirmed that the video showed him and his family. Residents have taken to calling the Abu Sharkh intersection a “crossing of death.”</p><p>The Times spoke to five residents who witnessed gunfire as people tried to cross the intersection, and reviewed more than 80 videos and photographs from Oct. 7 to Oct. 9 showing families, including children and the elderly, hurriedly carrying their belongings amid sporadic shooting. It was not possible to verify the source of the shooting.</p><p>The Israeli army did not address detailed questions from The Times about the shooting of civilians at the Abu Sharkh crossing — or how residents could have left the town more safely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In a briefing for journalists last week, an Israeli official said the army had encouraged and facilitated the safe passage of Palestinians out of Jabaliya. The official, who declined to be named to discuss military details, said that roughly 50,000 people had left Jabaliya during that process, leaving about 10,000 inside.</p><p>Israel has accused Hamas of shooting at civilians fleeing northern Gaza, or blocking them from leaving, but Gazans fleeing — among them Mr. Nasr — blame Israeli forces for such shootings. The New York Times could not verify either assertion.</p><p>When Mr. Nasr told his three siblings who planned to follow him what had happened, his older brother Ammar, who was partially blind, feared he would not survive a similar ordeal. Ammar and two other Nasr siblings decided they were better off staying in the building where they had long lived with their families.</p><p>“Their fear of leaving ended up getting them killed,” Mr. Nasr said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-11"><div><figcaption><span>The blast killed six members of the Nasr family, including Ramy Nasr’s brothers (top row) Arif Adel Nasr and Ammar Nasr, and his sister, Ola Adel Nasr, as well as Ammar Nasr’s wife (bottom row), Ibtisam Mohammed Ahmed Bahja, and their two daughters, Samma and Lama Ammar Adel Nasr.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>On Oct. 9, Israeli forces twice called the Nasr residence, ordering the family to evacuate. The Nasrs asked for assurances that they could make the crossing safely, explaining that Ammar had vision problems. The soldiers refused.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>So the family decided instead to shelter in a building across the alley. Hours later, the building collapsed in a blast. Ammar, his wife and two children were all killed, along with another of Mr. Nasr’s brothers, Arif, and his sister, Ola.</p><p>The story of their final hours was recounted to The Times by the sole survivor of the blast, a neighbor named Mohammed Shouha. He had decided to shelter with the Nasr family after his sister was shot dead while trying to make the same crossing as Ramy Nasr.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-15"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/world/middleeast/north-gaza/north-gaza-superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In footage captured by a Gaza-based photographer, a group of men carry Naema Shouha, the sister of Mohammed Shouha, while another group runs across the Abu Sharkh intersection as gunfire echoes in the background.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Abood Abusalama</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The Israeli military declined to offer The Times a specific response to the Nasr family’s story. It said that Hamas had a “documented practice of operating from, nearby, underneath and within densely populated areas,” adding that its own strikes on military targets “are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions and after an assessment that the expected incidental damage to civilians and civilian property is not excessive in relation to the expected military advantage from the attack.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>In satellite imagery taken on Oct. 11, several buildings near the Nasr family home appear badly damaged and destroyed, including the one where Mr. Shouha said they had taken shelter. The Times mapped the buildings’ exact location, matching them to the ruins seen in a verified video two days later. Mr. Nasr’s home appears in the video, showing extensive destruction, with blackened, glassless windows, although it was still standing.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-19"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="gazanorthclose-c2ogd" data-id="100000009796059" data-source-id="100000009796059"><div slug="gazanorthclose-c2ogd" data-sourceid="100000009796059" id="embed-id-100000009796059">

Whatever they choose — fleeing or staying — they face a military campaign so ferocious that Gazans, rights groups and some regional experts have condemned it as an intentional effort to depopulate the north.</p><p>“We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,” Volker Türk, the United Nations human rights chief, said. “The Israeli government’s policies and practices in northern Gaza risk emptying the area of all Palestinians.”</p><p>In the past two weeks, two major strikes have killed dozens of people, many of them young children, according to Gazan health officials.

Recovering the wounded and the dead is now so perilous, many residents and medics say they are often forced to simply leave bodies in the street.</p><p>“Whatever moves in the street is shot,” Fatima Hussein, a local journalist who has remained in Jabaliya, told The Times. “There are so many martyrs that medics haven’t been able to reach — they are lying in the streets. Some decompose, others are eaten by cats and dogs. All of northern Gaza is death now.”</p><p>Many Gazans have taken to sheltering in school buildings. But there, too, they run the risk of strikes by the Israeli military, which says that Hamas militants use the schools for their operations. Accounts from some residents in central Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/world/middleeast/airstrikes-gaza-school-shelters-hamas.html" title="">suggest</a> that at least some evacuees have blocked armed militias from moving into these shelters.</p><p>For Mr. Nasr, escape from his besieged town has not diminished the sense of suffering.
