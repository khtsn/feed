His 17-year-old daughter, Mira, had already been severely injured by a strike in December, he told The New York Times.</p><p>A day after he received the message, Mr. Nasr followed one of the many orders Israel has issued in the past weeks — orders so numerous that its main ally, the United States, warned they <a href="https://usun.usmission.gov/remarks-by-ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfield-at-a-un-security-council-briefing-on-the-situation-in-the-middle-east-30/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">risk violating</a> international law.</p><p>Yet Mr. Nasr, like many of his neighbors, said he feared using the route Israeli forces had designated. To reach it, he would have had to trek a mile on foot across active combat zones inside the city. On top of that, he said, Israeli tanks and soldiers were positioned along the evacuation road, which made him wary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A bald man with a trim beard next to two young girls, one in a pink blouse and dungarees with a toy bunny on them." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 979w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/arts/00gaza-north-1/00gaza-north-1-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1200w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7132f5e9-61b2-5aac-b4e1-d0e50d58dd25" decoding="async" width="600" height="628"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ramy Nasr and two of his daughters, Lamar, left, and Dana, about a month before the war started.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Instead of following the army route, Mr. Nasr decided on a shorter one that would allow his family to flee to safety more directly, through an intersection called Abu Sharkh.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The decision was almost fatal.</p><p>In a video filmed by a resident who had crossed ahead of Mr. Nasr, and which has been verified by The New York Times, a group of people fleeing rush up the road — among them, Mr. Nasr and his family.
