But those winds had softened by late Thursday and were predicted to slow even more by Friday afternoon. Breezes from the Pacific Ocean were also expected to add some much-needed moisture to the air.</p><p>“There is some concern for fire going the other way because of this, but the wind should be relatively light, and it is going to bring more moisture since it’s coming from the ocean,” Bryan Lewis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said on Friday.</p><p>The fire, which broke out on Wednesday, has torn through more than 20,000 acres, burned numerous homes and forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By Friday morning, it was only 7 percent contained, fire officials said.</p><p>Ground crews and helicopters focused their containment efforts near the communities of Santa Paula and Somis.

The community, which is about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, is home to many retirees and scenic wedding venues.</p><p>Linda Fefferman and her husband, Dennis Gottlieb, were sheltering at the church after evacuating from the home they had rented from a friend. They barely made it out: The fire felled a tree and blocked the road as they tried to leave the neighborhood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We figured we were trapped,” said Ms. Fefferman, 74. “Thankfully, one of the neighbors had a chain saw.”</p><p>Their home was not spared. The couple lost their two pet birds, decades of family genealogy records and supplies for Mr. Gottlieb’s pest control business. “He’s got his truck, but everything else is gone,” Ms. Fefferman said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The couple does not have renter’s insurance. They plan to stay at the shelter until they sort things out. They have no family nearby, and nowhere else to go, Ms. Fefferman said. “Eventually, I’ll break down, I’m sure.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The region threatened by the fire includes rural communities with nurseries, farms and horse ranches. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noah Berger/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

But at least eight homes appeared untouched, their lawns green and porches intact.</p><p>Smoke and ash wafted throughout the air as firefighters tended to remaining hot spots.</p><p>The region threatened by the fire includes rural communities dotted with nurseries, farms and horse ranches. Wildfires are not uncommon there, but residents said they were unprepared for how swiftly the blaze progressed.</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom of California visited the area on Thursday and noted that the fire continued to destroy critical infrastructure before proclaiming a state of emergency, which will help local officials obtain resources more quickly. He had previously said in a statement that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would provide quick financial assistance, and urged residents to be ready to evacuate when officials told them to leave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-20"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2022-wildfire-embed-embed-mountain_ventura_ca" data-id="100000009812926" data-source-id="100000009812926"><div slug="2022-wildfire-embed-embed-mountain_ventura_ca" data-sourceid="100000009812926" id="embed-id-100000009812926">
