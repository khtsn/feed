The flames burned numerous homes, forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate and prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom of California to declare a state of emergency.</p><p>The blaze, known as the Mountain fire, broke out in Ventura County on Wednesday morning and had grown to more than 20,000 acres. By Thursday evening, the wildfire had destroyed over 130 structures and damaged nearly 90 others, and it was only 5 percent contained, fire officials said.</p><p>Ground crews and helicopters focused their containment efforts near the communities of Santa Paula and Somis. At least 800 firefighters were battling the blaze on Thursday, with more expected. Many schools in the area were closed, and officials urged residents to stay away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07nat-california-fire-hlbq/07nat-california-fire-hlbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07nat-california-fire-hlbq/07nat-california-fire-hlbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07nat-california-fire-hlbq/07nat-california-fire-hlbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Smoldering homes amid pine trees in the hills." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07nat-california-fire-hlbq/07nat-california-fire-hlbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07nat-california-fire-hlbq/07nat-california-fire-hlbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07nat-california-fire-hlbq/07nat-california-fire-hlbq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07nat-california-fire-hlbq/07nat-california-fire-hlbq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9a218fa1-0076-504a-8a5b-b6cf657babc4" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fueled by fierce winds and low moisture, the Mountain fire burned numerous homes and forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ethan Swope/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firefighters struggled over steep terrain to battle the fast-moving fire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Etienne Laurent/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At least 800 firefighters were battling the blaze, with more expected.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Allison Dinner/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The fire there is in a tricky place — it’s rugged, steep ground that only our finest firefighters can even access,” said Capt. Trevor Johnson of the Ventura County Fire Department. “We’re going to work as best as we can.”</p><p>Dozens of evacuees spent the night at Padre Serra Parish, a Catholic church in the town of Camarillo. The community, which is about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, is home to many retirees and scenic wedding venues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Linda Fefferman and her husband, Dennis Gottlieb, were sheltering at the church after evacuating from the home they had rented from a friend.

The couple lost their two pet birds, decades of family genealogy records and supplies for Mr. Gottlieb’s pest control business. “He’s got his truck, but everything else is gone,” Ms. Fefferman said.</p><p>The couple does not have renter’s insurance. They plan to stay at the shelter until they sort things out. They have no family nearby, and nowhere else to go, Ms. Fefferman said. “Eventually, I’ll break down, I’m sure.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The region threatened by the fire includes rural communities with nurseries, farms and horse ranches. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noah Berger/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

Conditions were expected to improve even more by Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The region threatened by the fire includes rural communities dotted with nurseries, farms and horse ranches. Wildfires are not uncommon there, but residents said they were unprepared for how swiftly the blaze progressed.</p><p>Governor Newsom visited the area on Thursday and noted that the fire continued to destroy critical infrastructure before proclaiming a state of emergency, which will help local officials obtain resources more quickly. He had previously said in a statement that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would provide quick financial assistance, and urged residents to be ready to evacuate when officials told them to leave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-17"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2022-wildfire-embed-embed-mountain_ventura_ca" data-id="100000009812926" data-source-id="100000009812926"><div slug="2022-wildfire-embed-embed-mountain_ventura_ca" data-sourceid="100000009812926" id="embed-id-100000009812926">

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p><p>The blaze caught residents off guard. Ethan Bates, 26, left the Camarillo home he shares with his mother early Wednesday to golf with a friend 30 miles away. When he returned at about 10:30 a.m., his neighborhood was unrecognizable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It was a total nightmare — it was a giant black cloud of smoke in the air,” Mr. Bates said. He grabbed his passport and golden retriever, Butter, before leaving with his mother.</p><p>His mother’s boyfriend stayed behind and used a generator to power a water pump so he could hose down the house and surrounding bushes. He sent photos showing the front lawn on fire and palm trees up in flames.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Bates managed to return to his home, which was still standing. But the yard had been scorched and his neighbor’s tractor had been completely burned.</p><p>“I honestly believe if her boyfriend didn’t stay, the house would be gone,” he said of his mother’s partner.</p><p>Jin Yu Young<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
