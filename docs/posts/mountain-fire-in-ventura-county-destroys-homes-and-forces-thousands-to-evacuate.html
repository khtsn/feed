The flames burned numerous homes, forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate and prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom of California to declare a state of emergency.</p><p>The blaze, known as the Mountain fire, broke out in Ventura County on Wednesday morning and had grown to more than 20,000 acres. By Thursday evening, the wildfire had destroyed over 130 structures and damaged nearly 90 others, and it was only 5 percent contained, fire officials said.</p><p>Ground crews and helicopters focused their containment efforts near the communities of Santa Paula and Somis. At least 800 firefighters were battling the blaze on Thursday, with more expected.
