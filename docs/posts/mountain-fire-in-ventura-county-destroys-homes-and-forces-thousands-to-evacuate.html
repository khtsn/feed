Fueled by fierce winds and a lack of moisture, the flames burned through numerous homes, injured at least two people and forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate.</p><p>The blaze, known as the Mountain fire, broke out in Ventura County on Wednesday morning and had grown to more than 19,000 acres by Thursday afternoon. The wildfire threatened 3,500 structures, and was still zero percent contained, fire officials said. They planned to send out teams to determine how many homes had been damaged or destroyed.</p><p>Ground crews and helicopters focused their containment efforts near the communities of Santa Paula and Somis. At least 800 firefighters were battling the blaze on Thursday, with more expected. Many schools in the area were closed, and officials urged residents to stay away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fueled by fierce winds and low moisture, the Mountain fire burned numerous homes, injured at least two people and forced more than 10,000 more to evacuate.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ethan Swope/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firefighters struggled over steep terrain to battle the fast-moving fire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Etienne Laurent/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At least 800 firefighters were battling the blaze, with more expected.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Allison Dinner/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The fire there is in a tricky place — it’s rugged, steep ground that only our finest firefighters can even access,” said Capt. Trevor Johnson of the Ventura County Fire Department. “We’re going to work as best as we can.”</p><p>Dozens of evacuees spent the night at Padre Serra Parish, a Catholic church in the town of Camarillo.

The couple lost their two pet birds, decades of family genealogy records and supplies for Mr. Gottlieb’s pest control business. “He’s got his truck, but everything else is gone,” Ms. Fefferman said.</p><p>The couple does not have renter’s insurance. They plan to stay at the shelter until they sort things out. They have no family nearby, and nowhere else to go, Ms. Fefferman said. “Eventually, I’ll break down, I’m sure.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The region threatened by the fire includes rural communities with nurseries, farms and horse ranches. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noah Berger/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

He did not know their condition. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p><p>The blaze had caught residents off guard. Ethan Bates, 26, left the Camarillo home he shares with his mother early Wednesday to golf with a friend 30 miles away. When he returned at about 10:30 a.m., his neighborhood was unrecognizable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It was a total nightmare — it was a giant black cloud of smoke in the air,” Mr. Bates said. He grabbed his passport and golden retriever, Butter, before leaving with his mother.</p><p>His mother’s boyfriend stayed behind and used a generator to power a water pump so he could hose down the house and surrounding bushes. He sent photos showing the front lawn on fire and palm trees up in flames.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Bates managed to return to his home, which was still standing. But the yard had been scorched and his neighbor’s tractor had been completely burned.</p><p>“I honestly believe if her boyfriend didn’t stay, the house would be gone,” he said of his mother’s partner.</p><p>As officials continued to warn about the area’s strong winds, two other fires broke out on Thursday in Southern California. In Santa Barbara County, local officials quickly ordered mandatory evacuations for an area that included a high school in the city of Lompoc.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“NO time to pack, please leave NOW,” officials with the county Fire Department wrote on X.</p><p>Known as the Santa Lucia fire, it started at about 1 p.m. not far from the Vandenberg Space Force Base.</p><p>Around the same time, Los Angeles County firefighters were responding to a fire deep in the Angeles National Forest about 10 miles north of Castaic, an unincorporated community.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
