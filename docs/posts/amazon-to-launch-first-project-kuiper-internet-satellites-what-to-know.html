The market for beaming high-speed internet to the ground from orbit is currently dominated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket company, which operates a similar service, Starlink. Starlink, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/28/business/starlink.html" title="">with thousands of satellites in orbit</a> and more launching nearly every week, already serves several million customers around the world.</p><p>The first attempt to send the satellites to orbit, on April 9, was postponed because of poor weather at the launch site. On Monday, the company is ready to try again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-650d19b5">When the launch and how can I watch it?</h2><p>The first 27 Project Kuiper satellites are scheduled to lift off on Monday between 7 and 9 p.m. Eastern time from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. They will fly on an Atlas V, a rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.</p><p>U.L.A. plans to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nwyv0fPgmc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provide live coverage</a> beginning at 6:35 p.m. The company says that weather conditions are currently 70 percent favorable for an on-time launch.</p><p>The spacecraft will deploy the Kuiper satellites in a circular orbit at 280 miles above the surface. The satellites’ propulsion system will then gradually raise that orbit to an altitude of 393 miles.</p><h2 id="link-3005cc0e">What is Project Kuiper?</h2><p>Project Kuiper will be a constellation of internet satellites intended to provide high-speed data connections to almost every point on Earth. Doing this successfully will require thousands of satellites, and Amazon’s goal is to operate more than 3,200 in the years to come.</p><p>The company will compete with SpaceX’s Starlink, a service that was originally marketed primarily to residential customers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While Kuiper also aims for that market, particularly in remote areas, it will also be integrated with Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing offering, which is popular with large corporations and governments around the world. That might make it more attractive to businesses that involve satellite imagery or weather forecasting that not only need to move large amounts of data across the internet, but also to perform calculations on the data.</p><p>Ground stations will connect the Kuiper satellites to the web services infrastructure in a manner that could also allow companies to communicate with their own remote equipment. For example, Amazon has suggested that energy companies could use Kuiper to monitor and control remote wind farms or offshore drilling platforms.</p><p>In October 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/science/amazon-project-kuiper-launch.html" title="">two prototype Kuiper satellites</a> were launched to test the technology. Amazon said that the tests were successful. Those prototypes were never meant to serve in the operational constellation, and after seven months they were nudged back into the atmosphere, where they burned up. The company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-satellite-internet-first-launch" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it has since updated the designs of “every system and subsystem on board.”</p><p>“There’s a big difference between launching two satellites and launching 3,000 satellites,” said Rajeev Badyal, an Amazon executive in charge of Kuiper, in a promotional video ahead of the launch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Project Kuiper’s satellites contained within an Atlas V rocket fairing at Amazon’s satellite processing facility at Cape Canaveral last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amazon, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-208edd9e">When will Amazon provide internet service from space?</h2><p>Amazon told the Federal Communications Commission in 2020 that service would begin after it had deployed its first 578 satellites. The company has said that it expects to connect customers to the internet later this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>While a fully functional constellation needs thousands of satellites, the company can offer service in specific regions with far fewer in orbit before expanding to more global coverage later on.</p><p>The F.C.C.’s approval of the constellation came with a requirement that at least half the satellites needed to be deployed by July 30, 2026. Industry analysts say the company could get an extension if it has demonstrated substantial progress by then.</p><p>Getting the satellites into orbit also depends on rocket launches occurring on schedule, which can be a problem if enough rockets are not available. Amazon also needs to build hundreds of ground stations, to relay their signals to users.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karen Weise writes about technology and is based in Seattle.
