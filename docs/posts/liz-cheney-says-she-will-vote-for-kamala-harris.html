    <h1>Liz Cheney Says She Will Vote for Kamala Harris</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former Representative Liz Cheney, the onetime high-ranking Republican from Wyoming who torpedoed her own political career by breaking vociferously with former President Donald J. Trump, on Wednesday told students at a Duke University event that she would be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris in November.</p><p>“I don’t believe we have the luxury of writing in candidates’ names, particularly in swing states,” Ms. Cheney said. “As a conservative and someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.”</p><p>Ms. Cheney had remained silent until now, despite repeated outreach from the Harris campaign, which has been courting Republican endorsements and voters. Ms. Cheney chose not to speak at the Democratic National Convention, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/us/politics/liz-cheney-kamala-harris-endorsement.html" title="">making the decision to wait for</a> a stand-alone moment in September, closer to when early voting was set to begin.</p><p>It was a strategic choice to ensure her voice would not be lost in a sea of back-to-back convention speeches, according to three people familiar with her thinking.</p></div></div>
