She modeled clothing and posed in bikinis on the beach. She gallivanted around Europe with friends.</p><p>Within a year, she was an influencer in full, with more than 450,000 followers.</p><p>But her content took a sharp turn in August 2023. In a pink bikini top, her face stained with tears, she spoke directly to the camera. “I have cancer,” she said. “I am strong, so I’ll be good.” She flashed a thumbs-up and an awkward smile.</p><p>Her diagnosis, she said, was cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive cancer of the bile ducts.</p><p>Ms. Towle’s social media posts grew more frequent and personal, as she joined the ranks of influencers in what is known as CancerTok. She made videos of herself exploring New York City, where she said she had moved to be close to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; struggling with exhaustion and nausea she attributed to chemotherapy; and crying in grief for the carefree life she no longer led. And her growing online fan base — before long, she had more than 760,000 followers — routinely cheered her on:</p><p>“We are all rooting hard for you girl!!!” one person posted on TikTok. “Keep up the good fight.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Your positive outlook through all of this inspires me daily,” another said.</p><p>But on Reddit, in a more skeptical and caustic corner of the internet, an army of angry critics was assembling.</p><p>“I literally feel like punching her in the face,” wrote one commenter.</p><p>Ms. Towle’s antagonists had quickly concluded that she was leveraging her story of illness for public sympathy and financial benefit. They scrutinized her every word and image, building a case that she was misleading the public.</p><p>Many accused her of faking cancer altogether.</p><p>Ms. Towle, 25, is now at the center of an intense social media collision that reveals the best intentions and worst instincts of the internet — where isolated strangers can become support systems in times of crisis and sleuths labor obsessively to root out scammers.</p><p>But in an online economy that feeds off emotion and internet addiction, it’s not always clear who is manipulating whom.</p><h2 id="link-4cdbfc1">‘No defending Syd’</h2><p>In mid-March, Ms. Towle posted a video in which she appears to be at a chemotherapy appointment. She is pictured next to an IV pole, vomit bag in hand, bopping to the beat of “Nokia” by Drake.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Several days later, she posted another video, this time inviting her followers along on an adventure. “This is us before going scuba diving in the ocean — for the first time,” she says, standing next to her brother, Austin, against a bright blue sky and the Caribbean Sea. In the next scene, they’re wearing wet suits. “This is us, after our first dive.” They were in Jamaica for a friend’s wedding.</p><p>On Reddit, Ms. Towle’s critics saw the stark juxtaposition as evidence that she was not, in fact, sick.</p><p>“Syd must WANT to be outed,” one person wrote.</p><p>“Don’t worry, she’ll be back with the fake nausea and baby voice in no time,” another responded.</p><p>“Snark pages” on Reddit, also known as “snark subreddits,” are designated forums where people congregate under the veil of anonymity to critique and mock influencers and celebrities. In some cases, they become skeptical of the influencers they follow and fixated on exposing inconsistencies in their narratives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>A snark page devoted to Sydney Towle appeared last fall, just as she was moving to Manhattan.
