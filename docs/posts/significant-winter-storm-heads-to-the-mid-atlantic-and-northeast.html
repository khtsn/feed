The heaviest snowfall is expected north and west of the Interstate 95 corridor, with up to eight inches possible, according to the <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Weather Service</a>.</p><p>Areas from northern Maryland to Boston could get three to six inches of snow, with some spots potentially getting more. Northern Virginia to southern New Jersey may get a mix of rain and snow.</p><p>Much of the Northeast is under winter storm warnings or winter weather advisories. A winter storm warning is issued when severe winter weather is expected or already occurring, and could make travel extremely dangerous or even impossible. An advisory is for less severe conditions that are expected to cause inconveniences and still require caution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The New York City metropolitan area, Long Island, southern Westchester and coastal Connecticut are under winter weather advisories until 4 a.m. on Monday. Snowfall accumulations of three to five inches are expected, which may lead to slippery travel and snow-covered roads through Sunday afternoon and night. There were some flight disruptions <a href="https://x.com/LGAairport/status/1881008762443407815" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at LaGuardia Airport</a> on Sunday.</p><p>Forecasters at the New York office of the Weather Service warned that snowfall rates could be up to one inch per hour at times. Inland areas of New York, such as the Lower Hudson Valley, may get up to eight inches of snow.</p><p>Immediately after the storm clears out early on Monday, arctic air will plunge across most of the south-central and southeastern parts of the United States, bringing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/weather/weather-us-cold-forecast.html" title="">several days of frigid conditions</a>.</p><p>This is the coldest air of the winter season so far, and in many cases the coldest in several years, forecasters from the National Weather Service warned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The high temperatures will be from below zero to single digits in the Northern Plains and the Upper Midwest; single digits and teens across the Rockies, the central Plains and the Midwest; the teens and 20s across the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic; and between the 20s and 30s in Texas and the Southeast.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Weather Service said wind chills would be at dangerously low levels and hypothermia or frostbite could occur with prolonged exposure or lack of proper clothing.</p><p>Wind chills from 30 to 55 degrees below zero are expected at times on Monday in the Rockies, the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest, and subzero as far south as Oklahoma and the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Forecasters warned of a significant winter storm across the Gulf Coast states coming Monday, as a combination of frigid air and a storm system over the Gulf is expected to bring snow, freezing rain and ice to the region.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Weather Service warned that the rare southerly track of this winter storm could lead to major travel disruptions from Monday night to Wednesday.Areas from eastern Texas to the Carolinas are likely to be affected.</p><p>Heavy snow is forecast near and just south of the Interstate 20 corridor, while areas closer to Interstate 10 may get a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain continuing into Tuesday.</p><p>As the storm moves eastward from Texas, it is forecast to sweep across Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and the Carolinas.</p><p>The National Weather Service has issued <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lch" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">winter storm watches</a> for portions of Louisiana. The most snowfall is likely to be between the U.S. 190 and Interstate 10 corridors of Louisiana and southeast Texas, where four to six inches may accumulate. Farther north and south of this, three to four inches are expected.</p><p>By Tuesday night, the storm is expected to reach the Atlantic coast, bringing icy or wintry weather farther north.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Forecasters are monitoring the potential for wintry conditions in parts of northern Florida and southern Georgia. Though the stormâ€™s exact path remains uncertain, freezing rain is the most likely outcome for these areas.</p><p>Amanda Holpuch<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
