    <h1>State Dept. Tells Congress It Plans to Send $8 Billion in Arms to Israel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the informal notification period, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee are expected to review the proposed sales and ask questions of the State Department. They can hold up the transfers if they have doubts. The top Democrats on both committees have been more skeptical of arms transfers to Israel, while the top Republicans have quickly granted approval.</p><p>Once the four top members grant approval to the State Department, the agency would give formal notification to Congress, which essentially means the proposed sales will go through. Congress would need a two-thirds vote in each house to pass a resolution blocking the sales.</p><p>The informal notification was reported earlier by <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/04/biden-arms-deal-israel-8-billion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Axios</a>.</p><p>Weapons transfers to Israel have been a contentious issue that has dogged Mr. Biden among liberals. In the presidential election in November, some progressive voters and some Muslim American voters said they could not bring themselves to back Mr. Biden because of his steadfast support of Israel.</p><p>The Israeli military, supplied with U.S. weapons, has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, including many civilians, during the war, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Critics of Israelâ€™s conduct of the war have beseeched Mr. Biden to withhold weapons aid to Israel to pressure it to curb its military operations, which have demolished most of Gaza.</p><p>Mr. Biden and his top aides, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/us/politics/biden-israel-gaza-war-democrats.html" title="">tried to walk a fine line</a>, sometimes criticizing Israeli actions even as they have said Israel has the right to defend itself. At one point, Mr. Biden said he was withholding a single shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel to try to dissuade it from destroying Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, but the Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/world/middleeast/rafah-israel-offensive-images.html" title="">reduced most of Rafah to rubble</a> anyway.</p></div></div>
