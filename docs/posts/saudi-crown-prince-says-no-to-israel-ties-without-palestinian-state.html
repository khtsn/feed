    <h1>Saudi Crown Prince Says No to Israel Ties Without Palestinian State</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has declared that the kingdom will not <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/27/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-israel-netanyahu-west-bank.html" title="">establish diplomatic relations with Israel</a> before the “establishment of a Palestinian state,” an apparent hardening of his position on an issue that could reshape the diplomatic map of the Middle East.</p><p>“The kingdom will not cease its tireless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without one,” the crown prince and the kingdom’s de facto ruler said on Wednesday in an address to a senior advisory council. “We thank all the countries that recognized the Palestinian state as an embodiment of international legitimacy, and we urge other countries to take similar steps.”</p><p>For decades, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, like those of most other Arab countries, refused to recognize Israel without the creation of a state for the Palestinians. But after 2020, when four Arab states <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/world/middleeast/israel-bahrain-mideast-persian-gulf.html" title="">established formal ties with Israel</a> in agreements brokered by then-President Donald J. Trump, Prince Mohammed became the first Saudi leader to talk openly about the possibility of Saudi Arabia doing the same.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News last September, he called a potential agreement “the biggest historical deal since the end of the Cold War” and said it would require “a good life for the Palestinians” but did not mention Palestinian statehood.</p><p>His statement on Wednesday followed a general hardening of official Saudi rhetoric toward Israel since the start of the Gaza war in October.</p><p>“We renew the kingdom’s rejection and strong condemnation of the crimes of the Israeli occupation authority against the Palestinian people,” Prince Mohammed said, delivering remarks on behalf of his father.</p><p>The crown prince’s statement came nearly a month after President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority visited him in Riyadh.</p><p>Until Hamas sparked the Gaza war with a devastating attack on Israel on Oct. 7, both Israeli and Saudi officials <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/gulf-news/saudi-arabia/2023/10/02/second-israeli-minister-heads-to-saudi-arabia-amid-normalisation-talks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had been indicating</a> they were moving toward a deal.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has been seeking security guarantees, including a defense pact with the United States and assistance with a civilian nuclear program as part of any agreement. During the Fox News interview, Prince Mohammed stated that Riyadh was “getting closer” to an accord.</p><p>However, since the Gaza war broke out, Saudi Arabia has insisted on the need for an “<a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2024/04/30/arab-european-ministers-call-for-irreversible-two-state-solution-to-palestine-conflict/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">irreversible track</a>” to Palestinian statehood.</p><p>This month, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said he still hoped to finalize an Israeli-Saudi deal before the end of President Biden’s term. “I think if we can get a cease-fire in Gaza, there remains an opportunity through the balance of this administration to move forward on normalization,” Mr. Blinken said.</p><p>Palestinian officials welcomed the crown prince’s comments, saying that they supported the position of the Ramallah-based Palestinian leadership.</p><p>“This is an affirmation that the Saudi position is enduring in its support of the Palestinian cause,” Mahmoud al-Habbash, the religious affairs adviser to Mr. Abbas, said in an interview on Thursday. “We’re reassured about the Saudi stance, which is a cornerstone of the Arab and Islamic world’s position.”</p></div></div>
