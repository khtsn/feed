His new term is scheduled to begin in January and run through 2031.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Maduro is also likely to use the decision to argue that he should not engage in negotiations with the United States, Colombia and Brazil, which have all sought to convince his government to publish evidence of his claim to victory, recognize the actual result of the vote and agree to a power transition if the tally shows a loss.</p><p>On election night last month, the country’s Maduro-friendly election council said that Mr. Maduro had won more than 50 percent of the vote, but did not provide any evidence to back this up.</p><p>Days later, the opposition movement said it had won 67 percent of the vote, and published on its website a breakdown of the result by state and even by election machine, using tally sheets collected by state-certified election observers.</p><p>The United States recognized Venezuela’s opposition presidential candidate as the winner, ratcheting up the international condemnation of a vote riddled with irregularities. Even some of Mr. Maduro’s fellow leftist leaders in Latin America expressed grave doubts about his claim of victory.</p><p>But in response to foreign governments criticizing Mr. Maduro’s victory claim, the Venezuelan leader simply ordered some of their diplomatic missions to leave his country.</p></div></div><div><p>Still, the vote posed the most significant electoral challenge to Mr. Maduro since he came to office in 2013. Throughout the campaign season, his government made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/world/americas/venezuela-election-voters-abroad.html" title="">major efforts to weaken</a> the opposition, including barring its most popular leader, María Corina Machado, from running for office.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On the night of the vote, the country’s election council claimed that President Maduro had won more than 50 percent of the vote, but did not provide any evidence to back this up.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alejandro Cegarra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Yet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/world/americas/venezuela-election-opposition-machado.html" title="">an opposition movement with enormous support emerged</a>, with Edmundo González, a former diplomat, as the man on the ticket for the opposition, backed by Ms. Machado.</p><p>Following the election, several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-election-results.html" title="">reviews of the tally sheets</a> by researchers and independent media outlets supported the opposition’s assertion that Mr. González had won.
