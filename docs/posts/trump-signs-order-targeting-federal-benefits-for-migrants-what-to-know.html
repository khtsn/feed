The Office of Management and Budget and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency have 30 days to find other streams of federal funding to people who are in the country illegally.</p><p>Here, we try to answer some questions about this latest executive order.</p><h2 id="link-5bb7b1e4">What federal benefits are undocumented immigrants eligible for now?</h2><p>Not many. There are some exceptions for emergency medical care and public schooling for children. But in general, people who are in the country illegally cannot receive federal benefits. This is enshrined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Changes to eligibility would have to go through Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The lack of federal benefits for undocumented immigrants is one reason some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/us/migrants-border-aid.html" title="">cities across the country have been struggling</a> to support an influx of people who crossed the border illegally in recent years.</p><h2 id="link-2f43d818">How much does the Trump administration say it’s spending on illegal immigrants?</h2><p>It does not say, but one goal of this executive order is to figure that out. Mr. Trump and others have asserted that undocumented immigrants are a drain on federal resources that should be going to Americans.</p><p>However, there is no current federal assessment for how much the federal government spends on undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The review will be looking for federal benefits paid to people who are not eligible to receive them, including people who are temporarily allowed to be in the country and those who have no authorization to be in the United States at all.</p><p>While conservatives have long expressed concern about undocumented immigrants claiming federal benefits, it has mostly been unfounded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“There’s not evidence of widespread benefits fraud in the United States by undocumented communities,” said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy for the National Immigration Law Center.</p><h2 id="link-4faf5cb5">What is the practical effect of this executive order?</h2><p>At this point, it is not clear what effect this order will have on existing programs and policies. The White House is directing officials to report instances in which federal benefits are being improperly given to undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Ms. Altman said the order, like the others Mr. Trump has issued related to immigration during his first month in office, will stoke more fear in immigrant communities across the country.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eileen Sullivan is a Times reporter covering national security and public safety policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eileen-sullivan">More about Eileen Sullivan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
