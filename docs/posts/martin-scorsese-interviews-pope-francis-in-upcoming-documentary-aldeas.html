Communities around the world will create scripts for short films that highlight their identities, histories and values.</p><p>Snippets of the conversation between the pope and Scorsese will be interwoven into the film, which does not have a release date.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, Scorsese said it was important to Francis for “people across the globe to exchange ideas with respect while also preserving their cultural identity, and cinema is the best medium to do that.” Before the pope’s death, Francis called “Aldeas” a poetic project because it “goes to the roots of what human life is.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The project punctuates a long relationship between the pope and Scorsese, whose work has sometimes been religious in nature.

They met again in 2023, when Scorsese announced he would make another film about Jesus. The director’s most recent project, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/arts/martin-scorsese-saints.html" title="">“Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints,”</a> dramatizes the lives of eight Catholic saints.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Before his death, Francis called “Aldeas” a poetic project because it “goes to the roots of what human life is.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aldeas Scholas Films, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When Francis died, Scorsese <a href="https://au.variety.com/2025/more/news/martin-scorsese-pope-francis-death-immense-loss-for-world-21802/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement to Variety</a> that he was lucky to have known him and that his loss for the world was immense.</p><p>“He had an ironclad commitment to the good,” Scorsese said. “He knew in his soul that ignorance was a terrible plague on humanity.
