    <h1>Times Square Revelers Ring in a Soggy New Year After Thunderstorm</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New Yorkers are used to ringing in the New Year in the cold or even the snow. But in rain, thunder and lightning? Not so much.</p><p>Heavy rain fell in New York City on Tuesday night and lightning lit up the sky, a rarity in January. But many revelers were undeterred. They showed up in Times Square in Manhattan to watch the annual ball-drop wearing ponchos. (Umbrellas were not allowed.)</p><p>Rain was forecast to fall in the New York City metro area from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., with moderate to occasionally heavy rain falling for a two to four hour period in that window, the National Weather Service’s New York office said. Thunder was predicted for the same area from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., the office said.</p><p>By about 11:30 p.m., the worst of the weather appeared to have passed over Manhattan, according to the Weather Service’s radar.</p></div></div>
