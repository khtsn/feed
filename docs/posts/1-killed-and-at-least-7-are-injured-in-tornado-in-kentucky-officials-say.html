Len Benedict, the Washington County coroner, said in an interview that the person who had been killed was a 48-year-old-man.</p><p>The National Weather Service office in Louisville, Ky., said that a preliminary survey indicated that the tornado’s winds reached at least 115 miles per hour, meaning it was <a href="https://x.com/NWSLouisville/status/1928510682565169335" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rated at least EF2</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The storm had apparently developed quickly. The Weather Service office in Lexington issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 6:46 a.m. on Friday, urging people to “remain alert for a possible tornado.” At 6:49 a.m., the same office issued a tornado warning, telling people to take cover. (Warnings are issued after a tornado is detected on a radar or a trained spotter sees a tornado, while tornado watches mean the conditions to form a tornado are in place.) Officials in Washington County received the first call for help at 7:11 a.m., Mr. Devine said.</p><p>Timothy E. Graves, the judge executive in Washington County, thanked emergency workers for their swift response, which involved officials from several surrounding counties.</p><p>“It is an isolated area, but it is total devastation,” he told a local news outlet, <a href="https://fb.watch/zVAWHwONHy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GNG Productions</a>, adding that two houses that had families inside were “just totally destroyed.”</p><p>Mr. Devine said there was also flash flooding in the area, which has small creeks that rise and then recede quickly when it rains heavily. Several roads had flooded, he said, but had since reopened.</p><p>Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky posted <a href="https://x.com/GovAndyBeshear/status/1928457717586313645" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a message</a> on social media asking people to “please pray for these families and everyone affected.” He said he was postponing planned trips to Laurel and Pulaski Counties because of the severe weather.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Everyone, please stay weather aware today,” he said in another message. “Let’s do what’s needed to keep everyone safe.”</p><p>The Weather Service has warned of possible severe storms with wind damage, large hail and a few tornadoes across much of the Mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States on Friday. The service also said that heavy rain may cause flash flooding from eastern Kentucky to southern New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Levenson covers breaking news for The Times from New York.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
