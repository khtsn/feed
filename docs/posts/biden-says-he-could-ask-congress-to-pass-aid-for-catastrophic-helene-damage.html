Residents there have been left without electricity, internet or phone connection to find their relatives. Mr. Biden described the daunting task for federal officials hoping to locate up to 600 missing people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump each gave separate public remarks about the storm on Monday. Ms. Harris cut a campaign trip short to travel back to Washington for briefings with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Monday. Mr. Biden said he planned to travel to North Carolina on Wednesday, and Ms. Harris said she would travel to the region later this week.</p><p>Ms. Harris called the damage “heartbreaking” and promised that the Biden administration would “do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover.”</p><p>Former President Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/30/us/trump-harris-election" title="">traveled to Valdosta, Ga.</a>, a hard-hit city near the state’s border with Florida, for a briefing on the storm’s impact and to help distribute relief supplies, his campaign said.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Biden for spending the weekend in Delaware and Ms. Harris for holding fund-raising events in California “when big parts of our country have been devastated by that massive hurricane.”</p><p>Mr. Biden rebutted such criticism on Monday, saying he was involved in the response from his home in Delaware.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I was commanding,” Mr. Biden said. “I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before as well.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also falsely claimed that Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia had a hard time reaching Mr. Biden for help with storm coverage. But Mr. Kemp, a Republican, said he appreciated the administration’s help and said he had spoken to Mr. Biden on Sunday.</p><p>Mr. Biden said of Mr. Trump’s account: “I’ve spoken to the governor, spent time with him, and he told him he’s lying. I don’t know why he does it. That’s simply not true, and it’s irresponsible.”</p><p>Mr. Biden added that the head of FEMA, Deanne Criswell, was on the ground in North Carolina to assess the damage. His administration had deployed 3,600 officials to assist in recovery efforts. In a sign of the scale of destruction, Mr. Biden also approved emergency requests for more than a half-dozen states, allowing FEMA to dispatch federal resources quickly.</p><p>During a second update on the government’s hurricane response on Monday, Mr. Biden held up what he described as a list of federal resources his administration was sending to the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s hard to get it from point A to point B. It’s hard to get if somebody’s roads are wiped out,” Mr. Biden said as he sat in the Oval Office alongside a monitor displaying a videoconference with Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina and emergency officials. “There’s no ability to land, there’s no ability to get trucks and no ability to get a whole range of things.”</p><p>Mr. Biden added that the federal government was providing “additional helicopters for land bridges” and search-and-rescue, as well as making sure medical supplies were getting in.</p><p>He said Asheville’s water system was “completely down.”</p><p>“Getting water in here on a sustained basis is going to be critical,” the president said. “And we are discussing the strategies to continue those efforts and to surge those efforts.”</p><p>Mr. Biden committed to continue dispatching resources to affected areas.</p><p>He also expressed “condolences to all the families, to all the families whose loved ones have died or are missing.” He said administration officials would be there for survivors until they “finish the job” of recovery.</p><p>But he cautioned that “it’s going to take a hell of a long time and a serious amount of assets.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Biden May Ask Congress to Pass Aid for ‘Catastrophic’ Damage<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
