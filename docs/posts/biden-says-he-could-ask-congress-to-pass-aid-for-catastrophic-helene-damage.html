It’s not just a catastrophic storm. It’s a historic, history-making storm. Communities are devastated. Loved ones waiting, not sure if their loved ones are OK. They can’t contact them because there’s no cellphone connections. Many more folks displaced with no idea when they’ll be able to be returned to their home, if ever, if there’s a home to return to. I’ve directed my team to provide every available resource as fast as possible to your communities to rescue, recover and to begin rebuilding. In addition to FEMA, it includes the Federal Communications Commission to help establish communications capability. The National Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Defense are going to provide all the resources at its disposal to rescue and assist in clearing debris and delivering life-saving supplies. So far, that’s over 3,600 personnel deployed. That number is growing by the day. As president, I’ve seen firsthand the devastating toll that disasters like this take on families and communities. I’ve been on the ground in many disaster areas since I’ve been president. I’m here to tell every single survivor in these impacted areas that we will be there with you as long as it takes.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/30/multimedia/30DC-BIDEN-HELENE-mgvp/30DC-BIDEN-HELENE-mgvp-threeByTwoLargeAt2X.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">During his speech at the White House on Wednesday, President Joe Biden spoke about the hurricane Helene recovery efforts saying he expects to ask congress for additional funding to the affected states.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs"><img alt="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" title="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs" itemprop="name">Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></p><p>Reporting from Washington</p></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-09-30T14:57:02-04:00">Sept. 30, 2024, <span>2:57 p.m. ET</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Biden said on Monday that he expected to ask Congress for supplemental funding to provide relief to the states devastated by Hurricane Helene, which left 100 dead and hundreds more unaccounted for.</p><p>During remarks at the White House, Mr. Biden said he might need to call Congress in for a special session to help with the response to what he called a “catastrophic” and “history-making storm.” Lawmakers left Washington last week after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/house-short-term-spending-bill.html" title="">passing a stopgap spending bill</a> to fund the government until Dec. 20 that did not include additional disaster relief funding.</p><p>“It’s devastating,” Mr. Biden said of the storm, which made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane and wreaked havoc across Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. “They’ve never seen anything like this before.”</p><p>The storm tore through the Gulf Coast of Florida and into Georgia before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/us/north-carolina-helene-asheville-shelby.html" title="">destroying entire towns across western North Carolina</a>.
