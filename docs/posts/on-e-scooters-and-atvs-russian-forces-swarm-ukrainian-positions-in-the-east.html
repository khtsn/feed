More broadly, the Kremlin now controls substantially less territory than it did in the first months of its invasion.</p><p>While Russian forces churn a destructive path through small villages in the southern Donbas region, they have yet to show themselves capable of achieving large-scale breakthroughs.</p><p>Still, Ukrainian soldiers said they were worried about the current trajectory.</p><p>“The war is far from over,” said Major Taras of the 68th Jaeger Brigade, who recently spent three months at home recovering from an injury. “There’s this impression that everyone is already talking about peace, waiting for it to come soon,” he said. “But in reality, the fighting continues.
