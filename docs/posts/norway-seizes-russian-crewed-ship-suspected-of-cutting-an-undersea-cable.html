In response to one such instance in December, NATO has <a href="https://mc.nato.int/media-centre/news/2025/nato-baltic-sentry-steps-up-patrols-in-the-baltic-sea-to-safeguard-critical-undersea-infrastructure" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stepped up its patrol and surveillance operation</a> in the Baltic Sea.</p><p>Concern about such damage has been rising since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/world/europe/pipeline-sabotage-mystery-russia.html" title="">a series of undersea explosions</a> blew apart the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines linking Russia to Western Europe in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Thursday evening, Norway’s coast guard and police surrounded the Russian-crewed ship — the Silver Dania, a vessel owned and registered in Norway — and towed it into the Port of Tromso on Friday morning, the police said.</p><p>The ship, a 36-year-old cargo vessel, <a href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/8808604" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to shipping data</a>, was sailing between the Russian ports of St. Petersburg and Murmansk. The police said that officers had boarded the ship to search for evidence and to question the crew in relation to the damaged cable.</p><p>The vessel’s owners, a shipping company called Silver Sea, denied any wrongdoing. “We agreed to go to a Norwegian port to be checked out,” Tormod Fossmark, the company’s chief executive officer, <a href="https://www.fiskeribladet.no/hendelser/bergensrederi-mistenkt-for-kabel-skadeverk-i-ostersjoen/2-1-1772898" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the Norwegian news media</a>. He said that the company was complying with a request from the authorities.</p><p>On Monday, the authorities in Sweden boarded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/europe/cable-baltic-sea-sweden-damage.html" title="">a different ship</a> in connection with what they described as an act of “gross sabotage” of the Sweden-to-Latvia undersea cable a day earlier. They detained the bulk carrier, which is owned by a Bulgarian shipping company and was flying a Maltese flag.</p><p>Russian involvement was suspected in the December cutting of an undersea cable that carries electricity between Finland and Estonia. In that instance, the Finnish authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/europe/finland-estonia-cables-russia.html" title="">seized an oil tanker</a> as they looked into whether the ship’s anchor had cut the cable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Leaders in Finland and Estonia said they believed that the tanker might be part of Russia’s “shadow fleet” of ships aimed at circumventing Western-imposed price caps on Russian sea-transported oil because of Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Such ships have increasingly come under suspicion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/world/europe/russia-ship-shadow-fleet-finland.html" title="">for their role in acts of sabotage</a> as a tactic of hybrid warfare between Russia and NATO.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Young Haitians’ Lives Disrupted: </strong>Robbed of their education and their prospects for the future, legions of Haitian children are the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/americas/haiti-children-schools.html">overlooked victims of the gang violence that has crippled the country</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cracking a Vast Art Fraud: </strong>In a remote Canadian city, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/canada/norval-morrisseau-art-fraud.html">a hardened detective and an angry rock star</a> brought down two criminal rings that had produced thousands of fake paintings sold as works by a celebrated Indigenous artist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drawing a Window Into the Middle East: </strong>The French cartoonist Riad Sattouf’s saga of his parents’ failed bicultural marriage, with its harsh depiction of life in rural Syria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/riad-sattouf-cartoons-france-syria.html">has become a literary sensation</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside the Gaza Truce Negotiations: </strong>The Qatari prime minister, working with both the Biden administration’s envoy and a representative for Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html">formed an unlikely partnership to seal the cease-fire deal</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jair Bolsonaro’s Stay-Out-of-Jail Card: </strong>The former Brazilian president, squeezed by criminal investigations, is looking to President Trump, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to shift his nation’s politics — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-trump-us.html">and maybe keep him a free man</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
