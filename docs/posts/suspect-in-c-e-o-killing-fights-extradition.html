The suspect, Luigi Mangione, is fighting extradition to New York, meaning that he could spend the next several weeks at a prison in Pennsylvania near the city where he was arrested. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/10/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-luigi-mangione" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The authorities are still trying to retrace the steps of Mangione, who they have accused of fatally shooting Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare. The suspect was found with a three-page manifesto, in which the health insurance industry was described as “parasitic,” the police said.</p><p>Mangione saw himself as a hero fighting a corrupt health insurance industry, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/luigi-mangione-manifesto.html" title="">authorities said in an internal report obtained by The Times</a>. The manifesto indicated that he saw the killing as a direct challenge to the health care industry’s “alleged corruption and ‘power games.’” The police also expressed concern that the attack could inspire violence against similar executives or other extreme behavior.</p><p><strong>Here’s what we know about the suspect:</strong> Mangione had described a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/10/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-luigi-mangione#luigi-mangione-health-issues-reddit" title="">life-altering health problems</a>.
