They are reinforcing the most crucial areas for the survival of the Syrian government and its allies, like Homs; the capital, Damascus; and the coastal areas.</p><p>Homs lies at the heart of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/middleeast/syria-assad-israel-iran.html" title="">critical land</a> corridor that runs from Lebanon to Iran, which serves as a pipeline used by Tehran to send weapons, supplies and people to Hezbollah, an armed Lebanese group that is Syria’s most important regional ally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Throughout the civil war, the Syrian regime has relied on Iran and Hezbollah — in addition to Russia — to fight the rebel efforts to oust it from power.</p><p>Despite the effort to stem their advance, the rebels on Friday continued their push south toward the city of Homs, about 30 miles south of Hama, and also captured some towns in the northern countryside, according to the rebels and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitor.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/middleeast/syria-map-control.html" title="">surprise rebel offensive</a> was launched last week by a coalition of opposition groups headed by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, It has dramatically shifted the front lines in Syria’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/world/middleeast/syria-recovery-aleppo-douma.html" title="">13-year-old civil war</a> after a long stalemate.</p><p>On Friday, the Syrian military struck rebels and their vehicles both north and south of the city of Hama, which is located in a province that shares the name, with artillery, missiles and airstrikes, assisted by its ally, Russia. Dozens of opposition fighters were killed and wounded, according to Syrian state media.</p><p>Over the weekend, the rebels took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-rebels-control.html" title="">control of the northern city Aleppo</a>, once a commercial hub and one of the largest cities in the country. The loss of Aleppo and Hama were major defeats for Mr. al-Assad. Losing Homs would be an even more significant blow for both his government and its regional allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>After withdrawing from Hama on Thursday following several days of fighting, the Syrian military issued an unusual statement explaining its pullback, saying that it was seeking to avoid battles inside the city that would endanger civilians.</p><p>But the Assad government has other considerations. Sacrificing Hama will enable the Assad government’s to shift its limited military resources and forces to the areas it regards as more important, at a time when its allies Hezbollah, Iran and Russia are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-bashar-al-assad.html" title="">weakened or distracted</a> by their own wars.</p><p>Early on Friday, the Israeli military carried out airstrikes on what it said were routes used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons near a Syrian government border crossing on its Lebanese border. The Syrian government said the Israeli strikes hit the bridge connecting the two countries and put it out of service, according to state media.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
