The Syrian regime has relied on Iran and its ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah — in addition to Russia — to fight the rebels over the course of the civil war. Russian missile strikes to try to slow the recent rebel advance have been relatively sparse, in what analysts see as a sign of Russia’s limited ability to aid Mr. al-Assad amid its war in Ukraine.</p><p>Homs is key because it lies at the heart of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/middleeast/syria-assad-israel-iran.html" title="">critical land</a> corridor that runs from Lebanon to Iran, which serves as a pipeline used by Tehran to send weapons, supplies and people to Hezbollah, the armed Lebanese group that is Syria’s most important regional ally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rebels pressed onward to Homs, in Hama, Syria, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Hasano/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Friday, the Syrian military struck rebels and their vehicles both north and south of the city of Hama with artillery, missiles and airstrikes, assisted by Russia. Dozens of opposition fighters were killed and wounded, according to Syrian state media.</p><p>Last weekend, the rebels took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-rebels-control.html" title="">control of the northern city Aleppo</a>, once a commercial hub and one of the largest cities in the country. The loss of Aleppo and Hama were major defeats for Mr. al-Assad. After withdrawing from Hama on Thursday following several days of fighting, the Syrian military issued an unusual statement explaining its pullback, saying that it was seeking to avoid battles inside the city that would endanger civilians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But sacrificing Hama also enables the Assad government to shift its limited military resources and forces to the areas it regards as more important.</p><p>That includes Homs Province and its eponymous provincial capital.In a sign of the heightened tensions, the Russian Embassy in Damascus issued a <a href="https://t.me/rusembsy/651" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> warning Russians of “the difficult military and political situation in Syria.” The Embassy added that it was reminding Russians “of the possibility of leaving the country on commercial flights through operating airports.”</p><p>Israel, meanwhile, said it was reinforcing its troops in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in 1967, in the wake of the rebel advance. In a statement, the military said it was “prepared for all scenarios, offensive and defensive.”</p><p>Israel has long been at odds with Mr. Assad and Iran. The potential ramifications for Israel should the conflict spill over into Israel are not clear.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> in Jerusalem and <!-- -->Anton Troianovski<!-- --> in Berlin contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
