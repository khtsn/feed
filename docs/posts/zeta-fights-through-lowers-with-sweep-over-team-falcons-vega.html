</span>, with no more second changes in the double-elimination format.</p>

<p>The series began with ZETA choosing Ascent for map one, starting on the attack side. After winning the pistol round, ZETA struggled to get more round wins and entered the half down 8-4. Team Falcons Vega had that lead thanks to a 15-kill half from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29903/madv">
		madv	</a>
</span>. ZETA&#39;s top performer from the first half was <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29314/moco">
		Moco	</a>
</span>, and their Spectre 4K on their defensive bonus round helped steamroll a perfect second half to win Ascent 13-8. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/39904/serena">
		SereNa	</a>
</span> was key to their defensive round wins, and worked alongside Moco to make their defense easy.</p>

<p>Team Falcon Vega&#39;s pick of Haven was next, with the team needing to improve after a 13-4 map loss in their upper bracket series against Shopify. ZETA started quickly with another pistol round win, with <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/10653/suzu">
		suzu	</a>
</span> and Moco combining for a clean site retake on defense. Their Breach-focused retakes were proving tough for Falcons to manage, with <span data-ref-id="8">

		aco	</a>
</span> landing key shots to help win rounds along with their utility.</p>

<p>Then, suzu and ZETA decided to disrupt their opponent&#39;s plans by pushing aggressively after a timeout. The Sova, Breach, and Neon ults forced Falcons to play it safe, and suzu got four kills with her ult to secure the round.</p>


<p><em>suzu rushes into Falcons&#39; spawn to get four kills.</em></p>

<p>Falcons managed to win the final two rounds of their attack half to swap sides only down 8-4, just as ZETA did on the previous map. Falcons got their defensive pistol round, to keep the map within reach, but then both teams traded round wins, which only favored the team ahead in the scoreline. ZETA closed the map out 13-7 and swept Falcons Vega to eliminate them from the tournament and continue their lower bracket run.</p>

<p>The MVP for this series was <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/39904/serena">
		SereNa	</a>
</span>, locking down sites on both Killjoy and Cypher and ending the series with a series-leading 38 kills and a 1.26 match rating. ZETA had a lockdown defense, winning 14 of their 17 defensive rounds across both maps, and SereNa was crucial in that Sentinel position.</p>
