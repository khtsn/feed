He was 82.</p><p>Ms. Parton announced his death in a statement <a href="https://x.com/DollyParton/status/1896718434941173792" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared on social media</a>. No cause was given.</p><p>“Carl and I spent many wonderful years together,” Ms. Parton said. “Words can’t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years.”</p><p>While his wife was a world-famous star, Mr. Dean was a private man who kept a low profile. In <a href="https://www.etonline.com/dolly-parton-opens-up-about-her-husband-carl-dean-and-how-some-people-dont-think-he-exists?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ETTopStories+%28Entertainment+Tonight%3A+Breaking+News%29" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2020 interview with Entertainment Tonight</a>, Ms. Parton said her husband had never wanted to be in the spotlight.</p><p>“It’s just not who he is,” Ms. Parton said. “He’s like, a quiet, reserved person and he figured if he ever got out there in that, he’d never get a minute’s peace and he’s right about that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Dean was born to Virginia Bates Dean, known as Ginny, and Edgar Henry Dean, according to Ms. <a href="https://dollyparton.com/front-porch-stories/dolly-and-carls-50th-wedding-anniversary" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Parton’s website</a>. While Ms. Parton became a country star, he pursued a quiet life owning an asphalt-paving business.</p><p>The couple met outside of the WishyWashy Laundromat the day she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/08/archives/dolly-partons-city-place-dolly-partons-city-place.html" title="">moved to Nashville in 1964</a>, according to Ms. Parton’s website, when Ms. Parton was 18 and Mr. Dean was 21.
