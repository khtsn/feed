No cause was given.</p><p>While his wife was a world-famous star, Mr. Dean was a private man who kept a low profile.

They married two years later on Memorial Day in 1966 in Ringgold, Ga., with only Ms. Parton’s mother, a preacher and his wife in attendance.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dolly Parton and Carl Dean got married on Memorial Day in 1966 in Ringgold, Ga., and they renewed their vows 50 years later in 2016.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Facebook</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Parton and Mr. Dean lived on a farm outside Nashville for decades.</p><p>Ms. Parton’s 1973 hit song “Jolene” was inspired by a bank teller who took interest in her husband in the early days of their marriage, she said <a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/10/09/95520570/dolly-partons-jolene-still-haunts-singers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview</a> with National Public Radio in 2008.</p><p>“He just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention,” Ms. Parton said in the interview. “It was kind of like a running joke between us — when I was saying, ‘Hell, you’re spending a lot of time at the bank. I don’t believe we’ve got that kind of money.’ So it’s really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.”</p><p>Ms. Parton has said her longtime husband inspired several other songs.</p><p>Early in her career, the song “Just Because I’m a Woman” described the disappointment of a man who had married someone he believed to be “an angel” but had learned she was more complex.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/si/podcast/254-dolly-parton-how-to-make-decisions-even-if-they/id1564530722?i=1000633172998" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcast interview</a> in 2023, Ms. Parton said that about eight months into their marriage, Mr. Dean “started asking me questions about my past, and I said, ‘Now, I don’t want to lie to you because I’m a pretty open, honest person, so don’t ask me nothing you don’t want the truth about.’ Anyway, I told the truth and he wasn’t too happy about that, and then I wrote that song.”</p><p>Her 2012 love ballad “From Here to the Moon and Back” was also inspired by Mr. Dean, according to her website, and she told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/dolly-parton-talks-key-lasting-marriage-husbands-influence/story?id=104657379" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ABC News</a> that her 2023 album “Rockstar” was influenced by his love of rock music.</p><p>“From the time I met him in 1964 — he just had rock ’n’ roll blasting. That’s his music,” she told ABC.</p><p>The couple celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 2016 by renewing their vows, an event that inspired her album “Pure &amp; Simple,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/dolly-parton-how-she-fell-in-love-all-over-again-with-pure-and-simple-248241/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. Parton told Rolling Stone in 2016.</a></p><p>Mr. Dean did not typically grant interviews. So rarely did Mr. Dean enter the spotlight that at certain points rumors swirled that the two were not actually married, which Ms. Parton always dispelled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“They think I just made him up,” Ms. Parton said in a television <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1070134807858645" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview in 2024</a>. </p><p>In the same interview, Ms. Parton recounted the story of going to her first awards dinner with Mr. Dean, who begrudgingly attended but was “absolutely miserable.”</p><p>After that, “we got in the car and he said, ‘You know what, I want you to do really well,’” Ms. Parton recalled, adding that he told her he “ain’t ever going to more of them damn things.” She said, with a chuckle, that she stopped asking him to attend her events after that.</p><p>Mr. Dean’s survivors include his sister, Sandra, and his brother, Donnie.</p><p>Ms. Parton has been asked in interviews over the years about wanting children. The couple talked and “dreamed about it” after they first got married, Ms. Parton <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/06/dolly-parton-more-to-me-than-big-hair-phoney-stuff" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Guardian</a>, but it wasn’t meant to be, she said. “Now that we’re older? We’re glad.”</p><p>Mr. Dean was one of the stabilizing forces in Ms. Parton’s life, Ms. Parton said.</p><p>“God has been good to me,” she said. “He gave me Carl Dean. And that was the perfect man that I needed.”</p><p>Amanda Holpuch<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
