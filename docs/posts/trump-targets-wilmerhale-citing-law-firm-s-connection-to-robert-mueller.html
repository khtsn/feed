Mueller III worked before and after he served as special counsel in the Trump-Russia investigation, expanding his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-law-firms-perkins-coie.html" title="">widespread campaign of retribution</a>.</p><p>In an executive order, Mr. Trump hit the elite firm with many of the same penalties that he had applied to its competitors who had taken on cases or causes he did not like.</p><p>He directed the cancellation of all government contracts with WilmerHale, and the suspension of any security clearances of its employees. The order also barred WilmerHale employees from federal buildings, banned them from communicating with government employees and prevented them from being hired at government agencies.</p><p>Other elite law firms have been hit with similar sanctions, leaving them to choose whether to fight the orders or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/paul-weiss-trump.html" title="">cut a deal</a> with Mr. Trump to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-law-firms-skadden-arps.html" title="">remove the restrictions</a>, even as a judge has already blocked one of the orders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/trump-perkins-coie-judge.html" title="">because it is likely to be unlawful</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The order said Mr. Trump was in part punishing WilmerHale for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/robert-mueller-wilmerhale.html" title="">the firm’s connections to Mr. Mueller</a>, who led an inquiry that the order described as “one of the most partisan investigations in American history.”</p><p>In fact, Mr. Mueller was appointed as special counsel by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s own deputy attorney general</a> amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html" title="">concerns about Mr. Trump’s desire</a> to shut down the F.B.I. investigation of his campaign after he took office. Mr. Mueller, then working at WilmerHale, resigned from the firm to lead the investigation, and returned to WilmerHale after the investigation was closed. Mr. Mueller retired from WilmerHale in 2021.</p><p>“WilmerHale rewarded Robert Mueller and his colleagues,” the order said, adding that “Mueller’s investigation epitomizes the weaponization of government, yet WilmerHale claimed he ‘embodies the highest value of our firm and profession.’”</p><p>The order also attacked diversity efforts at WilmerHale, as well as its representation of clients who Mr. Trump disagreed with, asserting that the firm “backs the obstruction of efforts” against illegal immigrants and drug trafficking.</p><p>In a statement, WilmerHale defended Mr. Mueller’s character and said the firm had “a longstanding tradition of representing a wide range of clients, including in matters against administrations of both parties.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The firm added, “We look forward to pursuing all appropriate remedies to this unlawful order.”</p><p>Matthew Goldstein<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Cameron covers politics for The Times, focusing on breaking news and the 2024 campaign.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron">More about Chris Cameron</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/robert-s-mueller">Robert S.
