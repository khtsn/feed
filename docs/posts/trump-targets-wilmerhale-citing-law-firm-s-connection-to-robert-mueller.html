    <h1>Trump Targets WilmerHale, Citing Law Firm’s Connection to Robert Mueller</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The order said Mr. Trump was in part punishing WilmerHale for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/robert-mueller-wilmerhale.html" title="">the firm’s connections to Mr. Mueller</a>, who led an inquiry that the order described as “one of the most partisan investigations in American history.”</p><p>In fact, Mr. Mueller was appointed as special counsel by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s own deputy attorney general</a> amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html" title="">concerns about Mr. Trump’s desire</a> to shut down the F.B.I. investigation of his campaign after he took office. Mr. Mueller, then working at WilmerHale, resigned from the firm to lead the investigation, and returned to WilmerHale after the investigation was closed. Mr. Mueller retired from WilmerHale in 2021.</p><p>“WilmerHale rewarded Robert Mueller and his colleagues,” the order said, adding that “Mueller’s investigation epitomizes the weaponization of government, yet WilmerHale claimed he ‘embodies the highest value of our firm and profession.’”</p><p>The order also attacked diversity efforts at WilmerHale, as well as its representation of clients who Mr. Trump disagreed with, asserting that the firm “backs the obstruction of efforts” against illegal immigrants and drug trafficking.</p><p>In a statement, WilmerHale defended Mr. Mueller’s character and said the firm had “a longstanding tradition of representing a wide range of clients, including in matters against administrations of both parties.”</p></div></div>
