The video also shows people rushing to the victims. Information on any injures was not immediately released.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/MerseyPolice/status/1927060788516127150" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Merseyside Police said</a> in a statement that a “53-year-old white British man” from the Liverpool area had been arrested at the scene after the vehicle came to a stop.</p><p>The police added: “We would ask people not to speculate on the circumstances surrounding tonight’s incident on Water Street in Liverpool city centre. Extensive enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances leading up to the collision. We would ask people not to share distressing content online.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Keir Starmer, Britain’s prime minister, said on social media: “The scenes in Liverpool are appalling — my thoughts are with all those injured or affected. I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident. I’m being kept updated on developments and ask that we give the police the space they need to investigate.”</p><p>The police said they were contacted about 6 p.m. Monday local time after reports that a car had hit the crowd. The episode drew a large response, video from the scene showed, with the vehicle surrounded by dozens of police officers and ambulances.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered along a 10-mile parade route that wound through the city to celebrate the fact that the Liverpool Football Club had won this year’s Premier League, the top tier of English soccer.</p><p>Hours earlier, the police department had urged people to celebrate safely.</p><p>“Please keep yourselves and other people safe during today’s #LFC Victory Parade by not climbing buildings, structures, scaffolding or street furniture,” the police said in a statement on X, the social media site. “The parade route covers 10 miles and there are plenty of safe vantage points to see the LFC bus. Hope everyone has a great day!”</p><p>That celebratory mood was shattered in the afternoon.</p><p>In a statement on Monday evening, Liverpool F.C. said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The club has drawn supporters from across the world, and the latest championship victory was unexpected, coming in the first season under a new coach, Arne Slot.</p><p>Liverpool had been celebrating the title for weeks, having secured it last month with several weeks of the season to go. On Sunday, the team lifted the Premier League trophy to emotional scenes inside its packed stadium. The celebrations were set to peak on Monday, which was a public holiday in Britain, as the team rode through the city on an open-top bus decked with symbols of its winning season.</p><p>“We will continue to offer our full support to the emergency services and local authorities who are dealing with this incident,” the team said in its statement.</p><p>Global episodes involving vehicles being driven into crowds have become increasingly common.</p><p>In February, a man drove a car into a crowd 10 days before elections in Munich, Germany, injuring dozens of people. A month earlier, a man deliberately drove a pickup into crowds on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens of others. And a driver barreled a large truck for more than a mile through a crowd of spectators on Bastille Day in Nice, France, in 2016. Scores were killed.</p><p>The police in Liverpool did not say anything about a motive. Under standard protocol for mass casualties in Britain where a suspect’s motivation is unexplained, the counterterror police will be involved in the investigation. Officials will be looking at the suspect’s profile and history, as well as evidence from interviews and examinations of phones and other electronic devices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The British police declare events to be terror attacks only if they are found to have met the legal definition of terrorism. That means the violence must be designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and be “for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause.”</p><p>Such decisions have become increasingly difficult for the British police in recent years. Several acts of mass violence, such as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/world/europe/uk-southport-axel-rudakubana-stabbing-violence.html" title="">stabbing attack in Southport</a>, England, last July in which three young girls were killed, have fallen short of the legal threshold because of the lack of a clear ideological motivation.</p><p>Tariq Panja<!-- --> contributed reporting from London.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
