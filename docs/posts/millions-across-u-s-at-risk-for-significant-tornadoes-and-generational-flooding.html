The relentless rain may lead to “significant and potentially historic” rainfall totals of 10 to 15 inches. This could create what forecasters called a “generational flooding” event, particularly in a region stretching from northeast Arkansas through western Tennessee, western Kentucky and into southern Indiana.</p><p>“One of the problems is that this storm system isn’t going to be allowed to continue moving east,” said Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center. An area of high pressure off the Atlantic coast will block it, he said, keeping the storm stalled while warm, moisture-laden air from the Gulf fuels heavy downpours. “That’s the crux of our concern,” Mr. Bann said.</p><p>The Weather Prediction Center has placed areas from northeast Arkansas through the mid-Mississippi Valley and into southern Indiana under a threat of “<a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/excessive_rainfall_outlook_ero.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high risk,</a>” what it calls a Level 4 out of 4, for excessive rainfall on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>A higher risk of excessive rainfall shouldn’t be taken lightly. Over the past decade, some of the deadliest and most destructive floods have occurred in areas that forecasters said were at this level of risk — a level they rarely use.
