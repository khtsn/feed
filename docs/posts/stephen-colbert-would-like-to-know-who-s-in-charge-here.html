Or as Stephen Colbert put it on Wednesday, “our government is getting spatchcocked by Elon Musk and his post-pubescent pink slip troopers.”</p><blockquote><p>“Naturally, the federal workers in their path of wanton destruction are experiencing anger, chaos and confusion, which, coincidentally, are also the Secret Service code names for Trump, Elon and Don Jr.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“It turns out being an unelected donor running an unauthorized employee kill squad might get you sued at some point in the future. So in new legal filings, the White House claims that Elon Musk is not in charge at DOGE. What? It’s literally named after his favorite meme!” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“This is the most confusing leadership structure since Ruth’s Chris Steak House. Who is Chris? Why does he seem to belong to Ruth?” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5nIPFtBNOk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“Elon and the DOGE-bags have fired so many people so quickly, in so many critical areas, with so little thought beforehand, that the government is now scrambling to rehire the nuclear staff it fired on Friday. These are folks involved with designing, building and overseeing the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile after concerns grew that their dismissal could jeopardize national security. I share those concerns.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“But here’s the wrinkle and the rub: The government has struggled to reach the people that were fired after they were locked out of their federal email accounts. So now we got a bunch of <em>[expletive]</em> people with a lot of time on their hands who know how to build nuclear weapons.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Rehiring people on Tuesday that you fired on Friday does not scream ‘government efficiency.’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-1bb02640">The Punchiest Punchlines (On Principle Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“And with Trump doing so much so fast, leave it to the Never Trumpers to do what little they can to make a fast buck. An event called the Principles First Summit convenes this weekend in D.C. What are their principles? Well, judging by the lineup, cashing in on whatever’s left of Trump envy.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p><p>“The biggest and most bitterest names in the anti-Trump world will be there: Adam Kinzinger, Michael Steele, Bill Kristol and George Conway. All that was missing was Joy Behar.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p><p>“There are a few Dems to shore up the list of yesterday’s pundits who’ve seen their audiences flee like Tim Walz hearing a car backfire.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>On Wednesday’s “Late Show,” the comic actor Tim Meadows paid tribute to Black History Month, with a few minor changes to accommodate the new administration in Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-1a7073d0">What We’re Excited About on Thursday Night</h2><p>The actress Melanie Lynskey, known for her role on “Yellowjackets,” will appear on “After Midnight.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Awards mode: Cynthia Erivo at the BAFTA Film Awards last weekend.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
