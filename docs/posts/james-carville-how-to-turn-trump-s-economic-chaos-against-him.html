Back in office this winter, he promised a golden age for the economy and the end of inflation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/economy/trump-recession-tariffs-inflation.html" title="">starting on Day 1</a> — and then we got served plenty of fish bait: blowing smoke about <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/trump-us-control-greenland/story?id=120208823" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seizing Greenland</a>, huffing and puffing <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-quest-conquer-canada-confusing-everyone-rcna195657" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about annexing Canada</a> and throwing people into a tizzy over seeking a third term, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which he</a> will never be able to do.</p><p>Now we know why. Mr. Trump didn’t have a plan to bring down inflation and make life better (except for the rich, who disproportionately benefit from his tax cuts), and he was hellbent on tariffs at all costs.</p><p>The problem is that smoke and mirrors only work until you screw up so hard that no act of lunacy can pull the American people’s attention elsewhere. And boy, did the president just screw up royally.</p><p>In what will certainly be recorded as one of the most ignorant acts of political leadership in American history, the president of the United States has now willfully damaged the global economy with his tariff chaos. Not only was this an act of economic warfare, it has broken the cardinal rule in American politics: Never destabilize the economy. With it, the Trump administration is causing enormous damage to itself — and there can be no more distraction from this naked truth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This is where the Democrats have an opening. In February I wrote a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/opinion/democrats-trump-congress.html" title="">piece</a> calling on my party’s leaders to play dead, allowing the Republicans to punch themselves out and crumble beneath their own weight. But many <a href="https://www.latintimes.com/house-democrats-introduce-bill-stop-trump-invading-panama-canada-greenland-578112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Democrats indulged Mr. Trump’s lunacy</a> or allowed themselves to become the story over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/chuck-schumer-democrats-meet-the-press.html" title="">the government funding and shutdown debate</a>, while the president continued his campaign of chaos and distraction. Now, Democrats have an opportunity to allow the Republicans to edge closer to collapse as the party in full control of Washington — let’s please not become the story again and get in their way.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months, many Americans are going to experience pressure and pain with the tariffs on China and the remaining tariffs on an array of goods and countries. Prices could rise sharply, consumer spending may well dry up and we are already seeing evidence of surging <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/mortgage-rates-surge-tariffs-bond-market.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mortgage rates</a> and a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/bond-market-moves-raise-fears-growing-bets-america-rcna200936" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weakened bond market</a>. The Trump administration will not be competent enough to dig us out. The path to stabilizing and strengthening the country starts when Democrats can take back the economic narrative from the Republican Party and persuade the majority of Americans to close the book on the Trump chaos.</p><p>This can only be done if we avoid the distractions — whether it’s Mr. Trump’s third-term talk or Democratic infighting on social issues — and instead focus on the economic foundations that matter to Americans most. My fellow Democrats, it’s time we transform our party into a projector for the economic pain of the American people.</p><p>Here’s how to do it:</p><p><strong>First, focus on prices. </strong>We must start with what matters most. President Trump won the White House on an overt promise to bring down prices. Let’s not forget his most oft-repeated claims: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG7NbwKZPKo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Starting on Day 1</a>, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods” or: “<a href="https://doggett.house.gov/issues/trumps-economic-promises-timeline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prices will come down</a>. You just watch. They’ll come down, and they’ll come down fast, not only with insurance, with everything.”</p><p>This promise is formally broken. The cost of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/auto-sales-tariffs.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trucks and vehicles</a> is set to shoot up thousands of dollars. Dame, a sexual wellness brand that makes adult toys and personal care products, implemented a $5 “<a href="https://dame.com/products/trump-tarrif-surcharge?srsltid=AfmBOorYalC2i-FDSyR1gE8I9bLjlsi-c_kU4vy5BmEDJ1NbJj_PSjxY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump tariff surcharge</a>.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/trump-china-tariffs-prices-goods.html" title="">Everything from seafood</a> to cans of beer to clothing to toys will grow more expensive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The most direct hit to working people’s pocketbooks will always be from the cost of daily goods. Making it clear that Trump and the Republicans willingly broke this promise should be in every ad, every podcast talking point, every message we send from now until the midterms.</p><p><strong>Second, it’s not about the stock market, it’s about 401(k)s. </strong>With <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saving-money-emergency-expenses-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">six in 10 Americans</a> lacking the savings to cover even a $1,000 emergency expense, Democrats cannot afford to hinge our economic narrative on the rise and fall of a market for the privileged. For younger Americans, stocks will most likely rebound and grow over time. But the tariffs are a poison dagger for those who have saved and vested into their 401(k) their entire lives, just to see it depleted by the reckless actions of the president.</p><p>You can bet certain retirees are now living in a panic, pausing home renovations and big-ticket purchases as their life savings start to drain by the day. If this continues, many retirees will have to go back into the work force, spending what should be their comfortable years grinding in the office like they are in their 30s. This is a real, substantial pain that will be felt by the Americans who are the least deserving of it. As it turns out, older voters are also some of the most reliable, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2024/election-analysis-older-voters.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">powering Trump’s re-election</a>. Democrats, uplift their stories and connect their pain to the president. Do not focus on the market or the daily percentage drop in the Magnificent Seven <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/22/business/magnificent-seven-stocks-tech.html" title="">tech stocks</a>.</p><p><strong>And third, make the message local. </strong>It’s important that as a party we understand this is not about us and that the Democratic brand is tarnished at this given moment. And instead, take our prints off of the message as much as possible. This is not about us going on CNN or taking to X to complain about the president.</p><p>The Democratic Party must now take local stories and project them where they matter most. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/recession-tariffs-canada-trump/682297/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Record the story of Nicholas Gilbert,</a> a dairy farmer upended by the tariffs — and localize it to Wisconsin. Focus on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/407337/trump-tariffs-risk-split-lose-gop-winning-coalition-majority-disapprove-opinion-latino-black-gen-z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Latino and Black men</a> who supported his previous election, and take it to Georgia or Arizona. Go on influencer networks and podcasts talking about the looming increase in car prices and the fact that the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/technology/nintendo-switch-tariffs-trump.html" title="">exploded</a> Nintendo’s plans for the Switch 2.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>For the entirety of his tenure in American politics, Donald Trump for better or worse has lived on by the grace of the American people’s faith in his economic leadership. Now it is plain and clear, just as with his failures in Atlantic City or with Trump University, that President Trump never had any idea what he was doing all along. If we avoid the distractions to come and stay focused on the economy, Democrats can take back the one issue that has kept Trump on a respirator all this time. Through all the hardships to come, we bring the silver lining. And finally, we can begin again.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>James Carville is a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns, including Bill Clinton’s in 1992, and a consultant to American Bridge, a Democratic super PAC.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
