But the money would be separate from the investment SoftBank is already putting into that project.</p><p>The sources, who requested anonymity because the talks were confidential, stressed that the terms of the investment are not yet final.</p><p>Stargate, a joint venture of SoftBank, OpenAI and the software company Oracle, could result in $500 billion of investment in computing infrastructure, the companies have said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The negotiations were reported earlier <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6a482d4f-0c90-47bf-a4c2-67a2f1b743b1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by the Financial Times</a>.</p><p>OpenAI started the A.I. boom in late 2022 with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/technology/ai-chat-bot-chatgpt.html" title="">release of its online chatbot, ChatGPT</a>. But the company has had an unusually tumultuous few years since then.</p><p>Executives are still trying to repair OpenAI’s reputation after its board of directors unexpectedly fired its chief executive, Sam Altman, about a year after ChatGPT was released. He was reinstated five days later, but OpenAI has lost several prominent employees since then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/technology/ilya-sutskever-openai-safe-superintelligence.html" title="">including Ilya Sutskever, its chief scientist and a co-founder</a>.</p><p>In October, OpenAI completed a $6.6 billion fund-raising deal that valued the company at $157 billion, nearly doubling the high-profile company’s valuation from just nine months earlier. SoftBank was part of that deal.</p><p>In December, OpenAI unveiled new A.I. technology called OpenAI o3. But not long after, a little-known Chinese start-up called DeepSeek <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/technology/what-is-deepseek-china-ai.html" title="">shocked the tech industry</a> with the release of an A.I. system that could match leading A.I. products made in the United States.</p><p>The Chinese company said it built its new A.I. technology at a lower price and with fewer hard-to-get computer chips than its American competitors, challenging an industrywide belief that bigger and better A.I. would cost many billions of dollars. OpenAI said on Wednesday that it was investigating whether <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/openai-deepseek-data-harvest.html" title="">DeepSeek may have improperly harvested</a> OpenAI’s data to help build its own systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, accusing them of copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI and Microsoft have denied those claims.)</p><p>Since DeepSeek asserted that it could build A.I. more affordably, there have been questions about the wisdom of investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new data centers. But many experts believe massive amounts of computing power will continue to provide companies like OpenAI with an edge in the market.</p><p>With more chips, they can explore new ways of building artificial intelligence. In other words, more chips can still give companies a technical and competitive advantage. More chips will also be needed to operate the new “reasoning” A.I. models like OpenAI o3. These require more computing power when people and businesses use them.</p><p>Erin Griffith contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cade Metz writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cade-metz">More about Cade Metz</a></span></p></div><div><p>Lauren Hirsch covers Wall Street, including M&amp;A, executive changes, board strife and policy moves affecting business.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lauren-hirsch">More about Lauren Hirsch</a></span></p></div><div><p>Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent for The Times based in San Francisco.
