The city is roughly 50 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta and about 25 miles west of Athens.</p><p>The area around the school<strong>,</strong> once largely farmland nestled in the Georgia pines, has been developing rapidly in the last 15 years, as new buildings have cropped up along its winding, two-lane roads, according to Winder’s mayor, Jimmy Terrell. </p><p>Winder is the seat of Barrow County, which has nearly doubled in population to 83,500 since 2000, according to census data.</p><p>Winder is a family-oriented, middle-income community with an aging population, Mr. Terrell said. The area has not had a crime of “this magnitude” since a series of murders in the 1960s and ’70s, Mr. Terrell said in a phone interview. </p><p>In Winder, about 60 percent of the population is white, about 20 percent is Black and about 15 percent is Latino, according to <a href="https://data.census.gov/map/060XX00US1301393390?layer=VT_2020_060_00_PY_D1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">census figures.</a> The area has grown more diverse in recent years, Mr. Terrell said. The city’s median household income is about $57,000, <a href="https://data.census.gov/map/060XX00US1301393390?layer=VT_2020_060_00_PY_D1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the census</a>, and about one in five people in the city have attained a bachelor’s degree. Barrow County as a whole has a larger share of families with children than other places in Georgia and the U.S., according to the data.</p><p>The city leans Republican, Mr. Terrell said. In the 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-georgia.html" title="">presidential election</a>, Donald J. Trump won Barrow County, which surrounds the city, with about 71 percent of the vote.</p><p>Apalachee High School opened in 2000, and has about 1,800 students in grades nine through 12. </p><p>Robert Gebeloff<!-- --> and <!-- -->Emmett Lindner<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
