    <h1>As Potential TikTok Ban Looms, What Will Happen to the Platform’s Food Creators?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Whether you cherish your morning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/18/business/media/tiktok-ban-american-culture.html" title="">TikTok</a> scroll or the mere mention of the video platform sends you shrieking into a sensory-deprivation pod, there is no denying that the app has fundamentally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/07/dining/cooking-videos-tiktok.html" title="">transformed culinary culture</a> in the United States.</p><p>The app has saved restaurants from closing, helped strangers form tight-knit communities and occasionally made Americans feel a little less <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/magazine/loneliness-epidemic-cure.html" title="">alone</a>. And for recipe developers, chicken-tender reviewers and everyone in between, TikTok has presented the opportunity to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/dining/tiktok-food.html" title="">build a substantial livelihood</a> somewhat casually using the app’s creator fund, which pays users directly based on video views, as well as through sponsorships with brands. If the new American dream is to go viral, then clicking “post” on TikTok is the modern equivalent of punching in at 9 a.m.</p><p>Last year, President Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/technology/bytedance-tiktok-ban-bill.html" title="">signed a bill into law</a> that could lead to a ban of the app in the United States on Jan. 19. Last week, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/10/us/tiktok-ban-supreme-court" title="">heard arguments</a> from both sides of the debate. As a potential ban looms, we spoke to 11 influential TikTok food content creators about what is at stake. Their responses have been edited for length and clarity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-1f32227e">Jane Kim, 67, and Ed Kim, 36, Portland, Ore.</h2><h3 id="link-3b6e5032"><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thekoreanmama" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@thekoreanmama</a>, 820,400 followers</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Ed Kim</strong>: When we started TikTok, mom really had no retirement in sight — she was going to work 40 hours a week at a casino until her body physically couldn’t do her job anymore. I have hundreds of thousands in student loan debt. So when TikTok came up and we started to see we can make a decent amount of money to pay the rent, that’s when it clicked: This is real.</p><p>There have been really cool opportunities not only money wise, but opening her eyes to different food and cultures, and then we get to spend a lot of time together, too. The thing mom says is that it’s like her second life. She never really expanded outside of McDonald’s breakfast, or things like that. It’s a whole new world — trying Indian food for the first time.</p><p><strong>Jane Kim</strong>: When I heard of the ban, I feel so sorry and sad and down, because I learned a lot of things through TikTok.</p><p><strong>Favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/world/middleeast/fruit-roll-ups-smuggle-israel-tiktok.html" title="">Wrapping ice cream with a fruit roll-up</a></p><p><strong>Least favorite TikTok food trend:</strong> Taste-testing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/dining/drinks/malort.html" title="">Jeppson’s Malört</a></p><h2 id="link-116ee146">Ivan McCombs, 35, Los Angeles</h2><h3 id="link-32d41c21"><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rkihd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@rkihd</a>, 11.2 million followers</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>It just really sucks that, as Americans, we finally got something that could pay the bills. So many people couldn’t pay the bills, and a lot of people hated their 9-to-5s. TikTok came along, and they got encouraged to just post something, and they did and they found their group of people. With the money they were making on TikTok, they were able to quit their 9-to-5s, which were making them miserable and not mentally well, and do something they loved.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That’s what sucks most about the bans — it’s not about people losing tons of money, it’s that it gave people a place to belong. I built a huge community of like-minded individuals, and before I didn’t know they existed.</p><p><strong>Favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rkihd/video/6891403501461720326" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ramen lasagna</a></p><p><strong>Least favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/dining/baked-feta-pasta-tiktok.html" title="">Feta pasta</a></p><h2 id="link-45884c91">Soy Nguyen, 33, Los Angeles</h2><h3 id="link-2f45b1a7"><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@foodwithsoy?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@foodwithsoy</a>, 1 million followers</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>TikTok has always been where the people are — where actual, everyday people are. I’m an everyday person. TikTok is one of the biggest search engines in the world. You’re going to search on TikTok before Google these days. It changed how people view food, more than just hearing from critics and Michelin guides.</p><p>There’s this African dish called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/dining/fufu-recipe-swallows.html" title="">fufu</a>. I really liked when everyone was going out to try it, because I also learned how to make it, I learned the history of it. When I was growing up, I watched a lot of Food Network and I learned about the history of stuff, but I never learned about African food. If I had TikTok growing up, this would have continued to open my mind on what food can be.</p><p><strong>Favorite TikTok food trend: </strong>Everyone trying <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021958-fufu-swallows" title="">fufu</a></p><p><strong>Least favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/nature-cereal?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nature’s cereal</a></p><h2 id="link-3fa37551">Audrey Jongens, 26, and Meg Radice, 26, New York City</h2><h3 id="link-78bd5f22"><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theviplist?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@theviplist</a>, 458,000 followers</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Ms. Jongens</strong>: TikTok made the restaurant review much more approachable to younger generations — our generation isn’t really going to the newspaper to read a review. So to see someone your age telling you if they like the overall experience of a restaurant is much more relatable.</p><p><strong>Ms. Radice</strong>: And you have receipts. Say we roasted a place, and the place is like, “They’re lying, it wasn’t that bad.” We have the videos.</p><p><strong>Ms. Jongens</strong>: Everyone is so focused on how the creators are going to move forward if the app is banned, but what needs to be recognized is a lot of restaurants have gotten their start on TikTok. It has helped them create a platform to get people in the door as soon as they open. And that’s something that’s going to be lost. I wonder if without TikTok, newer restaurants will see a decrease in sales.</p><p><strong>Ms. Jongens</strong>: Where am I going to get my news?</p><p><strong>Favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/dining/tiktok-cucumber-guy-logan-moffitt.html" title="">Cucumbers</a>, the tables full of nachos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/style/caviar-cheaper-snack-doritos-china-farmed.html" title="">caviar</a></p><p><strong>Least favorite TikTok food trend: </strong>Feta pasta</p><h2 id="link-483253d5">Justine Doiron, 30, Brooklyn, N.Y.</h2><h3 id="link-4b435567"><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justine_snacks?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@justine_snacks</a>, 2.3 million followers</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>I was built on TikTok, so I know the power the app has, but personally I’m not as concerned about a ban because everyone is interpreting it differently, and my platform is diversified. What I am concerned about is the small business owners who have built their livelihood on either the creator fund for the app, or on using the app to sell the product that they’re selling.</p><p>Conversion rates on TikTok are just so much higher. I “sell” a recipe on my blog — so every video I post is pitching a person to go to my blog to make a recipe, which they don’t pay for, but which inadvertently makes me revenue. For small business owners who are selling a product, they experience that same conversion rate.</p><p><strong>Favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/dining/butter-boards.html" title="">Butter boards</a></p><p><strong>Least favorite TikTok food trend: </strong>People making ridiculously over-the-top, disgusting recipes for the sake of catering to a sexual kink</p><h2 id="link-494e34ff">Tuệ Nguyễn, 26, Los Angeles</h2><h3 id="link-78d63861"><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@twaydabae?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@twaydabae</a>, 689,100 followers</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>TikTok has given me so many opportunities I wouldn’t have thought in a million years would happen to me. It was how I was able to get <a href="https://la.eater.com/2023/7/17/23797850/di-di-restaurant-vietnamese-west-hollywood-los-angeles-new-opening-tiktok-tway-da-bae-tue-nguyen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my restaurant</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/dining/best-cookbooks.html" title="">my cookbook</a> deal. My platform grew basically overnight. And growing on TikTok wasn’t necessarily easy, but the platform and algorithm made it easier to be seen and have my content come to the right pages.</p><p>Everyone’s For You page is so curated to them. That algorithm helped with bringing my content to people who actually wanted to watch. Other platforms, you’re basically begging people to come watch.</p><p><strong>Favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/dining/penne-all-vodka-recipe.html" title="">Spicy vodka sauce</a>, a.k.a.

You’re a random 18-year-old kid. The blog was a fun thing for me to track my progress, but there was really no way to reach new people — it was me and my grandma and her friends reading it.</p><p>But once Covid hit, I blew up sort of overnight. I started making cooking videos in my dorm kitchen, and then I was at my parents’ house and I made like five cooking videos a day, and I gained two million followers in a matter of months. TikTok was designed in a way that predisposed you to discovering new people.</p><p><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/scheckeatscooking-smarter-jeremy-scheck?variant=41022403837986" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>His cookbook</em></a><em> was published in 2023.

It’s not that the path is disappearing, but it’s that the path behind me is disappearing. A great piece of advice I got from this guy who blew up on Tumblr years ago was, “Social media is like building real estate on sand.”</p><p>You cannot do that. You never know, with laws and regulations and algorithms, whether your business will thrive or fall apart the next day. It’s so important to have something else. Your email list is yours. Nobody can eff with your email list.</p><p><strong>Favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/pesto-eggs-review-23176092" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pesto eggs</a>, Gigi Hadid pasta</p><p><strong>Least favorite TikTok food trend: </strong>“I enjoyed all the food trends! Of course, it’s always upsetting when I see non-Asian people making fun of Asian food, but I don’t think that’s really a trend.”</p><h2 id="link-3dc2efeb">Nasim Lahbichi,<em> </em>26, Brooklyn, N.Y.</h2><h3 id="link-3e215e99"><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lahbco" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@lahbco</a>, 574,900 followers</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>In terms of working with brands, which is my main source of income, they will often want to work you on Instagram versus TikTok, because of that spontaneity of the algorithm. The brands want to make sure they’re reaching your community, not some random person who doesn’t care what you’re saying.</p><p>But I worked with a peanut butter brand that I loved growing up, and I was like, I’m not going to post this to Instagram because it feels like such a silly ad, but I’ll do it for TikTok because it can hit random people. It’s kind of like when you feel nervous to perform in front of your friends and family because they know you and they might judge you more, versus a random person, and you’re like, I could never care if I ever saw them again.</p><p><strong>Favorite TikTok food trend: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/style/girl-dinner.html" title="">Girl dinner</a></p><p><strong>Least favorite TikTok food trend: </strong>Feta pasta</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>How will we eat in 2025? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/dining/food-eating-predictions-2025.html">Food forecasters see a year of offbeat choices</a>, including savory coffees, great convenience-store cuisine and sauces on everything.</p></li><li><p>The U.S. surgeon general’s warning about the link between drinking and cancer comes at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/dining/drinks/restaurants-alcohol-surgeon-general-warning.html">precarious time for restaurant owners</a> trying to pencil out a profit that hinges on alcohol sales.</p></li><li><p>Slices of New York-style pizza, once confined to the city’s five boroughs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/dining/new-york-pizza-slice.html">have now gone fully nationwide</a>.</p></li><li><p>In this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/dining/american-bakeries-golden-age.html">golden age of American bakeries</a>, virtuosic pastries and delightful breads are close at hand, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-bakeries-america.html">from coastal Maine to downtown Los Angeles</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Eating in New York City</strong></p><ul><li><p>From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-nyc-pizza-pizzeria.html">pizza</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-bagels-nyc.html">bagels</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-nyc-sandwiches.html">sandwiches</a>, we’re searching all five boroughs for the food that defines New York City.</p></li><li><p>At Cafe Mado in Brooklyn, the heart of an adventurous tasting-menu restaurant beats within a relaxed comfort-food retreat. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/dining/cafe-mado-nyc-restaurant-review.html">Read our review</a>.</p></li><li><p>Our three critics named the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/dining/best-2024-new-nyc-restaurants.html">14 new restaurants in New York City</a> that dazzled them the most in 2024.</p></li><li><p>To little fanfare, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/dining/sushi-sho-nyc.html">one of Japan’s great sushi masters</a> is sweating the details of the exacting Edomae tradition at Sushi Sho in Midtown.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
