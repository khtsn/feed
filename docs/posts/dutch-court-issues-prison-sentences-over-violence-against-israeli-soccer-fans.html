In the prelude to the match, which was against the Amsterdam team, Ajax, supporters of the Israeli team had stolen and burned a Palestinian flag, while others chanted racist epithets and attacked a cab.</p><p>Four of the defendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one month to six months, though people found guilty of similar offenses are usually sentenced to community service. “In this context, only a prison sentence is appropriate,” the judge said.</p><p>Some of the defendants were part of a 900-person WhatsApp group, named “Community Center II,” in which they discussed attacks as well as shared locations and the flight information of some of the Israeli fans, the court said. In the chat group, some of the defendants explicitly said they were looking to beat up Jews.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I may never get this chance again,” one of them wrote.</p><p>The court is expected to rule in two other cases, including attempted manslaughter charges, at a later date.</p><p>The court said it had also taken into account the Israeli supporters’ actions, along with the sense of dissatisfaction among large parts of Dutch society with the war in Gaza. But the judge said that the wider context was “no justification for the violence and insults” that were levied against the Israelis.</p><p>At a hearing in the cases this month, Ejder Köse, a lawyer for one of the defendants, accused the public prosecutor of operating with a double standard. “These cases were investigated so quickly,” he said in court on Dec. 12. “Why not one from the Maccabi side? You’re only focusing on the pro-Palestine side.”</p><p>The police in Amsterdam arrested at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/europe/amsterdam-israeli-soccer-attack-report.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">62 people</a> in connection with the violence, including 10 who live in Israel. Those people either received fines or the cases were dismissed, according to Franklin Wattimena, the spokesman for the Dutch public prosecutor.</p><p>Most of those arrests had been for minor offenses, the authorities said, but charges also included public violence and attempted manslaughter, as well as violence against the riot police.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Forty-five people were issued fines for disturbing the peace, unruly behavior or being unable to show identification when requested by police officers.</p><p>More arrests could follow, according to Mr. Wattimena, who said the public prosecutor’s office was still investigating about 100 people in connection with the violence.</p><p>In a report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/europe/amsterdam-israeli-soccer-attack-report.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">released last month</a>, Amsterdam’s mayor, Femke Halsema, described the violence as “a toxic cocktail of antisemitism, hooligan behavior, and anger over the war in Palestine and Israel, and other countries in the Middle East.”</p><p>The events also drew an international outcry, including from President Biden and the leaders of Israel and the Netherlands.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Turning Allies Into Enemies: </strong>The United States killed its own allies in Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/afghanistan-allies-enemies-nuristan-taliban.html">sabotaging itself in a part of the country</a> where it never needed to be.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Drives Both Sides in Sudan’s War: </strong>Famine and ethnic cleansing stalk Sudan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/africa/sudan-gold-rush-heart-civil-war.html">Yet the gold trade is booming</a>, enriching generals and propelling the fight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reining In Argentina’s Inflation: </strong>President Javier Milei has been praised inside and outside Argentina for taming the world’s highest inflation rate. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html">But his policies have inflicted widespread hardship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nudging Japan Forward: </strong>In a society used to quiet consensus-building, Tokyo has made bold changes to its defense policy.
