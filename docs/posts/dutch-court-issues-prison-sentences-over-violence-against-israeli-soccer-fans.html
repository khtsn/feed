In the prelude to the match, which was against the Amsterdam team, Ajax, supporters of the Israeli team had stolen and burned a Palestinian flag, while others chanted racist epithets and attacked a cab.</p><p>Four of the defendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one month to six months, though people found guilty of similar offenses are usually sentenced to community service. “In this context, only a prison sentence is appropriate,” the judge said.</p><p>Some of the defendants were part of a 900-person WhatsApp group, named “Community Center II,” in which they discussed attacks as well as shared locations and the flight information of some of the Israeli fans, the court said. In the chat group, some of the defendants explicitly said they were looking to beat up Jews.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I may never get this chance again,” one of them wrote.</p><p>The court is expected to rule in two other cases, including attempted manslaughter charges, at a later date.</p><p>The court said it had also taken into account the Israeli supporters’ actions, along with the sense of dissatisfaction among large parts of Dutch society with the war in Gaza. But the judge said that the wider context was “no justification for the violence and insults” that were levied against the Israelis.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
