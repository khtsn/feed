<p><strong>Given the results of today and in general, how has the evolution of the team been throughout the group stage?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>keznit: &#34;KRÜ went through a really tough year. There&#39;s been a lot of changes such as the addition of heat and mta. We had a better year than 2023, where we qualified to Champions by getting into the top three in VCT Americas. We practiced really well, and obviously there are some things to fix for a better result next time. I feel that this roster has the most potential out of all the other ones. I&#39;m a bit sad because this is the third year that I didn&#39;t get into playoffs, but I believe in the potential of the team for next time.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How does mta feel about his performance as an individual?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mta: &#34;I had a crazy year. At first I couldn&#39;t play, and all of a sudden we qualify for Champions and I&#39;m playing in Champions. I have this reflection of it being a tough year, but given everything, such as the accident that happened with me and not being able to play at the start of the year, I&#39;m still happy to get where I got and I&#39;m happy in my performance as an individual and as a team.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What was your overview of the series and general, and were there any big issues that you could pinpoint as the main cause of FNATIC&#39;s victory today?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Atom: &#34;I think that we started the game pretty well, this team is full of qualities and strengths. But sadly, I feel as though we are not at this point where we can consistently play as we are supposed to play or consistently follow our protocols and our game system. Coming into the match against a team like FNATIC, you can&#39;t fail that. You need to be strong and consistent at what you do. Overall, that&#39;s what I think gave them the victory.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The year was very eventful for Melser. You went from starting the year IGLing to not IGLing, then going back into the position. In the midst of this, you had to handle new versions of the roster with heat and mta being added to the roster. How are you going to look back at the year?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Melser: &#34;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming next, but we&#39;re going to do our best. I feel both happy and sad, more happy if anything since I want to dedicate myself to Controller. I think maybe I could&#39;ve done more, but I&#39;m very happy with the responsibility of being an IGL. Today, we showed not only our best face but also our worst face against FNATIC. Our loss was because we didn&#39;t apply ourselves like we wanted to.&#34;</p>
