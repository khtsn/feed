Hezbollah said it had launched a “swarm of attack drones” over the border into Israel.</p><p>“We are studying and investigating the incident — how a drone infiltrated without warning and struck the base,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. “We must provide better defense.”</p><p>Over the past week, Israel has intensified its assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon, inflicting heavy bombardments around the capital, in southern Lebanon, and elsewhere. Lebanon’s government said that at least 23 people had been killed over the past 24 hours. But the airstrikes and ground invasion, which began two weeks ago, have so far failed to accomplish their stated goal: preventing cross-border attacks by the militants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Sunday, sirens warning of incoming rocket fire sounded across northern Israel, with Israel’s military saying that Hezbollah had fired around 115 rockets or missiles as of 3 p.m. local time.</p><p>Concern about further attacks on Israel, which is also at war with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, prompted the United States to announce on Sunday that it was sending an advanced missile defense system to Israel, and 100 troops to operate it. That will put American forces still closer to the war in the Middle East. </p><p>The Institute for the Study of War, a research group based in Washington, said in <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-12-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new report</a> that Hezbollah’s continued rocket attacks were aimed at undermining Israeli public support for the invasion of Lebanon, which came after a year of rocket exchanges.</p><p>Hezbollah began its rocket barrages more than a year ago in solidarity with Hamas, the day after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran.</p><p>As Israeli troops have moved into southern Lebanon this week, they have found themselves at loggerheads with United Nations peacekeepers there to try to maintain a buffer zone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a new incident on Sunday, Israeli tanks entered a U.N. peacekeeping base, drawing a protest from the U.N. mission, which said it had put the lives of its soldiers in danger.</p><p>The tank incursion came after days of criticism of Israeli forces over attacks that have wounded at least four peacekeepers in Lebanon.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/world/middleeast/unifil-un-peacekeepers-lebanon.html?timespastHighlight=eve,AND,lebanon" title="">peacekeeping force</a>, known as UNIFIL, has been stationed in southern Lebanon for four decades, tasked with trying to keep the border area free of weaponry and military forces.</p><p>Early Sunday morning, the U.N. mission said, Israeli battle tanks showed up at one of its bases.</p><p>“While peacekeepers were in shelters, two I.D.F. Merkava tanks destroyed the position’s main gate and forcibly entered the position,” it said in a statement, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. Israeli soldiers, it said, requested multiple times that the base turn out its lights.</p><p>While no peacekeepers were hurt, the entry of Israeli forces onto a U.N. base risked undermining its neutral status and making it a target for Hezbollah. It said the tanks left 45 minutes later after the mission filed a protest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Israeli military said that the incident happened as its forces were trying to evacuate troops who had come under Hezbollah missile fire. It was in contact with the U.N. mission throughout the incident, a military spokesman, Nadav Shoshani, told reporters. He said the tank had not been “storming” the base.</p><p>Israel says that the peacekeeping force, which is largely observational, has failed to prevent Hezbollah from building up its military presence along the frontier and that the militants operate near the peacekeeping bases.</p><p>In recent weeks, Israeli officials have called on the mission to pull back, and on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1845423781264711761" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reiterated that demand</a> in a message directed at the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres.<span>  </span>“Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>UNIFIL armored personnel carriers departing a base to patrol near the Lebanon-Israel border, in Marjayoun, Lebanon, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carl Court/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The prime minister said “we regret the harm” to the soldiers wounded in the earlier incidents.<span>  </span>“We are doing our utmost to prevent such harm,” he said, “but the simplest and most obvious way to ensure this is simply to withdraw them from the danger zone.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The U.N. force has rejected Israel’s calls to leave its positions in southern Lebanon, noting that its presence there is mandated by the U.N. Security Council. Mr. Guterres does not have authority over UNIFIL.</p><p>The American defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, said he had spoken on Saturday with Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and “<a href="https://x.com/SecDef/status/1845241535907955090" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strongly emphasized</a> the importance of ensuring the safety and security” of the peacekeepers, as well as of Lebanese forces.</p><p>In his own statement, Mr. Gallant said on Sunday that “the incident involving UNIFIL troops” was being investigated and that Israel’s military “will continue to take measures to avoid harm to UNIFIL troops and peacekeeping positions.”</p><p>On Sunday morning, the Israeli military said that its jets had hit around “200 Hezbollah targets deep in Lebanon and southern Lebanon” over the past day as its soldiers clashed with Hezbollah militants in the southern part of the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The Lebanese Red Cross said overnight that it was responding to a “major strike” in the southern city of Nabatieh, <a href="https://x.com/RedCrossLebanon/status/1845165516257644738" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posting an image</a> on social media that showed flames and rubble. Lebanon’s civil defense said on Sunday morning one person had been killed and four others wounded.

On Sunday, the Israeli military said that two more soldiers had been severely wounded in combat. It also said that Israeli forces had captured a Hezbollah fighter in a tunnel during a raid in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div><div><p>Thomas Fuller, a Page One Correspondent for The Times, writes and rewrites stories for the front page.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-fuller">More about Thomas Fuller</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Hezbollah Strikes Back With Swarm of Drones<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
