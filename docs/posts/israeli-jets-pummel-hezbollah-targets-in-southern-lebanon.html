Hours later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel repeated his call for the United Nations to pull the peacekeepers out of the area immediately.</p><p>The tank incursion came after days of criticism of Israeli forces over attacks that have wounded at least four peacekeepers in Lebanon. Israel forces crossed into that country two weeks ago to stop the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah from firing rockets and drones across the frontier.</p><p>Later in the day, Israeli military radio reported what it described as a mass-casualty event in Binyamina, a town in the Haifa district of northern Israel. The state broadcaster Kan said it was caused by a drone strike. Three people were in critical condition and 19 others were wounded, according to Israel’s emergency service. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/world/middleeast/unifil-un-peacekeepers-lebanon.html?timespastHighlight=eve,AND,lebanon" title="">peacekeeping force</a>, known as UNIFIL, has been stationed in southern Lebanon for four decades, tasked with<span>  </span>trying to keep the border area free of weaponry and military forces. But over the past year, Hezbollah has stepped up rockets on Israel from there, and srael last month began an intense air and ground operation to eliminate the militants across Lebanon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Early Sunday morning, the U.N. mission said, Israeli battle tanks showed up at one of its bases.</p><p>“While peacekeepers were in shelters, two I.D.F. Merkava tanks destroyed the position’s main gate and forcibly entered the position,” it said in a statement, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. Israeli soldiers, it said, requested multiple times that the base turn out its lights.</p><p>While no peacekeepers were hurt, the entry of Israeli forces onto a U.N. base risked undermining its neutral status and making it a target for Hezbollah, the peacekeepers said. It said the tanks left 45 minutes later after the mission filed a protest.</p><p>The Israeli military said that the incident happened as its forces were trying to evacuate 25 troops who had come under Hezbollah missile fire from an area close to a UNIFIL post. The I.D.F. was in contact with the U.N. mission throughout the incident, a military spokesman, Nadav Shoshani, told reporters. He said the tank had not been “storming” the base.</p><p>Israel says that the peacekeeping force, which is largely observational, has failed to prevent Hezbollah from building up its military presence along the frontier and that the militants operate near the peacekeeping bases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In recent weeks, Israeli officials have called on the mission to pull back, and on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1845423781264711761" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reiterated that demand</a> in a message directed at the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres.<span>  </span>“Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The UNIFIL base in southern Lebanon earlier this month.

But the simplest and most obvious way to ensure this is simply to withdraw them from the danger zone.”</p><p>The U.N. force has rejected Israel’s calls to leave its positions in southern Lebanon, noting that its presence there is mandated by the U.N. Security Council. Mr. Guterres does not have authority over UNIFIL.</p><p>On Sunday, about two hours after the initial tank incident, the U.N. force said, the base reported that several rounds had been fired from a position around 100 yards north. It did not say which forces had fired the rounds.</p><p>The peacekeeping mission has not stopped Israel from pouring troops across the border in pursuit of Hezbollah, which like Hamas in Gaza is backed by Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since Hamas led a deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7 last year, Israel has been fighting to destroy Hamas, devastating Gaza in the process. But in recent weeks, Israel has also stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah.</p><p>On Sunday morning, the Israeli military said that its jets had hit around “200 Hezbollah targets deep in Lebanon and southern Lebanon” over the past day as its soldiers clashed with Hezbollah militants in the southern part of the country.</p><p>The Lebanese Red Cross said overnight that it was responding to a “major strike” in the southern city of Nabatieh, <a href="https://x.com/RedCrossLebanon/status/1845165516257644738" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posting an image</a> on social media that showed flames and rubble. Lebanon’s civil defense said on Sunday morning one person had been killed and four others wounded. Lebanon’s government said that at least 23 people had been killed over the past 24 hours.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed buildings on a commercial street on Sunday hit overnight by Israeli airstrikes, in Nabatieh town, south Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammad Zaatari/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations agency that aids Palestinians, said on Sunday that he had just visited Lebanon where teams from his organization were helping Lebanese, Palestinians and Syrians <a href="https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1845377922086883388" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affected by the fighting</a>. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The expansion of the war into Lebanon is taking us away from reaching a cease-fire needed for respite for civilians across the region,” he said on social media.</p><p>In recent days, Israeli forces in southern Lebanon have fired several times at UNIFIL positions. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Sunday became the latest leader to criticize Israel over the attacks. She “reiterated the unacceptability of UNIFIL being attacked by Israeli armed forces,” the Italian government said in a statement that followed a phone conversation between Ms. Meloni and Mr. Netanyahu.</p><p>The American defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, said he had spoken on Saturday with Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and “<a href="https://x.com/SecDef/status/1845241535907955090" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strongly emphasized</a> the importance of ensuring the safety and security” of the peacekeepers, as well as of Lebanese forces.</p><p>Mr. Gallant said in his own statement on Sunday that “the incident involving UNIFIL troops” was being investigated and that Israel’s military “will continue to take measures to avoid harm to UNIFIL troops and peacekeeping positions.”</p><p>Around a dozen Israeli troops have been killed during the current operation. On Sunday, the Israeli military said that two more soldiers had been severely wounded in combat. It also said that Israeli forces had captured a Hezbollah fighter in a tunnel during a raid in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hiba Yazbek covers the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a focus on Palestinian affairs and society in the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and Israel.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hiba-yazbek">More about Hiba Yazbek</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yoav-gallant">Yoav Gallant</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
