</span> respectively. </p>



<p>The first match of the day saw two familiar opponents in their fifteenth matchup over the past five years. Both sides sought to prove themselves after shaky 2-1 wins over their previous middle bracket opponents.</p>

<p>FNATIC selected <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594755/team-liquid-vs-fnatic-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr2/?game=244351&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Corrode</a> for the first map after both teams had lost their most recent showings on it. On broadcast, the coaching staff cited attack side improvements as the reason behind the pick, and although FNATIC still struggled to manage the clock in certain rounds, they did find more success with seven attacking round wins rather than the two they picked up in regulation <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594752/fut-esports-vs-fnatic-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr1/?game=244343&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">versus FUT</a>.</p>

<p>On defense, FNATIC continued to be as stalwart as ever, shutting Liquid down at every turn and winning six consecutive rounds off the back of an <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> ace on the bonus to win a straightforward 13-5. Alfajer and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4/crashies">
		crashies	</a>
</span> stood together at the top of the scoreboard, the former going 18/10/2 with 282 ACS on Vyse and the latter going 19/10/4 with 292 ACS as Sova. </p>


<p><em>Alfajer picks off all five Liquid members for his seventh ace in VCT EMEA.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594755/team-liquid-vs-fnatic-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr2/?game=244352&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a> was a mirror matchup as both sides opted into a Raze-Yoru frontline and an Astra-Viper backline. FNATIC started on the attack side with their signature slow pace, exploiting Liquid&#39;s passive and disjointed setups to force a double timeout from Liquid by 6-1. After the timeout, Liquid got more proactive, but the damage was done and the half ended 9-3 in favor of FNATIC.</p>

<p>In the second half, Liquid began pulling back the score, winning pivotal rounds including a 1v2 from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/18350/miniboo">
		MiniBoo	</a>
</span> in round 16 and an all-in force buy in round 19 to bring things back to 11-9. That was as far as they could go, however, as Alfajer found a Showstopper double kill in the final round to take the map 13-9. </p>


<p><em>MiniBoo pulls off a sneaky 1v2 clutch.</em></p>

<p>FNATIC moves on in the middle bracket and will <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594757/natus-vincere-vs-fnatic-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr3" target="_blank">next play</a> <span data-ref-id="7">

</span>, with the middle final still two more wins away. Team Liquid descend to the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594764/team-liquid-vs-tbd-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-lr2" target="_blank">lower bracket</a> and will fight for survival against the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594762/pcific-esports-vs-ulf-esports-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-lr1" target="_blank">PCIFIC Esports versus ULF Esports</a>. </p>



<p>The last time GIANTX and Heretics faced off, Heretics eliminated GIANTX from the lower bracket of the Champions Paris playoffs. GIANTX today exacted their revenge in two maps, defeating Heretics for the first time in their fifth all-time attempt. </p>

<p>For the first map, GIANTX took Heretics to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594756/giantx-vs-team-heretics-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mr2/?game=244354&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>, where Heretics opted into a traditional Ascent-esque composition with Jett, Sova, KAY/O, and Cypher. The first half was a close 6-6 affair; GIANTX had a 3-0 start after shutting down a round two Stinger force buy from Heretics, but Heretics responded via punishing GIANTX&#39;s aggressive pushes and pulling off multiple B site executes. </p>

<p>Heretics gained the upper hand at the start of the second half, going up 10-7, but everything came crashing down for them soon after as GIANTX won a thrifty round in round 18 and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/6959/flickless">
		Flickless	</a>
</span> pulled off a 1v3 in round 20. From there, GIANTX held fast to the advantage they were given, streaking all the way back to a 13-10 win.</p>


<p><em>Flickless duels three to swing Abyss back in GIANTX&#39;s favor.</em></p>

<p>GIANTX continued their momentum into Haven, winning the second-round eco to take an instant 5-1 lead. While <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/34684/westside">
		westside	</a>
</span> surprised with a Veto pick, <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11332/ara">
		ara	</a>
</span> and Flickless turned out to be the critical pieces of the puzzle as ara racked up Outlaw and Operator kills as Neon and Flickless held down key choke points as Viper. </p>

<p>Heretics managed to get five rounds by halftime by punishing GIANTX&#39;s proactive reclears, but the second half was all GIANTX. Heretics repeatedly allowed GIANTX to get onto sites with minimal resistance and found any retakes all but impossible against the Viper and Veto utility. GIANTX were completely in control as they won out 13-7. Flickless was the top fragger on the map and the series as a whole, going 23/12/9 on Haven and 41/29/16 overall. </p>

<p>GIANTX are now set to play <span data-ref-id="11">
