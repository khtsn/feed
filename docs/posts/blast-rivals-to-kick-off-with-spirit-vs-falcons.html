</span> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/574584/bbl-pcific-vs-dnsty-vct-2025-emea-ascension-sf/?game=all&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">3-1</a> and earning the final regional Ascension slot for VCT 2026. With this win, two Turkish teams have ascended into VCT EMEA, showing the region&#39;s talent in tier two.</p>

<p>DNSTY picked Lotus and Sunset, while BBL picked Abyss and Corrode, leaving Ascent as the potential final map in this five-map series.</p>

<p>Starting on Lotus, BCF ran a double-Duelist composition with Yoru and Raze, while DNSTY opted for double-Controller with Viper and Omen. BCF won the first pistol round, followed by a flawless antieco but a failed bonus round conversion. Despite that round loss, BCF was in complete control, highlighted by some great movement by <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/31305/lar0k">
		Lar0k	</a>
</span> leading to four kills.</p>


<p><em>Lar0k dances his way to four kills.</em></p>

<p>The lead extended to 7-1 before DNSTY won a second round on the attack side. A round win for DNSTY led by <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/16209/famsii">
		Famsii	</a>
</span> did prevent the half from spiraling away, as BBL PCIFIC entered the half up 8-4.</p>

<p>DNSTY won the second pistol to regain some needed momentum if the team wanted to start the comeback. In a 1v1 clutch on the bonus round, <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/8226/waddle">
		waddle	</a>
</span> won the duel with a Classic right click, which led to an 8-8 tie. Famsii won a 2v3 off of some smart utility and awareness, giving DNSTY its first lead of the series. <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/33994/creamydreamy">
		Creamydreamy	</a>
</span> won another clutch with his Viper&#39;s Pit to further the lead on the defense half, and BBL PCIFIC already used both timeouts, leading to no input from its coaching staff available to prevent this comeback. It took a tense post-plant from BCF to finally earn a round win on the attack side, and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/24344/loita">
		Loita	</a>
</span> pulled the map back to a 10-10 tie. </p>

<p>DNSTY pulled together to win a thrifty round afterward, and when <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/12474/tag">
		Tag	</a>
</span> pushed aggressively to win a 2v2, the map was effectively over. The defense from DNSTY was near perfect as they won the map 13-10 to take the first map win of the series.</p>

<p>Abyss was the second map of the series, with BCF running double-Duelist with Jett and Yoru, as DNSTY ran double-Initiator with KAY/O and Sova. BCF won the first pistol, but lost the antieco after some clever aggression from Famsii on Waylay. The rounds were traded back and forth early on, as BCF won a thrifty of its own soon after. Towards the end of the first half, <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/40935/lovers-rock">
		lovers rock	</a>
</span> started to heat up on the Operator, and Loita shut DNSTY down as BCF entered halftime up 8-4.</p>


<p><em>Loita holds his ground when DNSTY pushes him at the end of the first half on Abyss.</em></p>

<p>BCF won the second pistol of the map, and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/12795/crewen">
		Crewen	</a>
</span> outsmarted his opponents in a 1v2 clutch to convert the bonus round. He also got four kills on the final round, closing out Abyss 13-4 to tie the series 1-1.</p>

<p>Heading into Sunset tied, BCF kept running double-Duelist but introduced Neon for the first time in the series, while DNSTY ran a unique double-Controller comp with Viper, Omen, Deadlock, and Neon. A chaotic pistol round ended with an extremely close defuse from BCF, and DNSTY forced instead of saving on round two, which the team failed to convert. Loita and Lar0k were on fire, but as soon as DNSTY won a round and started to rebuild its economy, the map was tied 4-4 in what felt like seconds. The map looked primed to head towards the first close half of the game, but BCF once again caught fire as lovers rock used his Operator to lead his team to another 8-4 lead.</p>


<p><em>lovers rock nails four nice Operator shots to put BCF ahead on Sunset.</em></p>

<p>BCF won the second pistol on Sunset to continue the round win streak from the first half, but was unable to keep it up into the bonus round. DNSTY needed to fight back, and Famsii delivered with four kills in a round to force a timeout from BCF. An 11-5 lead disappeared, as <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/12519/ticey">
		Ticey	</a>
</span> and Creamy led DNSTY to 11-11. Just as it looked like BCF would choke the map away, Lar0k and Crewen both got double kills, and lovers rock nailed an unbelievable clutch with all of Yoru&#39;s utility to recover the map 13-11 as BCF took a 2-1 series lead.</p>

<p>On Corrode, BCF finally swapped off the double-Duelist, instead running double-Controller with Viper and Omen, while DNSTY ran a double-Initiator comp with Waylay as the duelist. DNSTY won the first pistol but was unable to convert the bonus to start the fourth map. Even then, they started the defense side well, before BCF was led by Crewen to another early game tie. Afterward, BCF chained together more round wins and reached the fourth straight 8-4 lead. </p>

<p>DNSTY won the pistol round, but BCF won a confident round to prevent the bonus. That was when Rosé came online, using the Odin and taking BCF to match point. Up 12-6, DNSTY had six chances to try and take the map to overtime, and it only took a couple of rounds before it was all over. BBL PCIFIC won Corrode 13-8 and the series 3-1, securing its spot in VCT 2026.</p>
