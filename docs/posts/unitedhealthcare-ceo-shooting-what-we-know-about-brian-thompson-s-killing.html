outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel early Wednesday remained at large more than 36 hours later, as details slowly emerged about his methods and whereabouts before the shooting.</p><p>Despite an intense citywide manhunt, the suspect’s name remained unknown on Thursday evening, two law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said. Even so, the police managed to trace his arrival in New York about 10 days before the shooting, some of his movements in those days and his route immediately before and after the killing. A picture began to emerge of the suspect as a shrewd and elusive operator.</p><h2 id="link-7eda07d9">When did the gunman arrive in Manhattan?</h2><p>The suspect appears to have arrived in Manhattan 10 days before the shooting, on Nov. 24, a senior law enforcement official said. He came on a bus that originated somewhere south of the city and checked into the HI New York City Hostel on Amsterdam Avenue near 104th Street in Manhattan. He checked out on Nov. 29, then checked back in the next day, the official said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>When he returned, on Nov. 30, the shooter used a fake New Jersey identification to book a room, the senior law enforcement official said. On Thursday, the police released two surveillance stills of the man who is believed to be the shooter with his mask down. The photos appear to have been taken at the hostel, where he had shared a room with two strangers, the senior law enforcement official said. It remains unclear when the photos were taken.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>New York police officers exiting the HI New York City Hostel, where the suspect stayed, in Manhattan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caitlin Ochs for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-f884aae">Why is it taking so long to catch him?</h2><p>Mr. Thompson was gunned down in one of the busiest and most intensely surveilled neighborhoods in the country, during an especially busy season for shoppers and tourists. The Police Department has years of experience using images from surveillance cameras and drones to find and capture criminals. The department dispatched scores of officers and detectives, dogs and drones to search the city and to research tips, which arrived from all over the country.</p><p>Mayor Eric Adams, appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” said Thursday that he believed investigators were on the right path and were “going to apprehend this person.”</p><p>So how has the gunman so far eluded identification, much less capture?</p><p>Part of the reason appears to be that he was camera-savvy, as the senior law enforcement official said. By Thursday evening, investigators had not found a surveillance image where the suspect’s face was entirely unobscured, the official said. Even in the pictures released Thursday, the suspect was wearing a hood.</p><p>The gunman’s apparent getaway route, cycling north into Central Park, also may have helped him because the park has many areas with no cameras.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The shooter may also be lucky. Investigators believe he may have dropped a water bottle at the scene, and a fingerprint was found on the bottle, the senior law enforcement official said. But the print was smudged, making it useless in identifying the man. Investigators are examining whether a cellphone left near the scene belonged to the gunman and was not a decoy or a so-called burner phone, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation. The police have not yet gained access to the device.</p><h2 id="link-2f293513">Why are the shell casings a crucial clue?</h2><p>Despite his elusiveness, the shooter may have left behind two revealing clues. Bullet casings found at the scene appear to have had the words “delay” and “deny” on them, according to two law enforcement officials.</p><p>Those words may have been a message related to “Delay, Deny, Defend,” the title of a book that discusses how health insurance companies avoid paying patients’ claims. The book, by Jay M. Feinman, a professor emeritus at Rutgers Law School, was published in 2010.</p><p>The discovery led the police to think the shooter may have been a former employee or client of UnitedHealthcare, or possibly a conspiracy theorist, the senior law enforcement official said.</p><p>Investigators were looking into the purchase in Connecticut of a gun that resembled the weapon used in the shooting, according to two officials briefed on the investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-8"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>1:11</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>UnitedHealthcare C.E.O.
