Federal law prohibits the president from directing the I.R.S. to investigate specific organizations, but Trump’s threat was nevertheless a dramatic escalation in the feud between the government and the nation’s richest and oldest university.</p><p>Just yesterday, the Trump administration announced that it would freeze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard after the school rebuffed a series of changes to its policies and curriculum.</p><p>The administration has threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding from colleges and universities over diversity hiring practices and tolerance of anti-Israel protests on campuses which have sometimes included antisemitic behavior. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">These seven schools</a> have been singled out for punitive funding cuts or notified that their funding is in jeopardy.</p><p>Critics of Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/harvard-trump.html" title="">cheered Harvard’s resistance</a> as an example for other institutions to follow. Harvard would face a significant financial burden if it lost its tax exempt status, but is uniquely positioned to withstand a showdown with the government because of its endowment of more than $50 billion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Columbia University, which last month agreed to major concessions the government had demanded, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/nyregion/columbia-trump-president-response.html" title="">changed its tune today</a>. Its new acting president announced that the school would reject any deal that erodes its independence.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Internal Revenue Service in Washington.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-498fadea">It’s Tax Day and the I.R.S. is downsizing</h2><p>About 22,000 employees at the Internal Revenue Service have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/irs-resignations-trump.html" title="">signed up for the Trump administration’s latest resignation offer</a>. Together with earlier departures, including thousands of layoffs that have been contested in court, the tax agency is on track to lose about a third of its work force this year.</p><p>The cuts have already caused the I.R.S. to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/irs-taxes-trump-musk-federal-workers.html" title="">abandon some audits</a>. And the staff reductions are expected to decrease the amount of revenue the federal government is able to collect, in part because taxpayers may feel more emboldened to try to avoid paying taxes if the I.R.S. is diminished.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The site where two missiles struck on Palm Sunday in Sumy, Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-4474d82a">Many Ukrainians have little hope of a cease-fire</h2><p>The war in Ukraine has continued, despite Trump’s push for a truce.

The overwhelming feeling there is one of fear, ceaseless tension and frayed nerves.

People come from afar to trace the tortured painter’s last footsteps. But since 2020, when art experts identified his final work as “Tree Roots,” there has been strife in the town.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/europe/van-gogh-tree-roots-france-auvers-sur-oise.html" title="">The main tree root depicted in the painting</a> — that of a black locust tree, dubbed the “elephant” by enthusiasts — abuts a public road. The village’s mayor has been fighting the property owners in court over who is in control of it. So far, the property owners, who have set up a website and non-profit organization for the tree roots, are winning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-379f08de">How an anime master perfected the ‘cool guy’ protagonist</h2><p>Television shows made by Shinichiro Watanabe have helped define contemporary anime.</p><p>His work, including the renowned “Cowboy Bebop,” is known for thrilling fight scenes, propulsive musical scores and fun, unpredictable characters.
