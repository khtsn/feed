Federal law prohibits the president from directing the I.R.S. to investigate specific organizations, but Trump’s threat was nevertheless a dramatic escalation in the feud between the government and the nation’s richest and oldest university.</p><p>Just yesterday, the Trump administration announced that it would freeze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard after the school rebuffed a series of changes to its policies and curriculum.</p><p>The administration has threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding from colleges and universities over diversity hiring practices and tolerance of anti-Israel protests on campuses which have sometimes included antisemitic behavior. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">These seven schools</a> have been singled out for punitive funding cuts or notified that their funding is in jeopardy.</p><p>Critics of Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/harvard-trump.html" title="">cheered Harvard’s resistance</a> as an example for other institutions to follow. Harvard would face a significant financial burden if it lost its tax exempt status, but is uniquely positioned to withstand a showdown with the government because of its endowment of more than $50 billion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Columbia University, which last month agreed to major concessions the government had demanded, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/nyregion/columbia-trump-president-response.html" title="">changed its tune today</a>.
