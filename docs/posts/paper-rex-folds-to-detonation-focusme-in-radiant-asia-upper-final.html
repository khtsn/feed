Hernández" title="Javier C.

As opera’s defining diva and one of the greatest performers of the 20th century, she is omnipresent in our culture, nearly 50 years after she died.</p><p>Now Callas is the subject of “Maria,” a film starring Angelina Jolie, which opened this week in select theaters and goes to Netflix on Dec. 11.</p><p>“You’ve been hearing Maria your whole life,” Jolie told me. “You just didn’t know it was her.”</p><p>As The Times’s classical music reporter, I wanted to understand how a Hollywood A-lister prepared to play an opera star. So I invited Jolie to the Metropolitan Opera in New York one recent night for a performance of Puccini’s “Tosca,” a signature opera for Callas. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/arts/music/angelina-jolie-met-maria-callas.html" title="">You can read my story about the experience here</a>.</p><p>Jolie’s every move is tracked by the tabloids, especially since her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/fashion/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce.html" title="">2016 divorce</a> from Brad Pitt, which is still playing out in court. She at times seemed uncomfortable with my questions. But she spoke candidly about living in the spotlight; the loneliness she sometimes feels; and why she took seven months of voice lessons for “Maria,” which is directed by Pablo Larraín.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll tell you more about Callas and examine the parallels between Callas and Jolie.</p><h2 id="link-44200eb4">La Divina</h2><p>Callas was born in New York to Greek immigrants in 1923, and became renowned for her silky voice and her ability to give her characters the nuances of real people. Known as La Divina to her admirers, she inspired cultish devotion, and fans would sometimes wait in line for days to get tickets for her performances.</p><p>Callas’s personal life also drew attention, particularly her relationship with the shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. He went on to marry Jackie Kennedy, leaving Callas bereft.</p><p>In her late 30s, Callas’s voice began to deteriorate. She canceled performances more often and started to retreat from the stage. In 1977, when she was just 53, she died of a heart attack, with only her housekeeper and butler nearby. By that point, her best singing days were already two decades behind her.</p><h2 id="link-49922152">A kindred spirit</h2><p>Jolie told me that she found a kindred spirit in the singer. Callas, too, was exalted and scorned by critics and fans. Her personal life was examined, interrogated and written about. And she, too, was described as intense and elusive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I was very moved by the amount she had to fight in her life,” Jolie told me.</p><p>In preparing for “Maria,” Jolie watched old interviews of Callas. She was dismayed to see an artist of her caliber asked about her personal life. Jolie was bothered in particular by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJaWeRm1YcA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“60 Minutes” interview</a> that aired in 1974. Mike Wallace asks Callas at one point, “You mean you’re a man-eater?”</p><p>Larraín, the director, told me that both Callas and Jolie had an instinct for mystery. They both knew when to let people in and when to push them out, he said.</p><p>“She opens the gate for you to understand and feel what she’s feeling,” he said of Jolie. “And then, out of nowhere, she’s out. And you cannot enter again. And then you wonder.”</p><h2 id="link-23539509">Callas’s legacy</h2><p>Callas can often seem like a mythical, larger-than-life, figure. Her career was preciously short, and most people know her only through recordings, photos and videos.</p><p>Yet she is still a towering figure in music. In the opera world, no one has been able to match the power of her voice, her captivating stage presence and her ability to connect with the public.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Jolie said she hoped “Maria” would help bring more people to opera — and to Callas.</p><p>“Her music is in the air; it’s a part of the fabric of society,” Jolie said. “An artist is someone who studies life. And she lived fully and truthfully.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/arts/music/angelina-jolie-met-maria-callas.html" title="">Read our story about Jolie’s night at the opera</a>.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-51e2f62f">Politics</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kash Patel</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><ul><li><p>Donald Trump said he will nominate Kash Patel, a loyalist with little law enforcement experience, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/trump-replace-christopher-wray.html" title="">as F.B.I. director</a>.

Hudson, a local Coast Guard swimmer in training, swoops in to save Allie, a wealthy young ballerina, from a sinking rowboat. Metaphors and plot twists abound as Yarros’s story bobs neatly into the future. A decade later, her star-crossed characters land back where they started, for different and equally complicated reasons. The question of whether they’ll find their way back to one another is a fun one to ponder over a slice of leftover pie.</p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>Here are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/26/books/notable-books.html" title="">100 Notable Books from 2024</a>, selected by the staff of the Book Review.
