How have you been?” But when Alex LaMond’s phone lights up with texts from her Brooklyn neighbors, she knows what’s coming.</p><p>Quickly, the conversations turn to chickens.</p><p>They ask after Agnes and Charlene and the other hens that jut across the brightly colored coop in the community garden where Ms. LaMond volunteers. And then comes the real point of the texts: eggs.</p><p>“Do you have any extra?” she said the neighbors ask. “People try anything they can to get the eggs.”</p><p>Across the United States, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/health/bird-flu-airborne-covid.html" title="">the spread of bird flu</a> has sent egg prices that were already high soaring. The culling of flocks and subsequent grocery store and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/business/high-egg-prices-restaurants.html" title="">restaurant price markups</a> on eggs have exasperated shoppers. In New York City, the egg shortage has injected a particular kind of chaos among the miles of sidewalks where supply is unreliable and prices vary wildly block to block.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a city that values local knowledge and exclusivity, a new kind of power structure is emerging for anyone who has eggs or knows where to get them cheap, or even at all.</p><p>Signs of this dynamic were evident on a recent day at one Manhattan grocery store, where a worker passed the empty egg shelves, reached into her smock and handed a favorite customer a full carton.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Compare Foods in the Bronx is well-stocked for the moment, but probably not for too long. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Elsewhere in the city, shoppers faced a more hectic scene.</p><p>Many grocery stores have posted handwritten signs explaining the limits they have put on the number of cartons a shopper can buy: three per customer at some; just one each at others. Cartons that are stocked early in the morning on shelves at the Trader Joe’s in Chelsea are sold out by the afternoon. A sign at the Park Slope Food Coop in Brooklyn chides customers to stop cutting cartons in half to avoid paying for a full dozen. Some bodegas and food trucks are charging an extra dollar for a New York staple, the egg sandwich.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In Manhattan’s Chinatown last week, a vendor was selling eggs from crates stacked inside a shopping cart.

On the counter were plastic bags, each stuffed with three eggs, on sale for $2.99 a baggie.</p><p>“You try to buy a half-carton, but this is way better,” Ms. Knight said.</p><p>The deli started selling the “loosies,” a term usually reserved for the individual cigarettes some bodegas sell under the counter, after the manager saw customers suffering sticker shock.</p><p>“They come in buy a loaf of bread and gallon of milk, and it’s nearly $13,” the manager, Luis Colon, said. “Every day, it’s getting more expensive.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>At Mr. Colon’s deli, where Christmas lights twinkle over the counter and shelves are stuffed with potato chips and canned vegetables, a $12.99 carton of a dozen eggs is one of the most expensive items, topped only by cat litter and a pack of cigarettes.

She had gone there for a $7.99 carton so that after a month of avoiding cooking with eggs, she could finally make honey cornbread.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At a Whole Foods in Harlem, a few dozen cartons of eggs remained on shelves normally loaded with hundreds on a recent afternoon.

Michael Ray Robinov, the chief executive, said he had to limit customers to four dozen apiece after he started to get orders for 12 or even 15 dozen eggs.</p><p>“New customers are coming in, and they are like panic-buying,” he said.</p><p>An array of eggs — large, jumbo, brown and white — were on the shelves at Compare Foods, on Boston Road near 166th Street in the Bronx last week, selling for up to $15.99 a dozen. One brand of white eggs priced at $7.95 was marked “limit one per family.”</p><p>“I do the best I can,” Luis Hernandez, the general manager, said. “I want to make money, but if people stop buying eggs it hurts my business.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>There are 16 screens at the front of the store to watch for shoplifting. If employees catch anyone stealing eggs, they have a tested method for discouraging future thefts, Mr. Hernandez explained, before telling a story about how he and his brother had once caught an egg thief who happened to be a family friend.</p><p>Mr. Hernandez’s brother spotted the theft on camera and approached the man, giving him a giant, egg-smashing bear hug.</p><p>“They broke all over his body,” Mr. Hernandez said, giggling so hard he could barely talk. “We still laugh about that.”</p><p>Graham Dickie<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Dionne Searcey is a Times reporter who writes about wealth and power in New York and beyond.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dionne-searcey">More about Dionne Searcey</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Ashley Southall writes about cannabis legalization in New York.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ashley-southall">More about Ashley Southall</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/24/nyregion/egg-shortage-prices-new-york-city.html">13</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/24/nyregion/egg-shortage-prices-new-york-city.html">13</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Bird Flu</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>New York Live Bird Markets:</strong> All live bird markets in New York City and in several nearby counties <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/nyregion/nyc-bird-flu-markets.html">must close temporarily in hopes of curbing the spread of bird flu</a>, which was detected at some of the markets in the past week, Gov.
