The Cowboys have played a home game on that day all but two years since 1966, and the Lions’ streak goes back uninterrupted to 1945.</p><p>People in Detroit or Dallas don’t celebrate the holiday with any more gusto than other Americans. There is nothing particularly turkey-like about a lion or a cowboy. So how did it come to pass that Thanksgiving in America became synonymous with two particular football teams?</p><h2 id="link-21743db9">Origins in the Leatherhead Era</h2><p>Professional football has been played on Thanksgiving since before the N.F.L. got its name; the league was initially saddled with the name American Professional Football Association.</p><p>There were six Thanksgiving Day matchups in the inaugural season in 1920, with such mighty sides as the Dayton (Ohio) Triangles and the Rochester (N.Y.) Jeffersons hosting games.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Pro football was mostly a Midwestern thing then, far overshadowed by the college game, which also held many Thanksgiving Day games. The day after the 1920 games, The New York Times <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/11/26/issue.html" title="">sports report</a> breathed not a word on the A.P.F.A. action, but it did have headlines like “Cornell No Match for Pennsylvania” and “Hobart and Rochester Tie.” College football games had already been played on the holiday for decades by then, a tradition begun by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5082192/2023/11/23/thanksgiving-football-game-history-princeton-yale/" title="">Princeton and Yale</a> way back in 1876.</p><p>The pro league, renamed the N.F.L. in 1922, continued to hold Thanksgiving games, including matchups featuring teams like the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers that remain familiar to modern fans.</p><p>In 1925, Thanksgiving pro football came to Detroit when the Rock Island (Illinois) Independents defeated the Detroit … Panthers.</p><h2 id="link-2431acb0">The Lions Look for Fans</h2><p>The more familiar feline arrived in Detroit in 1934 when the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans picked up stakes and moved, becoming the Lions. The team was an immediate success on the field, winning its first 10 games. But the owner, George Richards, wanted to <a href="https://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/thanksgiving-and-the-nfl/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increase ticket sales</a> and thought a Thanksgiving game might do it.</p><p>It worked: The team, which got 12,000 fans for a typical Sunday game the previous week, drew 25,000 fans for the Thanksgiving game against the Bears. The Lions lost, though, 19-16.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Lions hosted four more Thanksgiving games, all against the Bears, and then stopped until after World War II. They resumed hosting games on the fourth Thursday in November in 1945, and have done so every year since.</p><p>Unfortunately for Lions fans, that 1934 loss was a sign of things to come. Despite all the home games, the Lions have a losing record overall on Thanksgiving, 37-45-2, including losing the last seven years. The team is 10-1 this year, though, and favored to beat the Bears by about 10 points. It will be the 20th Thanksgiving Day meeting between the division rivals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Detroit Lions fans tailgating on Thanksgiving Day in 2014.

Sure enough, more than 80,000 fans packed the Cotton Bowl that year. The Cowboys soon became one of the most popular teams in the league, even gaining the nickname America’s Team — so maybe the strategy worked.</p><p>The new <a href="https://talesfromtheamericanfootballleague.com/the-afls-thanksgiving-day-games/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Football League</a>, which would eventually merge with the N.F.L., also held a Thanksgiving game that year, giving fans three pro games in total. “The starting hours are so staggered that devotees can watch all three in their entirety — if their eyes hold out,” The Times wrote, clearly underestimating ocular stamina of the typical football fan. The A.F.L. went on to have two Thanksgiving games in its final three seasons, letting fans feast on four games for a time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dallas has continued to host a Thanksgiving game every year since, except in 1975 and 1977 when the struggling St. Louis Cardinals were given the slot in a league effort to boost the team’s fortunes.</p><p>The Cowboys have a 33-22-1 record on Thanksgiving and will be the slight favorite to improve it on Thursday against the New York Giants.</p><h2 id="link-22661c50">A Tradition Continues</h2><p>The Cowboys and Lions became the only hosts of the two N.F.L. Thanksgiving games until 2006, when the N.F.L. added a third game, which rotates through a different host each year. Typically the Lions play first (this year at 12:30 p.m. Eastern), then the Cowboys (4:30 p.m.), and the third game is in the evening.</p><p>This year the Green Bay Packers will host the Miami Dolphins at 8:20 p.m. The Packers have been a frequent opponent of the Lions, their rival, in Thanksgiving games in Detroit, but this is only their second time playing at home on the holiday since 1923.</p><p>The college menu has become smaller over time: There is only one major game on Thursday, Tulane vs. Memphis. But some high schools continue to play on Thanksgiving, often in rivalry games. Maybe there’s one near you.</p><p>Enjoy the action. If your eyes hold out.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victor-mather">More about Victor Mather</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Sports</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping professional, collegiate and amateur athletics.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The ‘Enhanced’ Olympics?: </strong>With a controversial plan to allow doping in a major athletic competition, the venture capitalist Aron D’Souza hopes to usher in an era of “superhumans.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/style/enhanced-games.html">There are several hurdles left to clear</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hitting Rock Bottom: </strong>The Jets and Giants are having seasons that fans would rather forget.
