    <h1>State Attorneys General Ask Courts to Preserve Biden-era Gun Control Measures</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than a dozen state attorneys general, all Democrats, asked on Thursday to join federal legal efforts to preserve two Biden-era gun control policies, a signal of partisan legal fights to come as President-elect Donald J. Trump returns to power.</p><p>The two policy shifts are different. One would require buyers at gun shows to undergo a background check, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/us/politics/biden-guns-background-checks.html" title="">a</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/us/politics/biden-guns-background-checks.html" title="">rule by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> that is almost sure to clash with the views of Mr. Trump, who promised in a campaign speech to the National Rifle Association to “roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment.” The other, to ban a kind of trigger that can make a semiautomatic weapon fire like a machine gun, is similar to a policy that Mr. Trump embraced in his first term when he banned so-called bump stocks, which achieve the same purpose.</p><p>But the intervention is the first sign that partisan legal fights are likely to begin on Day 1 of the Trump White House, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/opinion/democrats-trump-agenda.html" title="">the wishes of some Democratic politicians</a> who have called for a more cooperative stance toward the incoming administration after four years of incessant fighting in Mr. Trump’s first term.</p><p>“We know it’s a very real likelihood, based on what the president-elect has said, that his Justice Department won’t defend these rules,” Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin of New Jersey said in an interview, referring to Mr. Trump, who becomes president on Monday. “States like New Jersey will be harmed.”</p></div></div>
