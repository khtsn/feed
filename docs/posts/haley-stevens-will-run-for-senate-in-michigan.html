The open-seat contest, in one of the most closely divided states in the country, is likely to be a marquee race in 2026, as Democrats strain to regain control of the Senate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Stevens, a strong fund-raiser who is the chair of the center-left New Democrat Coalition Action Fund, will be seen as a centrist in the primary contest. A former chief of staff for the Obama administration’s auto task force, she is leaning into her support for manufacturing and the auto industry. And, speaking in her distinctive Michigan accent, she opened her announcement video by telling the story of her first car.</p><p>“That used Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, it meant more to me than just freedom,” Ms. Stevens said. “It meant I had a piece of Michigan. You know, the Michigan that helped build this country. The Michigan that shaped me. It’s not just what I sound like. It’s who I am.”</p><p>In Congress, Ms. Stevens has been a vocal supporter of Israel, and she has received considerable backing from major pro-Israel groups including AIPAC’s political arm, which has spent heavily in Democratic primaries. Support from that group, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/us/politics/aipac-israel-gaza-democrats-republicans.html" title="">lightning rod</a> in some Democratic circles, helped Ms. Stevens <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/aipac-backed-stevens-ousts-levin-in-race-seen-as-bellwether-on-us-israel-politics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defeat</a> former Representative Andy Levin, the more liberal candidate, in a primary in 2022.</p><p>Debates over Israel and the war in Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/michigan-harris-arab-muslim-jewish-voters.html" title="">tore apart</a> the Democratic Party over the last year and a half, and some Democrats worry that such issues will be particularly divisive in the party’s primary for Senate in Michigan.</p><p>The Middle East is an especially sensitive subject in the state, which is home to significant Arab American, Muslim and Jewish communities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Other Democrats believe that the primary contests next year will be defined above all by debates over how to fight back against the Trump administration.
