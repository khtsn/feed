Mr. Fogel acknowledged his 95-year-old mother, who had continued to push for his freedom.</p><p>“To me you look damn good,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Fogel, before taking him to see the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House residence. He criticized President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s administration for not making the release of Mr. Fogel happen earlier.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Biden administration officials said in December that they had sought to free Mr. Fogel in a series of prisoner swaps with Russia but had been unsuccessful. Those swaps led to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/europe/russia-gershkovich-prisoner-swap.html" title="">release in August last year</a> of high-profile prisoners including Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter wrongly accused of spying while working as a journalist, and the former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan.</p><p>Mr. Trump said he hoped the release of Mr. Fogel, a Pennsylvanian described by U.S. officials as part of an as-yet-revealed “exchange,” would be an initial step toward negotiating an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, indicated in an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/politics/marc-fogel-released-russia-trump/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview on CNN</a> on Tuesday that another American would be released on Wednesday but did not say from where or provide details.</p><p>On his platform, Truth Social, Mr. Trump posted a photo of Mr. Fogel after stepping off the private plane that brought him home, wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers knit hat and kissing the snow-covered ground.</p><p>The striking scene capped days of covert discussions. Mr. Fogel’s release was negotiated in recent days by Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, whose portfolio has expanded to include the war in Ukraine. Mr. Witkoff flew to Moscow on his private jet, which was picked up by a website that tracks such planes, as opposed to a government plane. Mr. Trump told reporters that was done to save the government money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Fogel had worked at the Anglo-American School of Moscow for almost 10 years, but was arrested at an airport in the city in August 2021. He was found to have been traveling with cannabis, which his lawyer has said was intended to alleviate back pain. Mr. Fogel was found guilty in June 2022 for supposedly engaging in “large-scale drug smuggling” and sentenced to 14 years at a labor camp.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent, reporting on the second, nonconsecutive term of Donald J.
