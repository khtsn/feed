At about 9 p.m., it collided with an Army helicopter carrying a crew of three.</p><p>It was unclear early Thursday whether there were any survivors. Rescue teams were searching the dark, frigid water.</p><p>Here is what to know about the crash.</p><h2 id="link-55081f58">The collision caused an explosion.</h2><p>The collision was apparently captured in a video from a live webcam operated by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is a few miles north of the crash site.</p><p>At 8:47 p.m. on the stream, two aircraft are seen hitting each other, resulting in an explosive fireball followed by a trail of smoke. Before the collision, the plane had been on approach to Runway 33 at Reagan Washington National Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/30/autossell/_3x2_H/_3x2_H-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/30/autossell/_3x2_H/_3x2_H-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/01/30/133354_1_29vid-reagan-airport-7063_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>EarthCam</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Multiple agencies in Washington said they had received calls about a plane crash above the Potomac at 8:53 p.m. Washington’s fire emergency department said the plane had crashed into the river.</p><h2 id="link-74c0bce6">Officials have not said whether anyone survived.</h2><p>The authorities had not given an official count of survivors or victims by early Thursday, as helicopters, police boats and divers massed in the water near the airport to respond to the crash.</p><p>With 64 people on board, the commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700, was nearly full. The helicopter, a Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk, had been operating out of Fort Belvoir in Virginia. An Army official could not confirm the status of the crew of three late Wednesday.</p><h2 id="link-49cd542b">Rescuers face challenging conditions.</h2><p>About 300 emergency responders were working in dangerous and “highly complex” conditions to find survivors or bodies, said John Donnelly, Washington’s fire chief. The dark, freezing and windy conditions heightened the challenge, as meteorologists warned of the risk of hypothermia.</p><p>The search and rescue effort was expected to take days, Mr. Donnelly said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
