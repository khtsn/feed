The agency has recently begun work with the Justice Department to seize illicit e-cigarettes that come in flavors that appeal to adolescents.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has emerged as a critic of agency funding, nearly half of which is paid by the drug, tobacco and medical device industries that the agency oversees.</p><p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization-charts/fda-overview-organization-chart" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers that the F.D.A. oversees include</a> the Center for Tobacco Products and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-123174b1">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</h2><p><a href="https://www.cms.gov/about-cms" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This agency operates Medicare and Medicaid</a>, overseeing the enrollment of millions of people in the programs and paying the bills for their health care.

In 2017, the Trump administration proposed folding the agency into the National Institutes of Health, an idea that Congress rejected. The agency oversees the <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/gam/updates/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Guideline Clearinghouse</a>, a federal database intended to help doctors answer almost any medical question. Created in the 1990s as part of a wider movement to better link the practice of medicine to sound scientific research, the database has been targeted by some Republicans who argue that it is redundant.</p><h2 id="link-627c0119">Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry</h2><p>This agency works to determine and prevent the human health effects of exposure to hazardous substances.
