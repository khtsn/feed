    <h1>Liam Payne’s Cause of Death, the 911 Call and More: What We Know</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A man who identified himself as the hotel desk manager said on the call that a guest who appeared to have excessively consumed drugs and alcohol was “breaking everything in the room.” The manager requested urgent assistance because the room had a balcony and hotel employees were “afraid he could do something that puts his life at risk.”</p><p>A spokesman for the Buenos Aires police said on Thursday that the guest was Payne, 31.</p><p>The local prosecutor’s office, which is investigating the death, <a href="https://www.fiscales.gob.ar/fiscalias/la-muerte-de-liam-james-payne-el-musico-fallecio-producto-de-politraumatismos-y-hemorragia-interna-y-externa/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that it appeared Payne was alone when he died. It said investigators found broken objects and furniture in his hotel room, as well as what appeared to be narcotics and alcohol. The results of toxicology tests will most likely not be made public for several weeks.</p><h2 id="link-336d02ee">An autopsy said Payne died of ‘multiple trauma.’</h2><p>In an autopsy performed a few hours after Payne’s death, forensic experts determined that he died from falling out of a window and that there were no signs of a third party being involved. It is not clear whether Payne intentionally jumped or accidentally fell from the third floor.</p><p>The autopsy report was submitted to the prosecutor’s office, which said it indicated that Payne died of “multiple trauma” and “internal and external bleeding” in the skull, chest and abdomen and limbs.</p><p>The prosecutor’s office indicated that, because of the position in which the body was discovered and the 25 injuries he sustained, officials presume that Payne did not try to protect himself from the fall and may have fallen into a state of unconsciousness.</p></div></div>
