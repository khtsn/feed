The ministry imposed stringent limits on exports of certain rare earth elements that are mined almost exclusively in China and are used in everything from electric cars to smart bombs.</p><p>The commerce ministry also announced it was beginning two trade investigations into American exports of medical imaging equipment — one of the few manufacturing categories in which the United States remains internationally competitive.</p><p>China’s General Administration of Customs said that it would halt chicken imports from some of America’s biggest exporters of agricultural commodities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Taken together, the measures released by three different government agencies within minutes showed that China has no intention of backing down in the trade war that Mr. Trump began this week with his own steep tariffs on imports from around the world.</p><p>China’s new tariffs will hit fewer goods than President Trump’s tariffs only because China sells far more to the United States than it buys. China bought $147.8 billion worth of American semiconductors, fossil fuels, agricultural goods and other products last year. It sold $426.9 billion worth of smartphones, furniture, toys and many other products.</p><p>But while President Trump’s tariffs exempted some large categories of imports, like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, the Chinese tariffs have no exemptions.</p><p>China’s Finance Ministry issued a statement strongly criticizing Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which will begin to take effect on Saturday and fully kick in next Wednesday. “This practice of the U.S. is not in line with international trade rules, seriously undermines China’s legitimate rights and interests, and is a typical unilateral bullying practice,” the ministry said.</p><p>The Chinese tariffs are scheduled to take effect next Thursday — 12 hours after the American tariffs take effect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><em>This is a developing story.
