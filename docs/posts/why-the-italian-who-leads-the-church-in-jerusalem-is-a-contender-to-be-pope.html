His long experience in a politically fraught region that is the cradle of three major religions — he was ordained in 1990, at the age of 25, and moved to Jerusalem that year — has also boosted his papal capital.</p><p>But Cardinal Pizzaballa is seen as a Vatican outsider, given that he has spent decades in the Middle East, rather than building alliances closer to home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some cardinals and other members of the Roman Catholic Church’s hierarchy are also concerned that Cardinal Pizzaballa, 60, may be too young for the job. Pope John Paul II was elected at 58 and served for 26 years. The prospect of another papacy lasting a quarter-century or more has given pause to some of the cardinals who will elect the next pope. </p><p>Cardinal Pizzaballa’s reverence for traditional elements of church practice has made him palatable to some conservatives. But after spending decades in the Middle East, he is something of a wild card, since his positions on many issues that have caused division in the church are not known.</p><p>What he does have, Vatican experts agree, is a personal touch as a church leader that Pope Francis valued.</p><p>“He embodies a pastoral approach,” said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology at Villanova University. “In Jerusalem, you deal with other religions that have strong opinions on these issues, so you have to not become a crusader in any possible sense of the word.”</p><p>Cardinal Pizzaballa “comes from a pragmatic Catholic culture,” Mr. Faggioli added. “He is not going to wage a culture war on sex- and gender-related issues.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The cardinal declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Cardinal Pizzaballa is credited with deftly navigating the Middle East’s politics and communities, speaking forcefully against injustice and hatred but also making friends among Jews, Muslims, Christians and other communities. Above all, he developed a reputation as someone willing to listen.</p><p>People who have worked closely with him in Jerusalem described him as a capable administrator and a humble leader with little time for pomp.</p><p>“He cares for the poor,” said Wadie Abunassar, the coordinator of the Forum of Holy Land Christians, a nongovernmental group of Christian laity in Israel. “He helps in a discreet way. He’s a person who likes to build bridges with every human being.”</p><p>When Hamas attacked Israel in 2023, the cardinal had been in his new role for only a few days, but he had spent 35 years in the region. A Franciscan ordained in northern Italy, he became a student of biblical theology in Jerusalem and ended up teaching biblical Hebrew. Alongside his native Italian and Hebrew, he speaks English but only limited Arabic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>His ability with languages and deft diplomacy came into use as he cared for Israel’s Hebrew-speaking Catholics, paying almost monthly visits to parishes. He has also visited the tiny Christian community in Gaza during the war there and has an open dialogue with Jewish Israelis.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cardinal Pizzaballa visiting Christians in Gaza City in December.

This drew a harsh rebuke from a member of the Israeli government.</p><p>In April, the cardinal traveled to Rome to talk to Francis to organize a meeting between him and rabbis concerned about the language he had used, according to Oded Wiener, a former director-general of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel who was responsible for interfaith relations and the rabbinate’s relations with the Vatican.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A date was set for the meeting, but it did not happen, first for technical reasons and then because of the decline in Francis’ health, Mr. Wiener said. It was not clear to what extent the cardinal personally sympathized with the concerns of the rabbis.</p><p>In Francis’ <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/urbi/documents/20250420-urbi-et-orbi-pasqua.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">final address</a>, delivered the day before he died, the pope said that the growing climate of antisemitism around the world was “worrying,” and he also denounced Gaza’s “deplorable humanitarian situation.”</p><p>Patrick Kingsley<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and <!-- -->Emma Bubola<!-- --> from Rome.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.</p></div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Contenders to Be the Next Pope</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Pietro Parolin:</strong> Cardinals have talked about Cardinal Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, as someone who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/pope-conclave-cardinal-pietro-parolin.html">could have a steady, bureaucratic hand</a> on the church’s wheel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Luis Tagle:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/luis-tagle-asian-pope.html">Known as the “Asian Francis”</a>, Cardinal Tagle of the Philippines is considered to be a contender in the mold of Francis, but has been criticized for not being vocal enough about his country’s brutal drug war and clerical sex abuse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Matteo Zuppi: </strong>Cardinal Zuppi of Italy has worked with the needy and the disenfranchised, even as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/matteo-zuppi-pope-bologna.html">participated in peace talks around the world</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robert Francis Prevost:</strong> As ideological camps tussle over whether to continue Pope Francis’ inclusive agenda or return to a conservative doctrinal path, supporters of Cardinal Prevost — a native of Chicago who has spent the bulk of his career outside the country — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/americas/pope-candidate-cardinal-robert-francis-prevost.html">pitch him as a balanced alternative</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jean-Marc Aveline</strong><strong>:</strong> From Marseille, France, Cardinal Aveline has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/europe/aveline-pope-conclave-contender.html">spent a large part of his career promoting conversations between different faiths in the city</a>, a port city at the confluence of diverse cultures and religions that is also plagued by poverty and crime.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
