Mr. Trump said he was ending the sanctions, many of which had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/middleeast/syria-economy-trump-sanctions.html" title="">imposed on Syria’s previous government</a>, “to give them a chance at greatness.”</p><p>In doing so, Mr. Trump was effectively shrugging off the views of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government calls Mr. al-Shara a “jihadist.” Israel’s military has bombed Syria <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/middleeast/israel-syria-druse-strikes.html" title="">hundreds of times since December</a>, when rebels led by Mr. al-Shara ousted President Bashar al-Assad from power.</p><p>In recent decades, under U.S. presidents from both parties, Israel has largely enjoyed a special place at the center of American foreign policy in the region. Mr. Netanyahu, who has been in power for much of the past two decades, was always an essential player in the Middle East debate, even as he sometimes infuriated his American counterparts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There is no indication that the United States is abandoning its historic ties with Israel, or will stop its military and economic support for the country. During his flight on Air Force One from Riyadh to Doha, Mr. Trump dismissed concerns about sidelining Israel.</p><p>“No not at all,” he told reporters. “This is good for Israel, having a relationship like I have with these countries, Middle Eastern countries, essentially all of them.”</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s five-day tour through the Middle East this week underscored a new dynamic, one in which Israel — and Mr. Netanyahu, in particular — is something of an afterthought. In Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump has sought to negotiate peace deals in Iran and Yemen and cut trillion-dollar business deals with the wealthy nations of the Persian Gulf.</p><p>He did not make a stop in Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Trump in the Oval Office in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“The overall sense is of shifting attention and perception of interest, mainly to the Gulf States, where the money is,” said Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Rabinovich said that Mr. Trump appears to have lost much of his interest in working with Mr. Netanyahu to resolve the war in Gaza, because of “a sense that there’s no point. Netanyahu has his position, he doesn’t move from it. Hamas doesn’t move from its position. It seems like a hopeless stalemate.”</p><p>Omer Dostri, Mr. Netanyahu’s spokesman, denied any serious rift in relations between the two countries, citing Mr. Netanyahu’s two visits to the White House in the last several months and Mr. Trump’s recent comment that “we are on the same side on every issue,” referring to the Israeli prime minister.</p><p>But the change in diplomatic fortunes has been hard to miss during the last few weeks, as Mr. Trump took action on one issue after another — without involving Mr. Netanyahu.</p><p>Earlier this month, Mr. Trump surprised many in Israel by abruptly announcing a cease-fire with the Houthi militants in Yemen, even as the group continued to fire missiles into Israel. When Israel failed to intercept one missile, it struck the Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, disrupting flights for weeks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Israeli security services inspecting a crater near Ben Gurion Airport this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Days later, the Trump administration secured the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage in Gaza, without Israel’s involvement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Nadav Shtrauchler, a former adviser to Mr. Netanyahu, said that the prime minister still has a relationship with Mr. Trump, but it is different from the one he has had with previous American presidents.</p><p>“With Biden, Netanyahu could postpone decisions,” he said. “In Trump’s case, as soon as that happens, the decisions are made over Netanyahu’s head. This is a change that worries many people in Israel.”</p><p>Throughout his Middle East visit, Mr. Trump has repeated his desire for a deal with Iran that would avoid the need to use military force against its nuclear facilities. In Qatar on Thursday, he said the United States was in “very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” adding that it would be “fantastic” if they reached a deal.</p><p>That is also the opposite of what Mr. Netanyahu has said he wanted. The Israeli prime minister has urged the Trump administration to support, or even participate in, military strikes against Iran. So far, Mr. Trump has gone the other way, though he has repeatedly held open the possibility of large-scale strikes if negotiations fail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“More than anything else, the heart of the story is Iran,” Mr. Shtrauchler said. “Netanyahu’s legacy is at stake.”</p><p>The decision on how to deal with Iran is not unlike the president’s decision to lift sanctions on Syria. There is deep suspicion in Israel that Mr. al-Shara’s new government will turn out to be another anti-Israel, extremist force. Israeli officials say the strikes are meant to destroy the weapons from the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which Mr. al-Shara overthrew, and limit its presence near Israel’s northern border.</p><p>By contrast, Mr. Trump’s announcement about sanctions is an endorsement of Mr. al-Shara’s promises to be different, and will throw him a desperately needed economic lifeline.</p><p>Taken together, the president’s actions are a stunning turnaround, even from Mr. Trump’s own first term, when he visited Israel during his first foreign trip abroad. One of his first official acts on that trip was to announce that the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a symbolic show of solidarity with Mr. Netanyahu by his side.</p><p>The shift has shaken Israelis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump at the Yad Vashem memorial to the Holocaust in Jerusalem in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephen Crowley/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Reports in Israeli newspapers and international headlines blared the hand wringing: “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/bypassed-by-trump-israel-dismayed-silent-2025-05-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bypassed by Trump, Israel dismayed but silent</a>”; “<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-14/ty-article/.premium/trumps-snubs-what-netanyahus-declining-global-prowess-means-for-his-fortunes-at-home/00000196-cdf7-d048-a7d7-ddf7788e0000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump’s Snubs: What Netanyahu’s Declining Global Prowess Means for His Fortunes at Home</a>”; “<a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/05/11/visited-700-times-white-house-signals-fatigue-with-netanyahu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">White House signals fatigue with Netanyahu</a>”; “<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/middleeast/israel-trump-middle-east-intl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump’s Middle East trip leaves Netanyahu watching from the sidelines again</a>.”</p><p>For now, Mr. Trump appears unlikely to reverse course, even as his aides insist that his relationship with Mr. Netanyahu remains strong. The president is no longer treating Israel like the indispensable nation in the Middle East or the lone democracy in a sea of autocracy.</p><p>Militarily, the United States relies on vast bases in Saudi Arabia and Qatar to project force in the region, including the sprawling Al Udeid Air Base just outside of Doha. Mr. Trump has sought to deepen relations with Turkey, a NATO member that has harshly criticized Israel’s war in Gaza, which have escalated to personal insults between Mr. Netanyahu and the Turkish president.</p><p>Economically, Mr. Trump views the Gulf nations as reliable — and reliably wealthy — places to do business. Mr. Trump wants Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords in a normalization deal with Israel but appears to have recognized it will not happen while the war in Gaza is still raging. Instead, he has focused on business deals with the crown prince.</p><p>In a speech in Riyadh on Tuesday, Mr. Trump heralded the “bright future of the Middle East” and praised the leaders of “a modern and rising” region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump meeting with President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, in a photo released by the Saudi Royal Palace.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bandar Al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Palace</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“A new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient conflicts of tired divisions of the past and forging a future,” he said, “where people of different nations, religions, and creeds are building cities together, not bombing each other out of existence.”</p><p>He mentioned Israel only in passing. Instead, he focused on the Gulf leaders who vastly expanded what he called the “gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi” over the past decade. The focus of the speech, and its tone, was a dramatic shift from those delivered by his predecessors.</p><p>For Israel, and for Mr. Netanyahu, that shift carries long-term implications. But so far, the prime minister has shown little interest in shifting his approach to governing or his conduct of his country’s conflicts with Hamas, Iran, Syria or Yemen.</p><p>Even as Mr. Trump traveled through the Gulf, promising a new future in the region, Israeli forces intensified their attacks in Gaza with a fierce strike aimed at a senior Hamas leader and a response to missile attacks that killed dozens of Palestinians near the northern Gaza city of Jabaliya.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>In comments during the trip, Mr. Trump acknowledged the threat of starvation in Gaza, even as the Israeli political leadership, including Mr. Netanyahu, have downplayed that concern.<span>  </span>But for the most part, the president’s main focus throughout the trip was elsewhere.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians mourning the victim of a strike in Jabaliya on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Jonathan Swan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
