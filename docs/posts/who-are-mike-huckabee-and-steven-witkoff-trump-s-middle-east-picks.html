There’s no such thing as an occupation.”</p><p>Israeli opponents of Palestinian statehood argue that giving land to Palestinians in the West Bank could pose a security threat to Israel in the future. Hard-liners in Israel’s settler community oppose conceding all or parts of the West Bank because they believe it was promised to Jews by God.</p><p>Earlier, during his 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Huckabee said in <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/andrewkaczynski/mike-huckabee-theres-really-no-such-thing-as-a-palestinian" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video published by BuzzFeed</a> that “there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian,” and that any independent Palestinian state should be defined within the boundaries of neighboring Arab states like Egypt, Syria or Jordan — not Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Huckabee’s nomination drew congratulations and words of welcome from a host of Israeli government officials.

It said Mr. Huckabee’s appointment “is further proof that ‘pro-Israel’ for Trump is totally disconnected from Jewish values, safety or self-determination.”</p><h2 id="link-7cc3db26">Steve Witkoff</h2><p>Mr. Witkoff, a real estate developer who has been a golf partner of the president-elect, was a donor to Mr. Trump’s political action committee and helped connect him to the entrepreneurs leading his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/technology/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html" title="">cryptocurrency venture</a>.</p><p>In May, when the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/politics/biden-bombs-israel.html" title="">paused the shipment</a> of 2,000-pound bombs, Mr. Witkoff used it as a fund-raising opportunity for Mr. Trump.
