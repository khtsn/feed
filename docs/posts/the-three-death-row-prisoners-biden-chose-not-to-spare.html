Trump, who carried out 13 executions during his first term, will have the remaining three men executed when he returns to office. And the Justice Department under Mr. Biden is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/nyregion/payton-gendron-buffalo-death-penalty.html" title="">pursuing the death penalty</a> against the gunman who carried out a racist mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., in 2022, seeking to add him to the small group of people that remain on federal death row.</p><p>Here are the men whom Mr. Biden chose not to spare.</p><p><strong>Dylann Roof</strong>, 30, was convicted of hate crimes in the killing of nine Black parishioners in a racist attack on a Charleston church in 2015.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A federal jury <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/dylann-roof-trial-charleston.html" title="">sentenced Mr. Roof to death in 2017</a>. He had admitted his guilt and offered to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison.</p><p>The Justice Department sought the death penalty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/us/death-penalty-dylann-roof-charleston.html" title="">over the objection</a> of survivors of the attack and many relatives of the victims.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Roof have challenged his conviction over concerns about his mental competency and his dealings with his lawyers, but those appeals have been rejected.</p><p>Mr. Roof is currently imprisoned at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., where the federal death row and the death chamber are housed.</p><p><strong>Robert Bowers</strong>, 52, was convicted of hate crimes in the killing of 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A federal jury decided last year that Mr. Bowers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-trial-robert-bowers.html" title="">would be sentenced to death</a> for what is considered the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history. His <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-death-sentence.html" title="">death sentence</a> was the first to be handed down during the Biden administration. Mr. Bowers had offered to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison but the government declined to make the deal.</p><p>Mr. Bowers had been armed with an AR-15 and three handguns when he stormed the synagogue and went after members of three congregations — Tree of Life, New Light and Dor Hadash — that had gathered in parts of the building for morning worship.</p><p>His lawyers had argued in court that he had schizophrenia and other mental problems and focused on his troubled childhood. But prosecutors disputed those arguments and focused on the planning he had done in the months before the attack and the antisemitic writings he had left online.</p><p>Most family members of the victims <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/us/tree-of-life-synagogue-death-penalty.html" title="">supported the government’s decision to seek the death penalty</a>, though some disagreed. Like Mr. Roof, Mr. Bowers is currently imprisoned at the federal prison in Terre Haute.</p><p><strong>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</strong>, 31, was convicted of helping to carry out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three spectators and wounded hundreds more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Tsarnaev, who planted the pressure cooker bombs used in the attack with his brother, Tamerlan, in retaliation for American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/us/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-death-sentence.html" title="">sentenced to death</a> by a federal jury in 2015.</p><p>In 2020, a federal court overturned his death sentence, but the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/us/politics/supreme-court-death-sentence-boston-marathon-bomber.html" title="">reinstated it in 2022</a>.</p><p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with the police during which he was also accidentally run over by his brother.</p><p>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being held at a federal prison in Florence, Colo.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reports on national stories across the United States with a focus on criminal justice.
