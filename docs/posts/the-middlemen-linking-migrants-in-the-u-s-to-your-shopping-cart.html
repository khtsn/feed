In the span of a year, its business reportedly doubled.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hidden from public view is the middleman role often played by staffing agencies. They recruit workers for warehouses, factories and distribution centers that serve up billions of dollars in goods for brand-name companies.</p><p>One of the most notorious agencies, BaronHR, worked with Alo Yoga and Bella+Canvas for years, including at the Nevada warehouse. The reporting shows that the agency’s founder, Luis E. Perez, cast himself as a benefactor for immigrant workers, but in many cases his firms cheated them out of wages and stole their tax payments.</p><p>While BaronHR provided jobs to migrants — and employees to companies — it was also an active player on the darker side of the immigration economy. Until the firm collapsed early this year, it was an agent for the exploitation of laborers who were often underpaid and working in unsafe conditions, all while shielding brands from direct responsibility.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>To examine this secretive world, The Times scoured thousands of pages of court records, internal corporate documents and regulatory filings, and interviewed 100 migrant employees, as well as regulators and industry experts.</p><p>Mr. Perez is now in jail awaiting sentencing after <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/owner-orange-county-staffing-companies-pleads-guilty-tax-crimes-admits-cheating-irs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pleading guilty</a> to federal tax crimes involving nearly $60 million. But since 2018, while his case went unresolved, records indicate that BaronHR and affiliated firms entered into contracts and collected more than $750 million from corporate partners, including Alo Yoga and Bella+Canvas. Much of the business occurred even as Mr. Trump cracked down on illegal immigration.</p><p>The privately held clothing retailers did not respond to repeated requests for comment, including a detailed list of findings addressed to their founders and hand-delivered to their Beverly Hills headquarters. A representative for Ms. Jenner, Ms. Ambrosio and Ms. Lopez declined to comment.</p><p>In a statement from jail in Santa Ana, Calif., Mr. Perez said, “There are significant limitations on my ability to meaningfully engage with you,” because of his legal situation and what he characterized as serious health problems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He said BaronHR was often an employer “in name only” because “clients dictated the employment terms and conditions” and that since 2018 he had had “restricted involvement.” Some of his detractors, he said, were “former disgruntled employees, competitors and less-than-ideal clients.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Luis E.

Over more than a decade, they provided staffing for at least 800 companies large and small, publicly traded and privately held, client lists and other records obtained by The Times show. In addition to Alo Yoga and Bella+Canvas, the companies included well-known giants like TJX — the parent of T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls — and Keurig Dr Pepper, the beverage maker.</p><p>Those records do not identify the workers’ legal status, but a former BaronHR manager, Stacy Mohler, said some companies were adamant about vetting workers, while others just wanted “a warm body.” Another former manager said word spreads quickly about staffing firms that “hire anyone.”</p><p>Staffing agencies were among the top employers of unauthorized workers at sites inspected for immigration violations over the past decade, according to data collected by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The records indicate that at least 160 staffing firms, most of them identified during the Trump administration, employed people with suspicious documents or no evidence of authorization.</p><p>Immigration experts say this pattern of hiring reflects a far broader phenomenon tracked in the Biden and Obama administrations as well, but staffing agencies contacted by The Times disputed the accuracy of the data or suggested that workers had misrepresented their status.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The industry group representing staffing firms says partners sometimes use them as scapegoats.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>BaronHR, which placed temporary workers at hundreds of companies, became known for wage theft and other violations. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Clients are constantly trying to shift responsibility to us,” said Ed Lenz, senior counsel of the American Staffing Association. (BaronHR was not a member.) “And it’s a chronic longstanding tussle that we have with clients because they’re trying to relieve themselves of as much responsibility as possible.”</p><p>Dozens of staffing agencies have been accused of violations at their partner companies’ work sites, including sexual harassment, racial discrimination, wage theft or safety lapses that resulted in amputations, crushed body parts and death.</p><p>Federal, state and local regulators have pursued at least 80 investigations of agencies over possible violations involving immigrants, including many who are in the United States illegally, according to records from the Department of Homeland Security obtained through public records requests. They were compiled during the Biden administration but document accusations stretching back at least as far as the Trump era. They do not indicate the status of the investigations, and a department spokesperson did not provide more information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Colombian worker who was placed at the sprawling Alo Yoga and Bella+Canvas warehouse in Nevada said that even check-cashing operations that were popular among undocumented immigrants often turned him away.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Three staffing firms, for example, are under investigation by the Illinois Labor Department for concerns related to improper training at Ferrara Candy, the maker of SweeTarts and Jelly Belly jelly beans.</p><p>The candy company is also under investigation, records show. In a statement, it described the investigation as “frivolous” and said “all temporary and full-time workers understand the hazards and appropriate safety measures of their assigned role.”</p><p>Interviews and regulatory records show that BaronHR and its affiliates have been the subject of at least three investigations involving discrimination or failure to pay workers assigned to dozens of job sites, including at TJX.</p><p>In a statement, TJX said it requires staffing partners to provide authorized workers. “As these individuals are Baron employees,” the company said, “it would be inappropriate for us to comment on BaronHR’s business practices.”</p><p>Mr. Perez, the BaronHR founder, described “the vast majority” of its workers as “rollover” employees who had been hired by another agency or already worked for the partner company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Across the country, BaronHR became known for issuing paychecks that shortchanged wages or bounced because of insufficient funds. The Times obtained BaronHR emails, interviewed employees and reviewed lawsuits describing more than a decade of payment problems.</p><p>A worker from Colombia said even check-cashing operations that were popular among undocumented immigrants often turned him away. “It was always a headache,” said the man, who worked at the Alo Yoga and Bella+Canvas warehouse in Nevada.</p><p>The retailers were among many companies that enlisted Mr. Perez’s services after he and his firms endured government raids, arrests, bankruptcies, indictments and lawsuits, according to interviews, BaronHR client records and court filings.</p><p>The relationships are a case study in how companies can benefit from illegal immigration — and can sidestep responsibility as workers are exploited.</p><p>In a sworn statement in May, the warehouse operations and safety manager for the two retailers said they had moved the BaronHR workers in California and Nevada to new staffing agencies and had paid missing wages. The intervention came after a work stoppage at the Nevada warehouse in January.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-109dec80">A ‘Game of Whac-a-Mole’</h2><p>Last year about 13 million people worked in temporary jobs, more than a third of which were in warehouses, distribution centers and other industrial settings, according to the American Staffing Association.</p><p>For many unauthorized migrants, staffing firms offer a way to get their footing. In interviews, some recounted that their first job at BaronHR felt like a godsend.</p><p>One man from El Salvador had earned $40 a day selling oranges in Los Angeles. When he later made his way to Nevada, BaronHR sent him to the Alo Yoga and Bella+Canvas warehouse for $17 an hour.</p><p>A woman who had fled violence in South America worked for two staffing agencies in New Jersey before BaronHR sent her to Pennsylvania. There, she said, she unloaded mannequins, clothes and store decorations for a center owned by TJX for $18 an hour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>While working for BaronHR, Elizeth Peláez had no home because her income was too unreliable to pay rent.

At first, she packed potato chips and vitamins for $10 an hour, and welded wires for casino machines for $11. Eventually, she said, she drove a forklift for $18 an hour.</p><p>But her BaronHR paychecks bounced so often, she couldn’t reliably make rent. She slept in an office at a building she cleaned on the side.</p><p>“You have to do what they ask,” she explained, “or you’re left with nothing.”</p><p>To find such compliant workers, BaronHR relied on social media platforms, like LinkedIn, and word of mouth. It posted fliers in laundromats and stores, and opened offices in immigrant neighborhoods.</p><p>For years, Mr. Perez also leveraged his cultural connections.</p><p>Born in Mexico and raised in Orange County, Calif., he focused recruitment on Southern California’s Hispanic population. In his statement, he emphasized his humble origins. “I am very familiar with the experience of immigrants struggling to make ends meet,” he said, “because I was one.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>BaronHR turned to LinkedIn and other social media to find workers.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>By 2003, his first firm, then called Checkmate Staffing, had hundreds of millions of dollars a year in business, Mr. Perez told government investigators, according to court records. Other disclosures showed that Checkmate workers were deployed to more than 1,200 companies.</p><p>Staffing agencies make money by charging companies a “markup” on hourly wages. Some find underhanded ways to gain a competitive edge. Mr. Perez could afford slim markups because he cut corners on required expenses such as workers’ compensation payments and payroll taxes, according to interviews and two decades of criminal cases against him.</p><p>Without providing details, Mr. Perez said in his statement that BaronHR relied on third-party contractors that “misled” the staffing agency about workers’ compensation coverage or withheld wages when “clients didn’t pay on time.”</p><p>David Weil, former administrator of the U.S. Labor Department’s wage and hour division, said operators like Mr. Perez go “in and out of business under multiple names,” skirting responsibility by creating a “game of Whac-a-Mole.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Workers, including a man from El Salvador who had previously sold oranges in Los Angeles for $40 a day, described feeling relieved and excited when they first got work through BaronHR.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>He added, “If you create an environment where essentially you’re allowing some businesses to compete on the basis of wage theft, it starts pulling down the standards.”</p><p>Mr. Lenz, of the Staffing Association, said that law-abiding firms feel “deeply frustrated” because “they’re being hammered in the marketplace.”</p><p>BaronHR and its affiliates flourished, eventually expanding into about 15 states. “We were making hundreds of placements every hour,” said Becky Romero, a former BaronHR executive vice president who has a pending sexual harassment and wrongful termination suit against the company.</p><h2 id="link-30f16879">‘Nothing Is Getting Fixed’</h2><p>BaronHR’s practices were hardly an industry secret.</p><p>Beginning over a decade ago, there were lawsuits, civil rights complaints and other public actions against the firm. And on multiple occasions, executives at a rival staffing agency emailed BaronHR clients about the problems. A person familiar with the emails said they went to more than 120 undisclosed partner companies.</p><p>One executive with the competitor, Partners Personnel, wrote in March 2021 that Mr. Perez’s run-ins with the law had the “potential to significantly disrupt your operations” and put “an unfortunate stain on the staffing industry.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Some BaronHR clients backed away as the agency’s troubles became more widely known, but hundreds remained steadfast.</p><p>When Keurig Dr Pepper signed a new contract with BaronHR in 2019 to staff a facility in California, Mr. Perez and two of his executives were facing state <a href="https://orangecountyda.org/press/three-defendants-charged-with-tax-fraud-and-workers-compensation-insurance-fraud-for-misrepresenting-employee-status-of-inju/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charges</a> for tax and workers’ compensation premium fraud.</p><p>Later that year, as federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/oc-business-owner-faces-tax-evasion-charge-related-nearly-30-million-owed-irs-payroll" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unsealed</a> an indictment charging Mr. Perez with not paying millions in payroll taxes, Keurig Dr Pepper expanded the partnership to include more warehouses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>BaronHR helped staff Alo Yoga and Bella+Canvas facilities, including a vast warehouse in Nevada.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>The partners then deepened their relationship with a national contract, according to a wrongful termination lawsuit by a former BaronHR employee.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Agency records show that workers were sent to Keurig Dr Pepper locations across the country, including manufacturing and warehouse sites in Florida and Illinois. Like the other BaronHR records reviewed by The Times, these do not indicate workers’ immigration status.</p><p>In a statement, Keurig Dr Pepper did not comment on the contract extensions but said it had later terminated its relationship with BaronHR because the firm was “not able to meet the standards expected in our internal vendor processes.”</p><p>The company added that it requires all suppliers to comply with the law and its ethical standards, including screening applicants for immigration status. It also said that it “did not observe any conduct” that ran counter to its standards.</p><p>Similarly, food affiliates of CJ Group maintained a relationship with BaronHR while they and the staffing firm faced worker lawsuits, records show.</p><p>The Times reached out to Schwan’s, which last year merged with the food affiliates and produces products under Red Baron, Bibigo and other brand names. In a statement, a Schwan’s spokesman acknowledged there had been “a handful of situations” when “BaronHR failed to pay workers,” but said “we always paid BaronHR for the work performed,” and “we expect the companies we work with to abide by all laws.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>In interviews, several former employees at BaronHR offices described workers from a variety of sites, including Alo Yoga and Bella+Canvas, complaining about missing wages and bounced paychecks. In some cases, they responded to calls from partner companies about why the workers were not getting paid.</p><p>Often, they said, they offered empty promises. But one recalled telling companies, “Nothing is getting fixed.”</p><p>In his statement, Mr. Perez said he accepted “ultimate responsibility” for his tax problems, while spreading blame to others.</p><p>“My downfall was hiring people with limited training and experience to run the business,” he said, “and retaining professionals who gave me very bad advice.”</p><h2 id="link-7fc6ed9b">‘U.S.A.

They are owned by Color Image Apparel, a privately held company based in Beverly Hills, founded by Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>The relationship with BaronHR dates back roughly a decade, when the staffing firm began supplying them workers in suburban Los Angeles, records and interviews show. They also indicate that BaronHR and the retailers were in close communication when problems arose in the Nevada warehouse. BaronHR and other firms providing staffing had representatives stationed in the lunchroom, according to workers and BaronHR corporate employees.</p><p>In September 2022, a new contract between Bella+Canvas and BaronHR laid out the agency’s responsibility for screening, hiring and paying workers. Over the previous three years, at least four workers had sued both BaronHR and Bella+Canvas over pay and other claims. Three settled and one, who also filed a discrimination complaint to California’s civil rights agency, has a lawsuit still pending.</p><p>The Times interviewed more than 20 people whom BaronHR had hired to work for Alo Yoga, Bella+Canvas, Color Image or their contractors. All of them were undocumented during their employment, and some shared texts, emails, pay stubs and other documents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-42"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eduardo Olmos and other former BaronHR workers described difficulties getting paid, including being sent to check-cashing stores that charged high fees.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><p>Many of the workers described banks rejecting their paychecks for insufficient funds.

He talked of sitting courtside at Lakers and Clippers games, partnering with the actor Mario Lopez on a production company, and rubbing elbows with Andy Garcia and other Hollywood celebrities. His company at the time, Checkmate, made Hispanic Magazine’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030042250/http://www.hispaniconline.com/pdf/entrepreneur100.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Entrepreneur 100” list</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-30"><div><p>Contacted by The Times, a spokeswoman for Mr. Garcia said the two men met “briefly at a golf tournament” but had no further association.

Soon Mr. Perez and several of his deputies were charged in California with defrauding insurers of nearly $40 million in premiums.</p><p>In a personal bankruptcy filing in 2010, he claimed that he had only $17 in his checking account and owed $8 million in taxes. He also listed a $300 stake in a new agency: BaronHR.</p><p>In 2011, the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office dropped the criminal case against Mr. Perez after a victim, the State Compensation Insurance Fund, told prosecutors that it would disavow its own audits of the alleged fraud, records show. The supervising prosecutor on the case, now retired, told The Times that it was a highly unusual change of position, and could offer no explanation.</p><p>At the time, Mr. Perez announced in a news release that he had been “exonerated.” A number of his Checkmate clients followed him to BaronHR.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-31"><div><p>His phoenixlike return was emblematic of the “Wild West” nature of the staffing world, said Pollie Pent, a former detective with the California Department of Insurance’s fraud division who now works in the insurance industry. “There is very little oversight.”</p><p>In 2017, Mr. Perez was in trouble again and spent two mornings at the U.S. attorney’s office in Santa Ana, Calif., trying to cut a deal. Notes from the meetings reveal a rare unvarnished view of the business.</p><p>In Mr. Perez’s telling, the staffing industry was filled with people who used prison inmates’ social security numbers to help staff their work sites. He said the constant opening and closing of companies by the same owners signaled that they were evading taxes.</p><p>Agencies that skipped paying employment taxes could underbid the competition, said Mr. Perez, who offered to name firms that were “underpricing and skimming.” He also offered to identify partner companies that got their hands dirty by demanding kickbacks.</p><p>When it came to his own problems, he deflected many transgressions onto underlings and accountants, but admitted that he had bought cars, a boat and a plane while owing millions of dollars to the I.R.S. — and then hid assets so they would not be seized.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-32"><div><p>“Perez had a lot of possessions when he was operating Checkmate, and he wanted those things again,” an agent in the U.S. attorney’s office wrote in the notes.</p><p>In March 2018, Mr. Perez agreed to a secret plea deal that entailed admitting to tax evasion and cooperating on a broader industry investigation.</p><p>But separately, that August, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office charged him and two of his executives with tax and workers’ compensation insurance fraud.</p><p>Mr. Perez hardly missed a beat.</p><p>That December, he held a glittering gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel to celebrate a charity he had created and recognize BaronHR’s success.
