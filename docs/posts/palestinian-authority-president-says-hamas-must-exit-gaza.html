Mr. Macron has set a number of conditions for the possible French recognition of such a state at that meeting, including the disarmament of Hamas.</p><p>“Hamas will no longer rule Gaza and must hand over its weapons and military capabilities to the Palestinian security forces,” Mr. Abbas said in the letter, according to a statement from the Élysée Palace. He added that the Palestinian forces would oversee the removal of Hamas with Arab and international support, an undertaking that is certain to provoke skepticism in Israel, and probably also in Washington.</p><p>“Hamas must immediately release all hostages and captives,” the letter said, reiterating a demand that Mr. Abbas has made before.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A bitter feud has divided Mr. Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, and Hamas in Gaza for many years. The rival factions in the two Palestinian territories have defied several attempts at reconciliation, something that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has seized on to dismiss a two-state solution.</p><p>Mr. Abbas condemned the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people in some of the strongest terms that he has used, calling it “unacceptable and reprehensible.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Hamas handing over an Israeli hostage, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He equivocated in his first statement a few days after the attack, which also involved the abduction of about 250 hostages. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinian-president-says-he-rejects-killing-civilians-both-sides-conflict-2023-10-12/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He said then that he rejected “killing civilians or abusing them on both sides</a>.” But he has sharpened his tone recently.</p><p>Israel responded to the attack with a devastating war that has killed almost 56,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local authorities, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The toll and imposition of a blockade, now partially lifted, in the territory have provoked growing international outrage, including among European states like France and Britain little inclined to sharp criticism of Israel in the past.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Responding to another condition Mr. Macron has set for recognition of a Palestinian state, Mr. Abbas committed to reform the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/world/middleeast/palestinian-authority-gaza-war.html" title="">Palestinian Authority</a>, which is notoriously corrupt and ineffective. He also affirmed his intention to hold presidential and general elections within a year, under international auspices.</p><p>Mr. Abbas, 89, has made such commitments before without fulfilling them. He has cited various reasons, including difficulties with voting in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. No Palestinian presidential election has been held for three decades.</p><p>Israel is fiercely opposed to French recognition of a Palestinian state and has been dismissive of the conference next week in New York.. Like the United States, it has not indicated whether it will attend.</p><p>Tensions between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Macron have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/europe/france-macron-israel-netanyahu.html" title="">risen sharply in recent weeks</a>, with Israel accusing Mr. Macron of leading “<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/30/israel-accuses-macron-of-waging-a-crusade-against-the-jewish-state_6741839_4.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a crusade against the Jewish state</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>While other European states, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/middleeast/spain-norway-ireland-palestinian-statehood-israel.html" title="">Spain and Ireland,</a> have recognized a Palestinian state, the heft of France is particular because it is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, is the only nuclear power in the European Union and is home to the largest Jewish community in western Europe.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Emmanuel Macron of France, left, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in Jerusalem in 2023.

He is being lobbied by advisers on both sides, with supporters of recognition arguing it is the only way forward, and opponents saying it would reward terrorism.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Roger Cohen is the Paris Bureau chief for The Times, covering France and beyond.
