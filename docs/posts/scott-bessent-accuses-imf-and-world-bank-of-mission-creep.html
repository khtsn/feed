Now it devotes disproportionate time and resources to work on climate change, gender and social issues.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Arguing that its focus has overshadowed its economic mission, Mr. Bessent added: “These issues are not the I.M.F.’s mission.”</p><p>The Treasury secretary also had tough criticism for the World Bank, which under the Biden administration increased its focus on combating climate change.</p><p>“The bank should no longer expect blank checks for vapid, buzzword-centric marketing accompanied by halfhearted commitments to reform,” Mr. Bessent said. “As the bank returns to its core mission, it must use its resources as efficiently and effectively as possible. And it must do so in ways that demonstrate tangible value for all member countries.”</p><p>Mr. Bessent did applaud the bank’s plan, under the leadership of Ajay Banga, to consider ending its restrictions on lending for nuclear energy projects.</p><p>Mr. Banga has sought to emphasize the bank’s focus on job creation as key to economic development and to prioritize private sector involvement in projects around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Last week, Mr. Banga said that he continued to hold talks with the Trump administration about the direction of the bank.</p><p>“We’re having a constructive dialogue with the U.S. administration,” Mr. Banga said. “I don’t know where it’ll end, but I’ve got no problem with the dialogue I’m having.”</p><p>“They’re asking the right questions, and we’re trying to give them the right answers,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.
