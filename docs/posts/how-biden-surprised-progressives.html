But it’s an example of the kind of lofty praise for Biden that has been emanating from a corner of his party that would have seemed unimaginable for much of his career: the left.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“When it comes to domestic policy, President Biden probably would go down as one of the most effective presidents that centered the working class,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, told me this afternoon, although she added that she disagreed deeply with him on foreign policy issues such as the war in Gaza.</p><p>“I was surprised at the openness that was exhibited in his administration, particularly in the earliest days,” Ocasio-Cortez said.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
