Four arched bas-reliefs, sculpted into the walls, tell the story of the triumph of Flora, the ancient Roman goddess of flowers, gardens and fertility. An oval ceiling painting by Alexandre Cabanel celebrates Flora’s triumphal festival of spring. Light pours in through 10-foot-high stained-glass windows facing the Seine.</p><p>You sit at a leather-covered table lit by a lamp with a green glass shade. A staff member brings out one of the black file boxes that are kept in locked cases lining the room, opens it to reveal unframed drawings matted on heavy cardboard, removes the one you have chosen, and props it on a stand on the table.</p><p>One day I asked to see some works by Eugène Delacroix. I chose 10 drawings and sketches in watercolor and pen-and-ink, and was presented with several works, including Delacroix’s <a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl020015596" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“A Courtyard in Tangier,”</a> showing a staircase and a tent. Another work featured six muscular nude women; brown and yellow spots caused long ago by mold spores marked the paper.</p><p>During another visit, I viewed a leather volume of Albrecht Dürer’s engravings of the <a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl020579947" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passion and death of Christ</a>. The book was laid out on red felt, a white pillow supported its spine.</p><p>“You don’t have to be an art historian or professor to come here,” a Louvre official whispered to me. “You just need to be a serious art lover. We welcome all the world!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><em>Graphic Arts Department, Flore Wing, Porte des Lions entrance, 1st floor, Monday to Friday, 1:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. By reservation only.

The Hungarian point parquet floors creak; the fragile windows must be opened with care; the heat is rarely turned on during the winter.</p><p>The mansion is crammed with more than 8,000 Chinese and Japanese objects from the collection of Clémence d’Ennery, a ferocious collector of Asian art. Administered by the state-owned <a href="https://www.guimet.fr/en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Musée Guimet</a> since 1908, <a href="https://www.guimet.fr/fr/musee-d-ennery" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Musée d’Ennery</a> has been reopened on and off since 2011 for small groups for a few hours a week. To visit, you must register online.</p><p>Born in 1823 into a wealthy family, d’Ennery was a free spirit. While legally separated from her first husband, she became the consort of Adolphe Philippe d’Ennery, a playwright and novelist, and eventually married him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-14"><div><figcaption><span>Clémence d’Ennery &#34;collected whatever she wanted, whatever she liked,” said Véronique Crombé, an art historian and guide. “She didn’t pretend to be an expert.”</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Clémence d’Ennery never set foot in Asia. Instead, she acquired her objects through dozens of dealers in France. As her collection grew, she used her own money to build the mansion near the Bois de Boulogne. It became an important salon in Paris, where actors, writers, politicians and artists came by horse-drawn carriage to meet and view her collection.</p><p>“She collected whatever she wanted, whatever she liked,” said Véronique Crombé, an art historian and guide. “She didn’t pretend to be an expert.”</p><p>Childless, d’Ennery bequeathed her home and collection to the French state as a public museum, as long as everything remained intact.

She is actively fund-raising, and said she dreams of a restored museum with its own teahouse.</p><p><em>Musée d’Ennery, 59 avenue Foch, is open for guided tours on Saturdays.
