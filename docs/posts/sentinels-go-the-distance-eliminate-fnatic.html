</span> 2-1, eliminating them from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions 2024</a>.</p>

<p>The three-map series was played out on Sunset, Bind, and Lotus. Sunset was Sentinels&#39;s pick, Bind was Fnatic&#39;s, and Lotus was the decider. </p>

<p>Sentinels won Sunset 13-11, Fnatic won Bind 13-9, and Sentinels won Lotus 13-6.</p>

<p>Sunday&#39;s elimination match was the fourth-ever meeting between the two international powerhouses. Sentinels defeated Fnatic twice, 2-0 and 3-0, en route to capturing their first international trophy at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/353/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-reykjav-k" target="_blank">Masters Reykjavik</a>. They&#39;d meet again two seasons later in the first round of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN São Paulo</a>, where Fnatic would claim a 2-0 revenge victory. </p>

<p>On Sunset, EMEA&#39;s number-one seed got off to a flying start. They won the first three rounds of their attacking half, giving up just three kills to Sentinels in the process. </p>

<p>They played solid team Valorant, with every peek having an accompanied teammate and every post-plant having layered utility to give them the space needed for the spike to detonate.</p>

<p>Facing an 8-4 deficit at halftime, Sentinels regrouped and came back swinging. They won four of their first five attack rounds, seeming to have a read on Fnatic&#39;s defensive protocols.</p>

<p>In-game leader [johnqt] had a great read on what Fnatic wanted to do, and when it seemed as though the European team could claw their way back in, Sentinels put a stamp on the map, sealing a 13-11 finish that may have been too close for comfort.</p>

<p>Fnatic had 15 first kills on the map, but couldn&#39;t make the most of their man-advantage scenarios.</p>

<p>Sentinels began Bind on the attack and quickly identified the gaps in Fnatic&#39;s defense. Unfortunately for them, Fnatic was also adept in their attack half. </p>

<p>They&#39;d only give up two rounds en route to a clean 13-9 victory, with their eleventh-round clinching execution leaving Sentinels&#39; economy limped for the rest of the map.</p>


<p><em>Fnatic executes onto B site, forcing Sentinels&#39; last two players to save.</em></p>

<p>In Round 20, holding onto a 10-9 lead with Sentinels threatening to tie the game at 10 apiece, Fnatic executed a near-perfect take onto the B site. Across both Sunset and Bind, both teams made great use of ultimate abilities to seal rounds.</p>

<p>Fnatic closed the map 13-9, bringing both teams to Lotus. Sentinels&#39; most recent outing on the map was from their 2-1 loss to <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> the day before.</p>

<p>Sentinels played a relatively clean attacking half to open Lotus, a map widely regarded as attack-sided. Poking and prodding at the Fnatic defense gave Sentinels easy access to either of the three bomb sites, leading to an 8-4 lead. Two of the four round wins came as a result of them running out of time, unable to get the spike planted.</p>

<p>Fnatic&#39;s <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/438/boaster">
		Boaster	</a>
</span> described the defensive half of Lotus as frustrating. </p>

<p>“It could&#39;ve gone either way, but that&#39;s just Valorant. It&#39;s a frustrating game to be a part of and it can happen,” he said. Similar to Sunset, Fnatic had nine first kills, but could not convert on those man-advantages. “The scoreline says one thing, but our defense should have been reversed in terms of how many rounds they got and how many rounds we got.”</p>

<p>In the second half though, Sentinels showed their success in this series wouldn&#39;t be exclusive to the attacking half. They&#39;d win the pistol, anti-eco and bonus rounds to reach 11 rounds, just two away from advancing and eliminating Fnatic.</p>

<p>Facing an 11-4 deficit, Fnatic had a must-win round on their hands. They managed to plant the spike but with one man falling earlier in the round, a Sentinels retake was made too easy.</p>


<p><em>With a 5-4 man advantage, Sentinels make their B site retake look easy.</em></p>

<p>Fnatic mounted a comeback attempt the following round, clinching two rounds thanks to some <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/ObservantLachrymoseMoonOMGScoots-cpLcpBPLwKAfHlKO" target="_blank">time-savvy decision-making</a> from Boaster.</p>

<p>Fnatic closed out the following round, bubbling up some momentum, but it was never going to be enough against the economy-backed confidence of Sentinels, leaving them in the dust with a 13-6 scoreline.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/5022/derke">
		Derke	</a>
</span> finished 61-47, having the most kills in the server, while johnqt led his team in kills with a 55-37 scoreline.</p>

<p>“It is what it is. I&#39;m not gonna beat myself up about it. I&#39;ve already had a pretty dog event,” Boaster said with a chuckle following the match. He appeared to be in good spirits, even <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxZdJ3DQQJZBs9lhl8ja7ozKbGLazIXZ9j?si=LkTaNCRYqGUrjgfs" target="_blank">answering a question</a> from Sentinels&#39; <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/729/zellsis">
		Zellsis	</a>
</span>, who has been plying his trade as a reporter as of late.</p>

<p>With the victory, Sentinels punch their ticket to INSPIRE Arena and will move on to the lower bracket semifinals, awaiting the winner of <span data-ref-id="8">
