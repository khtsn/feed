They are the highest category of warnings possible in Japan and are usually only issued once every few decades, <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/know/faq/faq18.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Japan Meteorological Agency. With a risk of tornadoes in the prefecture on Wednesday evening, the agency <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/information/#area_type=offices&amp;info_id=20240828114750_0_VPHW51_460100&amp;format=text&amp;area_code=460100" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cautioned</a> people to pay attention to the sky and move inside sturdy buildings.</p><p>The storm was shifting north on Wednesday evening as it passed near Yakushima Island, an island southwest of Japan’s mainland. On Thursday, it was expected to maintain its force and approach Kyushu, one of Japan’s main islands, according to the meteorological agency. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It may make landfall in Kyushu on Friday, the agency <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/information/#area_type=japan&amp;info_id=20240828081509_0_VPTI50_010000&amp;format=text&amp;area_code=010000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, but forecasters are uncertain about its exact path. But Shanshan’s slow pace means it will lash some areas with relentless rain for hours, elevating threats of flooding. In southern Kyushu, there was a risk of record-breaking strong winds, high waves, high tides, and heavy rain, the agency warned. </p><p>The authorities warned that wind speeds could strengthen and topple some homes, and that the rain could cause flash flooding and landslides. The authorities issued evacuation orders for about 990,000 people across southern, western and central Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><p>Toyota announced that it would pause production at all 14 of its Japan factories overnight, starting Wednesday evening, to protect the safety of its workers. Shiro Tachimoto, a company representative, said the company would reassess on Thursday morning whether to keep the factories closed or reopen them.</p><p>In Aichi Prefecture in central Japan, one woman died after a landslide hit her family’s house, the public broadcaster NHK <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240827/k10014561591000.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Wednesday.

In some cities in central and eastern Japan, up to 10 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour window from Tuesday into Wednesday. Some cities in Japan saw winds of up to 86 miles per hour, equivalent to those of a Category 1 hurricane.</p><p>The typhoon slowed overnight as it approached the Amami Islands. At some point, after moving northwest along the coast during the day Thursday, the storm will likely turn back east. However, precisely when or where that will occur remains unclear. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Heavy rain is expected to continue after Friday, the Japan Meteorological Agency, said, when the region could see a record-breaking 39 inches of rain, mainly in southern Kyushu.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Japan last issued emergency warnings for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/world/asia/typhoon-nanmadol-japan.html" title="">Typhoon Nanmadol</a>, a 2022 storm that brought torrential rain and landslides to Kyushu.
