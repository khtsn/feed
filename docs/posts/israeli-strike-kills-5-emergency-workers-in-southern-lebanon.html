There was no immediate comment from the United States or France, which last month had put forward a proposal for a 21-day pause in the fighting.</p><p>The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had struck 110 sites in Lebanon over the past day and claimed that it had killed two Hezbollah commanders. Hezbollah did not comment on the claims.</p><p>Hezbollah also kept up its rocket attacks into Israel on Thursday, with the Israeli military saying that 40 projectiles had been launched from Lebanon in the morning, setting off sirens in parts of the country’s north. Some were intercepted but several struck the area, according to the military. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.</p><p>Hezbollah said it had been targeting Israeli troops stationed along the border with Lebanon, and in the city of Kiryat Shmona.
