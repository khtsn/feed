It must decide whether to force Mr. Hogg and a second vice chair, Malcolm Kenyatta, to run again in another election later this year.</p><p>Mr. Hogg, 25, an outspoken survivor of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., has prompted a fierce backlash <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/david-hogg-dnc-leaders-we-deserve.html" title="">over his plans</a> to spend up to $20 million through another organization he heads, Leaders We Deserve, on primary campaigns against incumbent Democrats. Ken Martin, the party chairman, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/david-hogg-ken-martin-dnc.html" title="">has said it is inappropriate</a> for Mr. Hogg to intervene in primaries while serving as a party official, and has recommended changing the party’s bylaws to force him to sign a neutrality pledge.</p><p>The ruling by the credentials committee on Monday was not technically related to Mr. Hogg’s plans to engage in primaries. Instead, it was the result of a complaint from Kalyn Free, one of the losing candidates in the vice chair race. Ms. Free said the party had wrongly combined two separate questions into a single vote, putting at a disadvantage the female candidates because of the party’s gender-parity rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement, Mr. Hogg acknowledged the decision was made on procedural grounds but said that “it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party, which loomed large over this vote.”</p><p>“The D.N.C. has pledged to remove me, and this vote has provided an avenue to fast-track that effort,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Kenyatta expressed <a href="https://x.com/malcolmkenyatta/status/1922110535090176247" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frustration on social media</a> — both with the committee’s decision and all the attention on Mr. Hogg, noting that he had won 298 votes to 214.5 for Mr. Hogg. He called the decision “a slap in my face,” and said the process was not about Mr. Hogg “even though he clearly wants it to be.”</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Martin said: “I am disappointed to learn that before I became chair, there was a procedural error in the February vice chair elections. The credentials committee has issued their recommendation, and I trust that the D.N.C. members will carefully review the committee’s resolution and resolve this matter fairly.”</p><p>Mr. Hogg’s intention to engage in primaries was not the subject of the discussion on Monday, which turned on arcane parliamentary procedures and the decision of party officials to combine votes for the last two vice chair slots into a single vote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Hogg and Mr. Kenyatta were elected at the same time. Mr. Kenyatta, 34, is a state lawmaker in Pennsylvania, and their elections as vice chairs have injected two younger voices into the party’s leadership.</p><p>“This is about fairness and making sure that three women and the voting members of the D.N.C. are not disenfranchised,” Ms. Free said in a statement before the meeting, during which she enlisted a parliamentary expert to plead her case.</p><p>Leading up to the vote, the credentials committee had appeared torn on what to do. An initial resolution from Christine Pelosi, the daughter of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, seeking to dismiss the complaint resulted in a tie vote. A second resolution calling for a new election with the same candidates who participated in February was eventually approved.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shane Goldmacher is a Times national political correspondent.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Legal Tool Key to Civil Rights Enforcement:</strong> President Trump has ordered federal agencies to halt their use of “disparate-impact liability,” which has been used to assess <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/trump-civil-rights.html">whether policies discriminate against different groups</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Librarian of Congress Is Fired:</strong> The White House said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/trump-librarian-congress-carla-hayden.html">Carla Hayden</a>, the first African American and first woman to serve as the head of the institution, was fired because she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/hayden-library-of-congress-dei.html">promoted diversity, equity and inclusion</a>.
