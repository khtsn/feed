Representatives for Pitt did not immediately respond to an inquiry overnight.</p><p>The couple <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-married-in-france/" title="">married</a> in a small chapel in France in 2014, after meeting on the set of the 2005 movie “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/movies/for-better-or-worse-even-on-a-battlefield.html" title="">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</a>.” A little over two years later, a lawyer for Jolie <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/fashion/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce.html" title="">said that she was divorcing Pitt</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Jolie later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/movies/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-lawsuit.html" title="">described in court papers</a> a September 2016 episode that occurred a few days before she filed for divorce. Jolie said that as she, Pitt and their six children flew from France to California in a private jet, he became abusive toward her and some of the children.</p><p>A divorce lawyer for Pitt said at the time that he had accepted responsibility for some things in his past but would not accept responsibility for things he did not do.</p><p>Federal authorities in the United States investigated the episode on the plane but declined to bring criminal charges. Jolie’s lawyers said the F.B.I. agent who investigated the allegations of physical assault had “concluded that the government had probable cause to charge Pitt with a federal crime for his conduct that day.” A redacted F.B.I. report on the case said the agent provided “copies of a probable cause statement related to this incident” to the United States Attorney’s Office.</p><p>The decoupling has taken years in part because Pitt and Jolie have been fighting for custody of their children. Separate from the divorce proceedings, Pitt also instigated a lawsuit over Château Miraval, a French winery the couple once owned together.</p><p>His lawsuit, filed in 2022, accused Jolie of violating his contractual rights when she sold her half of the company to a third party without his approval.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Her lawyers said in court documents that the couple had agreed in principle in 2021 that she would sell her share of the business to Pitt. But negotiations broke down over his demand that she sign a nondisclosure agreement, they said.</p><p>That agreement would have prohibited Jolie from speaking outside of court about his “physical and emotional abuse of her and their children,” her lawyers said.</p><p>News of the couple’s divorce settlement was <a href="https://people.com/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-finalize-divorce-settlement-exclusive-8575385" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by People magazine</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mike Ives is a reporter for The Times based in Seoul, covering breaking news around the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-ives">More about Mike Ives</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
