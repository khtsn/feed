Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of China’s Central Military Commission, was the first in years between a senior American official and a vice chair of the commission, which oversees China’s armed forces and is chaired by Mr. Xi. In 2018, Jim Mattis, who was the U.S. defense secretary at the time, met with Gen. Xu Qiliang, who held the vice chair position.</p><p>It was the latest effort by the two powers to keep communication channels open even as disputes grow over national security, trade and geopolitics. On the military front, the United States has argued that more open communication is necessary to prevent accidents between the two countries’ warplanes and navy ships as they regularly patrol contested areas like the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.</p><p>“A meeting with Zhang Youxia is very significant, and an indication that China is prepared to meaningfully re-engage with the Department of Defense,” said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. “Beijing views the military-to-military relationship as an important political indicator of the overall relationship, which differs somewhat from the U.S. perspective, which sees it as a more pragmatic channel to reduce risk.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Sullivan’s meeting with General Zhang, which was held at the headquarters of China’s People’s Liberation Army, came on the final day of his three-day visit to Beijing to bolster the Biden administration’s bid to manage competition with China.</p><p>China and the United States have been locked in a rivalry for global influence and have seen tensions rise over a raft of issues, including China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, its tacit support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, and the flood of Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels onto global markets.</p><p>“We believe that competition with China does not have to lead to conflict and confrontation — the key is responsible management through diplomacy,” Mr. Sullivan said at a news conference after meeting with Mr. Xi.</p><p>Even as the visit was a chance for both nations to reassure the world that they were working to lower the risk of conflict between them, it was clear that they were still fundamentally divided on strategic issues. China has rejected Washington’s framing of the bilateral relationship as being defined by competition, a stance Mr. Xi highlighted at the top of an official summary of the meeting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“First of all, we must answer the general question of whether China and the United States are rivals or partners,” Mr. Xi told Mr. Sullivan. China’s intentions were “above board,” he said, and his country was committed to “peaceful development.” He said he hoped that the United States would work with China to “find a correct way for the two major countries to get along.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Sullivan also met with Gen.

He also reiterated China’s opposition to American support for Taiwan, the island democracy that Beijing claims.</p><p>“China demands that the United States stop military collusion between the United States and Taiwan, stop arming Taiwan, and stop spreading false narratives involving Taiwan,” the general said, according to the official statement.</p><p>Mr. Sullivan later said that having a chance to speak in person with General Zhang had made a difference.</p><p>“The meeting with Vice Chairman Zhang was very important — there is no substitute for actually being able to sit across the table not just with the vice chairman but with his whole team, to be able to hear from them their perspective on critical issues,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Sullivan and China’s most senior diplomatic official, Wang Yi, said their countries’ top military commanders in the region would hold a video call at some point.</p><p>Mr. Thompson said such a call could help reinvigorate lower-level dialogue that used to take place more frequently in the past. Those meetings, he said, allowed military personnel to discuss aerial and maritime maneuvers in greater detail to prevent accidents.</p><p>Washington is also concerned about encounters between China and U.S. allies that could draw American forces into a confrontation. That includes the most recent standoff between the Philippines and China near a disputed atoll, Sabina Shoal, where Chinese coast guard vessels have rammed Philippine ships and targeted them with water cannons.</p><p>“The order of the day should be de-escalation” in the South China Sea, said Mr. Sullivan, who, during his talks in Beijing, raised America’s commitment to defend the Philippines as a treaty ally.</p><p>“Nobody is looking for a crisis — not the Philippines, not the United States and, we hope, not the P.R.C.,” he said, referring to the People’s Republic of China.</p><p>Such regional tensions have led to chilly relations between the Pentagon and the Chinese military over the past several years. China suspended military-to-military communications in 2022 after Nancy Pelosi, who was speaker of the House at the time, visited Taiwan. They were restored in December when President Biden’s senior military adviser, Gen. Charles Q. Brown, held a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/us/politics/us-china-military-dialogue.html" title="">videoconference call</a> with his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Liu Zhenli.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Keith Bradsher is the Beijing bureau chief for The Times.
