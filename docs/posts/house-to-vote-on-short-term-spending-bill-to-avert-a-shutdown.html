He plans to bring the legislation to a vote on Wednesday evening using a special procedure that requires the support of two-thirds of those voting to pass.</p><p>It is the continuation of a long-running saga that has bedeviled House Republican leaders, both Mr. Johnson and Speaker Kevin McCarthy before him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since gaining control of the House nearly two years ago, Republican leaders have been forced time and time again to rely on Democrats to provide most of the votes on bills to avert shutdowns. A significant number of conservatives in the House G.O.P. conference are fundamentally opposed to legislation that does not mandate deep cuts to federal spending and routinely try to block such measures from even being considered.</p><p>Mr. Johnson on Tuesday called the legislation, known as a continuing resolution, “a very narrow, bare-bones C.R. to do only what’s absolutely necessary.”</p><p>“It would be political malpractice to shut the government down,” he said. “I think everyone understands that, and so we hope that this will get done quickly, and we get everybody back home to their districts to work into the campaign trail.”</p><p>The bill also includes $230 million in additional funding for the Secret Service, which has been asking for more money in the wake of two failed assassination attempts on former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate.</p><p>Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said on Tuesday that “once the House acts, the Senate will move quickly to get the C.R. done.” Lawmakers have until midnight on Monday to get the legislation to President Biden’s desk in order to avert a shutdown.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Biden administration’s Office of Management and Budget said on Tuesday that Mr. Biden would sign the bill into law.</p><p>Mr. Johnson had previously pushed for a longer-term spending deal that also included legislation requiring that those registering to vote show proof of citizenship. Democrats rejected those demands, and some conservatives in the House joined with them last week to sink their own speaker’s proposal.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Congress</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Capitol Hill.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Spending Deal: </strong>Congressional leaders unveiled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/us/congress-spending-deal-johnson.html">short-term agreement to fund the government through Dec. 20</a>, after Speaker Mike Johnson dropped his demands for proof-of-citizenship voting requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>I.V.F.
