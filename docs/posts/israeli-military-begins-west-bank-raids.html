The Palestinian Authority, which has typically left security in the area to Israel has been conducting an unusually public crackdown on militants in the Israeli-occupied territory.</p><p>On Monday night, Jewish extremists raided several Palestinian villages in the West Bank, just hours after President Trump rescinded sanctions imposed by the Biden administration on dozens of Israeli individuals and far-right settler groups accused of violence against Palestinians.</p><p>The cancellation of the sanctions was one of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a long list of executive orders that Mr. Trump signed</a> immediately after his inauguration. Palestinian officials strongly criticized the move, saying it was likely to encourage further violence. Hard-line members of Israel’s right-wing government and leaders of the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank had been requesting the removal of the sanctions, which then-President Biden imposed under an executive order he signed almost a year ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some settler leaders have nurtured close ties with Mr. Trump’s associates over the years, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/mike-huckabee-ambassador-to-israel.html" title="">Mike Huckabee</a>, Mr. Trump’s pick as the next ambassador to Jerusalem.</p><p>The cancellation of the sanctions coincided with a second consecutive night of violence in the West Bank as extremist settlers protested against the cease-fire in Gaza, which took effect on Sunday and ushered in a period of calm after 15 months of war prompted by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led assault on Israel. Attackers set fire to vehicles and property, according to Palestinian officials and the Israeli military.</p><p>Far-right members of the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and their supporters oppose the cease-fire, the first phase of which calls for a six-week truce and weekly exchanges of a total of 33 hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>The details of the deal’s second phase have yet to be negotiated, but it calls for the temporary cease-fire to become permanent and for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.</p><p>Violence in the West Bank sharply escalated after the Oct. 7 attack. The growing power of militants in West Bank cities like Jenin and Tulkarm has prompted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/world/middleeast/west-bank-raids-gaza-war.html" title="">a deadly cycle of Israeli raids and drone strikes</a>, which have devastated Palestinian neighborhoods.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Israeli troops have seized neighborhoods for days at a time, searching for suspected militants as bulldozers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/west-bank-raids.html" title="">chew through roads</a> looking for explosives. The Israeli military says its soldiers were compelled to conduct the deadly raids to quell the militants.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
