At that price, each egg would cost about 65 cents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Waffle House, which was founded in 1955 and now has more than <a href="https://www.wafflehouse.com/our-story/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,900 locations in 25 states</a>, serves more than 272 million eggs a year, according to the company’s <a href="https://www.wafflehouse.com/beyond-the-menu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>. The chain, which is based in Georgia, said that rather than increase prices across its menu, the surcharge was “temporarily targeted.”</p><p>“While we hope these price fluctuations will be short-lived, we cannot predict how long this shortage will last,” Waffle House said. “We are continuously monitoring egg prices and will adjust or remove the surcharge as market conditions allow.”</p><p>For many consumers, the price of eggs has become a tangible barometer of the economy and the rising cost of food in the United States. Shoppers who have come to rely on eggs as a traditionally inexpensive protein source have lamented about the high prices — about <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_consumer_price_index_eggs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">37 percent higher</a> last month than a year earlier — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/business/egg-shortage-prices.html" title="">empty grocery store shelves</a> where eggs used to be plentiful.</p><p>The cost of eggs has also been a political talking point. Donald J. Trump complained about <a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-bedminster-new-jersey-august-15-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the high price of eggs</a> when he was running for president last year. Earlier this month, Brooke Rollins, Mr. Trump’s nominee for secretary of agriculture, said that one of her top priorities was to “immediately and comprehensively get a handle on animal disease outbreaks.”</p><p>Egg prices are rising because of inflation as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/health/birdflu-marine-mammals.html" title="">the bird flu</a>, which made its way to the United States in 2022 after it was detected in Canada. To date, the disease has infected or killed almost <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">150 million birds</a>. But the situation has gotten worse in the last few months. More than 30 million chickens have recently been killed to prevent the spread of disease and experts say it could take months before the supply of egg-laying chickens stabilizes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the meantime, Waffle House has added stickers to its menus informing customers about the surcharge, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/food/waffle-house-egg-surcharge/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to CNN</a>, while emphasizing that eggs will remain a staple of its food.</p><p>“As long as they are available, quality, fresh-cracked, Grade-A large eggs will remain a key ingredient in many of our customers’ favorite meals,” Waffle House said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Kate Christobek is a reporter covering breaking news for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-christobek">More about Kate Christobek</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/waffle-house">Waffle House</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
