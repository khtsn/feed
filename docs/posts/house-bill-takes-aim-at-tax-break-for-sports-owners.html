Intangible assets make up the bulk of a team’s worth, and because team values have been steadily rising, the tax breaks have as well. The tax break has turned teams into a kind of tax shelter and has helped fuel the lofty prices that investment firms and billionaires have paid for teams in recent years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While the provision in the House bill would not affect current owners, only future ones, it threatens to have a chilling effect across sports ownership.</p><p>If demand for teams cools, current owners could be hurt because the value of their investments might not grow as quickly. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that cutting the write-offs in half would raise $991 million in revenue over 10 years.</p><p>Team owners insist the number is far higher, though almost all teams are privately held and do not disclose their financials. Leagues have been doing the math to determine how much the tax bill might hurt them.</p><p>The prospect of the tax changes could spur sellers — or buyers — to move more quickly ahead of any changes being formalized, said Mark Weinstein, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells.</p><p>N.F.L. owners, who met for two days in Eagan, Minn., last week, were briefed on the provision. According to team executives, the owners were encouraged to call senators in their home states to pressure them not to include a similar provision in the Senate version of the policy bill. One team president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared potential fallout from the president,<span>  </span>said that the provision “felt punitive.” President Trump, he and others said, wants leverage over the owners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The White House disputed that suggestion. A White House spokesman, Harrison Fields, said the tax measure was about eliminating an advantage for owners at a time when the price of attending sporting events is rising.</p><p>“The president is committed to ensuring that sports teams overcharging ticketholders do not receive favorable tax treatment,” Mr. Fields said in a statement. “His focus is on fairness for fans, not team ownership.”</p><p>It’s unclear whether the provision was aimed at the N.F.L., which Mr. Trump has sparred with over many years, since it affects all major leagues. That could be by design, Mr. Weinstein said.</p><p>“If it was just the N.F.L., then it leads to the conclusion it is punitive, right? If it’s all sports leagues, maybe there’s some wiggle room,” Mr. Weinstein said. “It’s classic Trump, if you think about it, in that he might intend it to be punitive, but he presents it in a way — maybe it is, maybe it is not.”</p><p>In recent years, Mr. Trump has battled over a number of issues with teams and athletes, including the N.B.A. stars LeBron James and Stephen Curry. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/business/trump-super-bowl-nfl.html" title="">his relationship with the N.F.L.</a> dates back to the 1980s when he began showing an interest in buying a team. Unable to land a franchise, he bought the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League in 1984 and led an effort to sue the N.F.L. for trying to prevent the U.S.F.L., a spring league, from playing in the fall. The U.S.F.L. won, but was awarded three dollars in damages. The league soon folded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Over the years, Mr. Trump has chided the N.F.L. He played down the <a href="https://time.com/4530832/donald-trump-concussion-cte-nfl-football/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">severity of concussions</a> and in 2017, he urged owners to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/sports/trump-national-anthem-nfl.html" title="">fire players</a> who did not stand for the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality.</p><p>But Mr. Trump remains friendly with several owners, including Woody Johnson of the Jets and Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys. In March, the Patriots owner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/paul-weiss-trump.html" title="">Robert Kraft reached out to the president</a> to broker a deal with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, a law firm that represents the N.F.L.</p><p>This year, the New Orleans Saints owner Gayle Benson invited Mr. Trump to the Super Bowl, and the title-winning Philadelphia Eagles visited the White House. Two weeks ago, Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris went to the Oval Office <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/trump-celebrates-nfl-commissioner-roger-182658042.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to announce</a> that the N.F.L. draft would take place in Washington in 2027.</p><p>Ultimately, Mr. Weinstein said that the allure of teams is so strong that wealthy investors would continue to buy teams, regardless of tax incentives.</p><p>“If you’re a buyer and you’ve got that much wealth that you want to join the club, you’re going to pay the price,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ken Belson is a Times reporter covering sports, power and money at the N.F.L. and other professional sports leagues.</p></div><div><p>Lauren Hirsch is a Times reporter who covers deals and dealmakers in Wall Street and Washington.</p></div><div><p>Andrew Duehren covers tax policy for The Times from Washington.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Jenner &amp; Block: </strong>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-jenner-block-law-firm.html">struck down an executive order</a> that threatened penalties against the law firm, which once employed a top attorney who helped investigate the president alongside the team run by Robert Mueller, who was then the special counsel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restricting Covid Shots: </strong>The Food and Drug Administration announced that it was likely to limit access to Covid vaccines among healthy children and adults this fall. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/health/covid-vaccine-restrictions-eligibility.html">Here’s what experts expect if the plan goes forward</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greenhouse Gas Limits on Power Plants: </strong>The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/climate/epa-power-plant-rules.html">eliminate all limits</a> on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The Times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Crypto Dinner:</strong> The Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to identify who was invited to President Trump’s private event for customers of his cryptocurrency business and a White House tour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-crypto-dinner-attendees.html">Here are some of them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build-Out of Nuclear Power Plants:</strong> President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/climate/trump-executive-order-nuclear-power.html">accelerating the construction of the plants</a>, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors that offer the promise of faster deployment but have yet to be proven.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ignoring Economic Warning Signs: </strong>The president’s economic policy approach is so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-taxes-tariffs-economy.html">rattling markets, businesses and consumers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>MAHA Report: </strong>The G.O.P. chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were “troubled” by the Make America Healthy Again Commission’s findings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republican-agriculture-pesticides-kennedy-maha-report.html">urged it to use sounder science</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Rare Check on Trump’s Actions: </strong>President Trump has suffered a string of court losses, as federal judges ruled that his administration broke the law on a number of matters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-courts-judges-law.html">But judicial orders to unwind his actions can be easier said than done</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
