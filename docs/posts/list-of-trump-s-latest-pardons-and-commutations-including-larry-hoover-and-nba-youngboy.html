It also included those who have expressed political support or echoed the president in claiming they had been unfairly targeted because of their political affiliation.</p><p>Mr. Trump also issued pardons for Michael G. Grimm, a former New York representative who pleaded guilty in 2014 to felony tax evasion. Mr. Trump’s aides have compared Mr. Grimm’s prosecution to Mr. Trump’s own legal troubles, which he has described as witch hunt.</p><p>The White House did not immediately make public the list of the recent pardons and commutations on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Monday, Ed Martin, a Trump adviser helping lead efforts that include the pardon process, wrote on social media, “No MAGA left behind.”</p><p>The new slate of clemency actions was the latest sign of Mr. Trump’s efforts to redefine the sweeping presidential act of forgiveness. Rather than following the formal and often lengthy Justice Department process to vet clemency applicants, Mr. Trump has preferred to hand out pardons to reward his supporters, incentivize loyalty to his administration or bolster supporters.</p><p>He has also relied on Alice Johnson, who was sentenced to life in prison in a drug conspiracy case and whose sentence was later commuted by Mr. Trump. He then named her “pardon czar.”</p><p>Here is a list of recipients of Mr. Trump’s latest acts of clemency.</p><h2 id="link-540450bf">Pardons</h2><p><strong>Mark Bashaw</strong></p><p>Mark C. Bashaw, a former Army lieutenant, was convicted in 2022 by a military judge for disobeying lawful Covid-19 protocols, including refusing to work remotely, failing to submit required testing and not wearing a face mask indoors.</p><p><strong>James Callahan</strong></p><p>Mr. Callahan was a New York labor union leader who pleaded guilty to failing to report more than $300,000 in gifts. He admitted that the reports he filed for the engineers union he led omitted his receipt of goods and services from an advertising firm that the union used to place ads, including free tickets to nearly 100 sports, concert and theater events and hospitality packages valued at $315,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Julie Chrisley and Todd Chrisley</strong></p><p>The Chrisleys, who are reality television stars, were convicted three years ago of evading taxes and defrauding banks of more than $30 million to support their luxurious lifestyle. Mr. Trump called their treatment “pretty harsh.” The Chrisleys’ daughter Savannah is a supporter of Mr. Trump’s. During the Republican National Convention last summer, she said her parents were “persecuted by rogue prosecutors” because of their public profile and conservative beliefs.</p><p><strong>Kentrell Gaulden</strong></p><p>Mr. Gaulden, a Louisiana rapper, is better known as YoungBoy Never Broke Again or NBA YoungBoy. He pleaded guilty in December to possessing weapons as a felon. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump occasionally appeared with hip-hop artists as a part of an effort to connect with Black male voters.</p><p>“I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building — as a man, as a father and as an artist,” Mr. Gaulden, a father of 10, said in a statement on Wednesday. Mr. Gaulden also credited Ms. Johnson, the president’s so-called pardon czar.</p><p><strong>Michael Grimm</strong></p><p>Mr. Grimm, a Republican, represented Staten Island and part of Brooklyn in the House of Representatives from 2011 until he resigned in 2015. He was indicted in 2014 after he failed to report nearly $1 million in gross receipts and hundreds of thousands of dollars in employee wages from a Manhattan restaurant he had owned, prosecutors said. In recent years, he has gone on television to defend Mr. Trump. But he has been off the air since a horseback riding accident at a polo tournament last September that left him paralyzed.</p><p><strong>Michael Harris</strong></p><p>Mr. Harris is a music executive who co-founded Death Row Records. He served 33 years of a 25-year-to-life sentence after being convicted of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Mr. Harris, known as Harry-O, began working as a social activist while in prison. He endorsed Mr. Trump in October.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Jeremy Hutchinson</strong></p><p>A former Arkansas state senator, Mr. Hutchinson was sentenced to more than four years in prison in 2023 for tax fraud and accepting bribes.</p><p>Mr. Hutchinson, a Republican, is the son of Tim Hutchinson, a former U.S. senator, and the nephew of Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas. In a letter to the president advocating a pardon, Mr. Hutchinson’s lawyers wrote that “it is absolutely clear that Democrats at the Department of Justice and within the F.B.I. chose to prosecute the case because he was a high-profile conservative legislator from a Republican family.”</p><p>David Leavitt, a lawyer who represented Mr. Hutchinson in his appeal, said in an interview that “the reason why this pardon occurred is because it’s a statement to prosecutors everywhere: ‘Stop forcing people to plead guilty.’”</p><p><strong>Marlene Kernan and James Kernan</strong></p><p>Marlene and James Kernan of New York were sentenced to probation in 2010 in connection with employing a felon at their businesses.</p><p><strong>Tanner Mansell</strong></p><p><strong>John Moore</strong></p><p>Taylor Mansell and John Moore, Florida commercial divers, were convicted of theft in 2022 for removing sharks from a government-sanctioned fishing line in federal waters, according to a White House official and their attorneys. They argued they were rescuing the sharks from an illegal poaching operation, but prosecutors said the line was legally set and not theirs to disturb.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Gov. John Rowland</strong></p><p>Mr. Rowland served as the governor of Connecticut from 1995 to 2004, when he resigned to avoid impeachment during an investigation into corrupt government practices. He pleaded guilty later that year and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Ten years later, Mr. Rowland was convicted again of public corruption, including obstructing justice, conspiracy, falsifying documents relied on by federal regulators and other violations of campaign finance laws.</p><p><strong>Earl Smith</strong></p><p>Earl Lamont Smith was an Army reserve sergeant in 2010 when he was caught stealing thousands of government computers and selling them for profit. Mr. Smith pleaded guilty at the time and waived his right to a trial. </p><p><strong>Alexander Sittenfeld</strong></p><p>Mr. Sittenfeld, a former Cincinnati City Council member, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdoh/pr/former-cincinnati-city-council-member-sentenced-16-months-prison-bribery-attempted" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was sentenced to 16 months in prison</a> for bribery and attempted extortion by a government official.</p><p><strong>Charles Tanner</strong></p><p>Charles Tanner was a professional boxer from Gary, Ind., until his arrest in 2004 and later conviction for possessing and conspiring to distribute cocaine. His life sentence was earlier commuted by Mr. Trump in 2020.</p><p><strong>Charles Scott</strong></p><p>Charles Scott, of Virginia, helped the chief executive of an Ohio-based lighting company manipulate the corporation’s stock value, make coordinated trades and defraud investors. He was sentenced this year to more than three years in prison for securities fraud.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Kevin Eric Baisden</strong></p><h2 id="link-2e179134">Commutations</h2><p><strong>Larry Hoover</strong></p><p>Mr. Hoover, known as “King Larry,” has been imprisoned in Illinois since the 1970s for the murder of a rival drug dealer when federal prosecutors dragged him back to court in 1997. His full commutation is not expected to put him back on the streets of Chicago. He has over 100 years left to serve on state murder charges in Illinois that presidential clemency does not erase. But it may lead to his transfer out of the supermax prison in Colorado where he is held.</p><p><strong>Imaad Zuberi</strong></p><p>Mr. Zuberi, a venture capitalist and major political donor, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for violating lobbying, campaign finance and tax laws, and obstructing an investigation into Mr. Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee.</p><p>In the three months after the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Zuberi donated more than $1.1 million to committees associated with Mr. Trump and the Republican Party, scoring coveted invitations to black-tie dinners celebrating Mr. Trump’s inauguration. In 2020, Mr. Zuberi pleaded guilty to obstructing a federal investigation into the source of a $900,000 donation he made through his company to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee in late December 2016.</p><p><strong>Marian Morgan</strong></p><p><strong>Garnett Smith</strong></p><p><strong>Edward Sotelo</strong></p><p><strong>Joe Sotelo</strong></p><p><strong>Anabel Valenzuela</strong></p><p><strong>Lawrence Duran</strong></p><p>Aishvarya Kavi<!-- -->, <!-- -->Mark Walker<!-- -->, <!-- -->Lauren McCarthy<!-- --> and <!-- -->Kenneth P.
