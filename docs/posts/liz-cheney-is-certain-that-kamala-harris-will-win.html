She pointedly called on former President George W. Bush to endorse Kamala Harris for president, as she and her father Dick Cheney, Bush’s vice president, had done. She said she had canceled her subscription to The Washington Post because the newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos decided not to endorse Harris for president under the fig leaf of foregoing endorsements.</p><p>She said Senator Mitch McConnell’s refusal to vote to convict Donald Trump in 2021 on the articles of impeachment was <em>the</em> reason Trump is the nominee today, arguing other Republicans would have fallen in line to convict if McConnell had the “courage” to do so.</p><p>But most interesting of all to me was the reason for her confident prediction that opened the festival conversation: “Kamala Harris is going to be the next president of the United States.”</p><p>I wasn’t surprised by the prediction — Cheney is campaigning energetically for Harris to defeat Trump — but I was struck that the former vice chair of the Jan. 6 House select committee did not primarily argue that threats to democracy would lift Harris to victory.</p><p>Rather, she said that in her conversations with independent and undecided voters, what is really moving them into Harris’s corner was “what a second Trump term would mean for the women of this country.” She specifically cited the draconian Republican bans and limits on reproductive health care and other medical needs that have led to traumatic and disabling injuries for pregnant women in Texas and other states with bans in place.</p><p>To be sure, Cheney argued that many voters would reject Trump because he broke his oath to the Constitution and tried to overturn the 2020 election results and because he has degraded the rule of law. That’s what turned her against Trump after years of supporting him, which she called her “biggest professional regret.”</p><p>But she said she thought women would rally against Trump in enormous numbers, seeing him as a fundamentally cruel and depraved person who did not care about their health, rights or well-being.</p><p>With that, Cheney put her finger on one of the big known unknowns of this election: would women and others who support abortion rights turn out for Democrats in such a wave, as they did in 2022 and 2023, that Trump won’t know what hit him?</p><p>For the most part, the Manhattan audience was deeply appreciative of Cheney’s reassuring words about Harris and her leadership against Trump — the steady applause for her is another reminder of the bizarro Trump political universe we are in where a strong conservative like Cheney is warmly welcomed by a predominantly liberal audience.</p><p>But it’s also a reminder of how Trump unites everyone from Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift, as Liz Cheney noted.</p><p>Asked by Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, if she thought Trump was a fascist, Cheney said, “I think you’d be hard pressed to say he’s not.” And she was withering about the Post and its owner.</p><p>“When you have Jeff Bezos apparently afraid to issue an endorsement for the only candidate in the race who’s a stable responsible adult because he fears Donald Trump, that tells you why we have to work so hard to make sure that Donald Trump isn’t elected,” Cheney said.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="31" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzUxOGE2NmM4LWZlYmQtNWM5Ny1iNDVlLWQ4ZmVhODAwYTkzZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#gaza-polio-vaccine-un" data-source-id="100000009778839"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neel-v--patel"><img alt="Neel V.

After the first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years was identified in a 10-month-old baby in August, the United Nations and its partners swiftly administered the first dose of the vaccine to over half a million children by Sept. 12. Israel and Hamas agreed to several pauses in fighting to allow safe access to vaccine sites.</p><p>That very rare public health win may be all for naught. The administration of second doses in northern Gaza is now on hold because of increased violence and unsafe conditions threatening the vaccination sites, the U.N. agencies leading the campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/23/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah/aid-agencies-postpone-polio-vaccinations-in-northern-gaza?ogrp=dpl&amp;smid=url-share" title="">said on Wednesday</a>. Second doses must be given within six weeks of a first dose in order to provide maximum protection against polio, which means the window for the next phase is closing very soon.</p><p>Delays in the campaign could leave children vulnerable to this highly contagious virus, which can cause paralysis, respiratory failure and death. If polio spreads unchecked, a larger outbreak of the disease will probably threaten not just those trapped in Gaza but also the region as a whole.</p><p>It’s perhaps the worst-case scenario one could envision. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/opinion/gaza-polio-infectious-disease.html" title="">a guest essay for Opinion earlier this month</a>, Mohammed Aghaalkurdi, a doctor who helped administer the first doses of the vaccine in Gaza, described the frustrations he and others felt seeing people celebrate the polio vaccine campaign while Gazans were trying to avoid the threat of bombs and artillery fire, scavenge for food to stave off starvation and keep the spread of other infectious diseases at bay.</p><p>The erosion of medical care and humanitarian standards meant even minor health conditions could balloon into life-threatening problems. Aghaalkurdi pointed out that malnutrition already threatened to blunt the effectiveness of the polio vaccine. That may now be a moot point for any children who cannot even get access to a second dose.</p><p>There is no military solution to a public health crisis — polio will not be stopped by bombs, bullets or borders. If children in northern Gaza can’t safely get access to vaccination sites, they may become part a larger catastrophe that envelops the region.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2YyNjc2ODNhLTIwMDgtNThlZC05OGUwLTE0ZDkxYWQwODEzNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#trump-harris-electoral-college" data-source-id="100000009783255"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-25T16:23:30.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 25, 2024, 12:23 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>How do you get rid of the Electoral College? The easiest path is for both parties to suffer an Electoral College inversion — to win more popular votes nationwide but lose the election — in proximity to each other. That way everyone experiences the unfairness of the system, providing the necessary momentum for constitutional change.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Democrats have been on the short end of all Electoral College inversions in the country’s history and twice in this century alone, which is why many people think the debate over how we choose our president is unavoidably partisan. It isn’t.</p><p>As Nate Cohn, the chief political analyst of The Times, explained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/upshot/poll-trump-harris-election.html" title="">in his Friday newsletter</a>, current polling and demographic trends suggest that Donald Trump could plausibly win more popular votes than Kamala Harris next month and yet lose in the Electoral College.</p><p>This scenario is not particularly likely for a number of reasons Cohn lays out, but neither is it remote. As he noted, even though the Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections, under slightly different circumstances the outcome in a few of those elections could have been reversed.</p><p>If there is an overriding theme of the 2024 election so far, it’s that nothing is likely and anything is possible. So let’s take this opportunity to engage in a fun mental exercise: What if Trump prevails in the popular vote and still loses the Electoral College? One thing we can say with certainty is that Republicans, despite their consistent defenses of the college, will be hopping mad.</p><p>How can we be so sure? Because they’ve already told us. Most people forget that in the weeks leading up to the 2000 election, there were warnings that the Electoral College and the popular vote would diverge — in Al Gore’s favor. George W. Bush’s team was not going to take that lying down. Inside the Bush campaign, there was talk of a P.R. blitz to remind Americans of the Electoral College’s “essential unfairness.” In <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2000/11/01/bush-set-to-fight-an-electoral-college-loss/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an article in The New York Daily News</a> days before the election, an unnamed Bush aide was quoted as predicting a popular uprising “because the will of the people will have been thwarted.” It didn’t work out that way, of course. But even the possibility was enough to get the right’s engines running.</p><p>Then there was Election Day 2012, when early returns suggested Mitt Romney might prevail in the popular vote but lose the Electoral College to President Barack Obama. Donald Trump, a private citizen at the time who supported Romney, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-updates-on-the-2016-election-voting-and-race-results/trump-in-2012-the-electoral-college-is-a-disaster-for-a-democracy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>, “The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.”</p><p>To this I can only say, amen. As the rest of us have been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Let-People-Pick-President-Abolishing/dp/1250221978" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arguing for decades</a>, it is wrong for a representative democracy to reject majority rule in the biggest election of all. Alas, as Republicans never tire of pointing out, these are the rules of the game. If Kamala Harris wins the Electoral College with fewer popular votes, she will be the president no less than Donald Trump was in 2016 or George W. Bush was in 2000.</p><p>Then, perhaps, we could have a real conversation about ending this absurd, antidemocratic system once and for all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="27" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2ViYzQ1ZDMyLTgwZDYtNTE0OS04YTM3LTAzMjE2MmRmMmFmNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#bad-behavior-carlson-trump" data-source-id="100000009780837"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-25T09:07:25.435Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 25, 2024, 5:07 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Every Friday through the election, Michelle Cottle will highlight outstanding examples of misdeeds, outrageous statements and simply bizarre political behavior.</em></p><p>Donald Trump has been doing his best to make this a boys-versus-girls election: Courting young male voters on bro-focused podcasts. Picking a running mate who seems to have <a href="https://www.self.com/story/jd-vance-views-women" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serious issues with women</a> who don’t fit his views on motherhood.</p><p>It’s a bold political strategy, but it also seems to come from the heart of Trump’s deep-seated misogyny. Witness his professed dismay that Democrats had failed to shield Harvey Weinstein, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/us/harvey-weinstein-trial-deliberations-los-angeles-monday/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">convicted rapist</a> and serial pig, from criminal prosecution. “I was so amazed that Harvey Weinstein got schlonged,” Trump said on “The Dan Bongino Show” this week. “He got hit as hard as you can get hit.”</p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1847858905012908476" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Saturday Night Live&#34; marveled</a>, “In that story, he thinks <em>Harvey Weinstein</em> is the one who got schlonged?”</p><p>But of course he does.

She assured everyone that “we will be following up.”</p><p>I certainly feel comforted by that. You?</p><hr/><p>Trump’s concern for the fauna of Springfield, Ohio, knows no bounds.</p><p>Last weekend, the Fox News host Howard Kurtz <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1848026433781674258" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked</a> the former president why he didn’t just acknowledge that his claim that Springfield’s Haitian community was eating the pets “turned out not to be true.”</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s true or not,” insisted Trump.</p><p>“You don’t know if it’s true or not true?” said Kurtz. “It’s been debunked.”</p><p>“What about the goose — the geese? What about the geese? What happened there? They’re all missing.”</p><p>I’m no ornithologist, but I’m pretty sure that if Springfield’s geese were all missing, we’d know about it by now.</p><hr/><p>The chairman of the Moore County Democratic Party in North Carolina, Lowell Simon, resigned from his position after being <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4937426-north-carolina-democrat-charged-trump-sign-theft/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested and charged</a> last Friday with stealing Trump yard signs.</p><p>I know it’s getting weird out there, but try to hold it together, people.

Hallford Stadium outside Atlanta said they came because they wanted to be part of a show of force for Vice President Kamala Harris in a fiercely contested battleground state.</p><p>“She needs every blessing, every prayer,” Lisa Brooks, of Fayetteville, Ga., said of Harris.</p><p>The introductory speech delivered by Obama hinted at a razor-thin race in which Democrats are fighting not only for independents and anti-Trump Republicans, but also looking to shore up support deep within their base.</p><p>Obama, who recently drew criticism for admonishing Black men, who polls suggest may vote for Trump in larger numbers this year, struck a starkly different note in Georgia, acknowledging the economic pain many voters are feeling, but arguing that Trump is not the answer.</p><p>“I get why people are looking to shake things up,” he said. “What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump would shake things up in a way that’s good for you.”</p><p>A moment later, Obama grew sharper. “He’s trying to sell you gold sneakers,” he said, implying Trump was insulting Black men. “All he cares about is his money, his ego.”</p><p>It was a stronger approach by Obama in the closing days of a tight race. But it felt almost timid compared to the fiery appearance moments earlier by Tyler Perry, the Black filmmaker.</p><p>“This is where I found the American dream for myself,” said Perry, who is now a billionaire but grew up in poverty.</p><p>“I know what it’s like to be homeless here in Georgia,” he said. “I know what it’s like to sleep in my car wrapped in my grandmother’s quilt because I had no place to go.”</p><p>Perry said he remembered where he came from. “I remember the struggle and I also know, hear me, how expensive it is to be poor.”</p><p>Perry said when he was young and broke in the early days of his career, he had watched Trump on television and admired him so much that he checked into a Trump-owned hotel when he finally had the money to do so. Then, he said, he learned about Trump’s history of anti-Black racism. “Research is important. Truth is important. Facts are important,” he said.</p><p>“I didn’t have a father who gave me millions of dollars to start a business,” he said. “Did you?”</p><p>The crowd, filled with thousands of Black voters, roared. Perry ended his remarks by saying he had voted early for Harris earlier in the day. “I could never stand with a candidate who wants America to be a sheet,” Perry said, an allusion to the robes of a Klansman.</p><p>When Harris took the stage, the sense of electric urgency gave way to a stump speech Americans have now heard many times before. Harris’s language was the same she has used for months, calling the election a fight for “the future” and for “freedom.” She’s right, of course. But with fewer than two weeks to go before a deadlocked presidential race with existential consequences, she may want to dig deeper, telling Americans who she is from her heart instead of the script, just like the people who preceded her on the stage in Georgia.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="24" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RjNWU4MzY0LWFmMTUtNTExMi1iMzM0LTg5OTgxY2UyN2FkNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#new-york-liberty-parade-win" data-source-id="100000009780627"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/meher-ahmad"><img alt="Meher Ahmad" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/16/opinion/Meher-Ahmad/Meher-Ahmad-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/16/opinion/Meher-Ahmad/Meher-Ahmad-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/16/opinion/Meher-Ahmad/Meher-Ahmad-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-24T21:00:22.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 24, 2024, 5:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elle Perez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Why does it feel so good to cheer for women’s basketball? It’s a question I asked myself at my first-ever W.N.B.A. game on Sunday night, which also happened to be the Game 5 championship final between the New York Liberty and the Minnesota Lynx. The Liberty clinched the final in a 67-62 nail-biter in overtime, bringing New York City its first basketball championship in 48 years.</p><p>Even when the Liberty weren’t playing at their finest — they scored only 10 points in the first quarter — the fierce crowd watching at Barclays Center in Brooklyn were on their feet, dancing, screaming and yelling for some semblance of defense against the Lynx. I’d heard the buzz around Liberty games all season; the final certainly delivered.</p><p>It’s not just that the franchise has nailed the entertainment side of a basketball game — immaculate music selection; a mascot, Ellie the Elephant, who whips her braid during time outs; an over-40 dance troupe, the Timeless Torches, doing splits mid-game — it’s that the fans have built the team and reaped the W.N.B.A.’s recent success with them. This final garnered <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/10/22/espn-wnba-finals-viewership-record?publicationSource=sbd#:~:text=Liberty&#39;s%20OT%20win%20over%20the,game%20of%20her%20rookie%20season)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2.15 million viewers</a> on ESPN and this W.N.B.A. season was the <a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-delivers-record-setting-2024-season" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most viewed</a> one to date. Sunday’s victory didn’t feel like a win just for New York; it felt like a homecoming for women’s basketball.</p><p>The Liberty’s victory parade through the streets of Lower Manhattan on Thursday morning felt like the feel-good moment of the year for New York sports. Lining the Canyon of Heroes to cheer for our victors were New Yorkers of all stripes: little girls with their moms, women stopping with their laptop bags on their way to work and die-hard fans who waited hours to see the W.N.B.A.’s top players drinking champagne at 10 a.m.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elle Perez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elle Perez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>As I stood among the crowd, I couldn’t help imagining what such a moment would look like if the Knicks could ever again deliver a championship (which they haven’t since I’ve been alive). There would be a bigger crowd, certainly, but I’m sure the fans would have a more aggressive vibe. Ever caught a Knicks fan on a bad day, let alone a good one?</p><p>Liberty fans are raucous, sure, but it’s the kind of raucous that makes a casual or curious bystander want to get up and join in the fun, not walk away quickly lest things take a turn for the worse. For a new fan like me, joining in feels easy and welcome. Maybe that’s why rooting for women’s basketball feels so undeniably good: It’s the pure adrenaline of sports, without the machismo. I can yell “woo” loudly for that.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRhMjAxZDE1LWRiM2QtNTU3NS04NTlkLWE1YzE3ZjU0MTM0Yg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#brics-summit-russia-china" data-source-id="100000009780380"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-24T19:05:44.105Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 24, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>While Americans are intensely focused on our own elections, President Vladimir Putin of Russia played host to leaders who represent nearly half of the world’s population this week. It was more than a photo op — it was a neon sign pointing to just how much has changed in a decade.</p><p>Ten years ago, Russia and China were part of the U.S.-led coalition that was isolating Iran in a bid to curtail its nuclear weapons program. This week, Russia and China welcomed Iran as a new member of a club of emerging economies that demands a bigger say in how the world is run. The group is known as BRICS, named after its founding countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.</p><p>As far as international meetings go, the summit, held in Kazan, Russia, was a success, and not just because of <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-brics-group-and-why-it-expanding" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four new members</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/asia/modi-xi-putin-brics.html" title="">consequential meetings</a> on the sidelines and <a href="https://cdn.brics-russia2024.ru/upload/docs/Kazan_Declaration_FINAL.pdf?1729693488349783" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a joint communiqué that pledged to cooperate</a> more closely on several fronts, including artificial intelligence. Representatives of three dozen countries attended.</p><p>What struck me most was the way it allowed President Xi Jinping of China, the real power behind BRICS, to cast himself as the true protector of a just world order. In <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2024-10-23/Full-text-Xi-Jinping-s-speech-at-the-16th-BRICS-Summit-1xWcSSecSRi/p.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his speech</a>, Xi called for the “swift de-escalation” of the war in Ukraine as well as “an end to the killing” in Gaza and a “comprehensive, just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question.” He also called for reforming the international financial architecture to give non-Western economies like — yes, you guessed it — China more power.</p><p>In the West, Xi’s words will sound empty or cynical. After all, China helped Putin weather the storm of Western sanctions following the brutal invasion of Ukraine. But much of the developing world will agree with him. The destruction in Gaza and now southern Lebanon — by a U.S. ally with U.S. bombs — has outraged many and made it impossible to keep the focus on Putin’s crimes. When Gaza City looks like Mariupol, you’ve lost the moral high ground.</p><p>Xi might be cynical or opportunistic, but he’s not wrong when he says that the world needs de-escalation in Ukraine, a cease-fire in Gaza and global governance reforms. The International Monetary Fund and other Western-led institutions have been frozen in time, reflecting the power dynamics that existed when those institutions were built, not the world of today.</p><p>That’s why the discussion at the other big diplomatic event this week — the I.M.F. and World Bank meetings in Washington — is about changing the quota system that makes the United States the largest shareholder and biggest voice in those institutions. The United States must find a way to make room for emerging economies without capitulating to China. Without that, the appeal of BRICS will only grow.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="21" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RhMzVjNDdmLWNjNDctNWZiNS1iMTZhLWYyZTA5YWU0MzBlOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#friedman-gaza-israel-harris-trump" data-source-id="100000009780239"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-l-friedman"><img alt="Thomas L.

Arab and Muslim Americans with friends and family in Gaza or Lebanon or the West Bank worry every day about loved ones being killed or wounded with U.S.-made weapons that were transferred to Israel. Jewish Americans have had to worry every day about their kids being exposed to left-wing anti-Zionism on U.S. college campuses. That often spills over into antisemitism, which hapless college administrators have often done too little to prevent and too many faculty members mindlessly embrace.</p><p>I understand the concerns of both and they lead me to two pieces of advice: First, however you feel about the Gaza war or what is happening on college campuses, vote for the candidate who is best for the future of America as a whole. And between Trump and Harris, that is unquestionably Harris.</p><p>Trump’s whole approach to politics is to win votes by creating fear of the other, by dividing us between loyal Americans and the enemies within, and by disparaging our allies. We have big, hard things to do as a nation. Big, hard things can only be done together — and bringing Americans together and America and its allies together is not something Trump prioritizes at home or practices abroad. Harris does, and will.</p><p>Second: If you want peace in the Middle East or peace on college campuses when it comes to Middle East issues, it is only going to come about via a president committed to exactly what Harris <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/takeaways-kamala-harris-town-hall/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">advocated</a> in her CNN town hall on Wednesday night: “Bring the hostages home, bring relief to the Palestinian people and work toward a two-state solution, where Israel and the Palestinians — in equal measure — have security.”</p><p>This is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/opinion/israel-hamas-war.html" title="">sole focus</a> of President Biden’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on his current trip to the Middle East.</p><p>As for Trump, one of his biggest donors is Miriam Adelson, the Israeli American widow of Sheldon Adelson, who has <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/15/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/miriam-adelson-donations-trump-super-pac-00183805" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly contributed $100 million</a> to Trump’s campaign. She and her husband <a href="https://www.972mag.com/israel-hayom-voters-netanyahu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">established a giveaway newspaper</a> in Israel for the purpose of supporting Bibi Netanyahu’s far-right government, which is opposed to any two-state solution.</p><p>When Trump was asked in a <a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time magazine interview</a> about a two-state solution, he said that he once believed in it but that Sheldon Adelson told him it was impossible. I shudder at the thought of a president whose views on the Middle East are so influenced by the Adelsons.</p><p>A U.S. administration committed to producing two states for two peoples is the best way to both defuse the crisis in the Middle East and sap the energy of left-wing anti-Zionism on campuses. And if either of those is your top concern, Harris should be your candidate.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBjOTc2M2ViLTIzMzMtNWQxNi1iNDY1LTA0ZDY0MDIzOTZkZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#harris-trump-fascist-town-hall" data-source-id="100000009779697"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bret-stephens"><img alt="Bret Stephens" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-24T09:05:35.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 24, 2024, 5:05 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Kamala Harris came out strong on Wednesday night in her CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper and an audience of undecided voters in Pennsylvania’s Delaware County. She began by citing the testimony of Donald Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, along with his national security advisers, his secretaries of defense, his chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his vice president — all of whom have spoken of his unfitness to serve as president.</p><p>It was persuasive stuff, compellingly delivered — an example of the power of the old journalistic rule about showing rather than telling. Then, in answer to a question from Cooper as to whether she considered Trump to be a “fascist,” she replied, “Yes, yes I do.”</p><p>Uh oh.</p><p>This was bound to be the headline of the evening, which otherwise featured a very familiar Harris repeating lines we’ve heard before. And while the F-word no doubt provided moral comfort for her supporters, it struck me as politically ill judged, for three reasons.</p><p>First, like “racist” or “sexist,” the fascist epithet has lost much of its moral force over the years by dint of overuse. George W. Bush, along with most other past Republican presidents, was also often called a fascist; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/11/04/i-apologize-to-george-w-bush-trump-is-the-really-dangerous-one-is-a-terrible-argument/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even Keith Olbermann later apologized</a> to Bush for the overheated language. To use the word now feels both tired and meaningless.</p><p>Second, by adopting the term as her own, Harris descended from truth-telling — that is, just noting what Trump’s own people said about him — to being a name-caller. It’s the wrong look for a candidate casting herself as a uniter and seeking to win over undecided voters, including prior Trump voters. And though the accusation was aimed at Trump alone, there’s an implication that his supporters must, to some degree, be fascists themselves. It will turn off some portion of an undecided electorate that’s tired of moral hectoring from liberal elites.</p><p>Third, while Trump can rightly be described as demagogic, meanspirited, authoritarian-minded — even a plain old jerk — most people think of fascist regimes as places where secret police terrorize ordinary citizens, free media doesn’t exist and protest is forbidden. That’s probably not what most Americans remember of their experience of the Trump years, when this newspaper more than doubled its circulation and Trump’s loudest critics could be heard from the minute Joe Scarborough woke them up to the hour Rachel Maddow put them to sleep.</p><p>Things could surely be different in a second Trump term, when he will probably surround himself with less-scrupulous advisers than those he employed in the first term. His illiberal instincts, his self-pitying narcissism, his affinity for strongmen and the unforgivable stain of Jan. 6 are reason enough to deny him a second term. Calling him a name only sets that aim back.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzZkMmEyMmUzLTIyOWItNTgzMi1iMDlkLWM0YjRiZWY0YWJiZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#tulsi-gabbard-trump-peace" data-source-id="100000009778932"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-miller"><img alt="Katherine Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-23T22:00:02.226Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 23, 2024, 6:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Each Wednesday in The Point through the election, Katherine Miller highlights a revealing moment from a stump speech on the campaign trail.</em></p><p>On Tuesday night in Greensboro, N.C., about an hour into Donald Trump’s rally there, Tulsi Gabbard appeared onstage to speak.</p><p>The top-line news out of this was that Gabbard is technically joining the Republican Party, but she has been campaigning for Republicans for years. In 2022, I saw her appear with Kari Lake in Arizona, an event that memorably ended with Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” blasting from the outdoor stage. But Gabbard’s speech this week was primarily and specifically about the subject of war and peace:</p><blockquote><p>Today’s Democrat Party is completely unrecognizable, which points to the clear choice that we have in this election today. When you look at the party of Kamala Harris, for example, she is anti-freedom, she is pro-censorship, she is pro-open borders and she is pro-war. Without even pretending to care about peace, as President Trump talked about, she has shamelessly embraced the endorsement and support of warmongers like Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney and others who care more about power and feeding the military-industrial complex than they care about you, the American people, and peace. President Trump has pledged to end wars, not start them, and this is why, in the eyes of the Kamala Harris-Dick Cheney Democrat Party, they will do everything possible to try to destroy him. You’ll see how they have weaponized the federal government; they’ve weaponized law enforcement, the Department of Justice; they have done everything possible to try to silence him, to try and remove him from the ballot so we the people don’t even have the choice of who we want to vote for. Why have they done this? Because this man has the courage to take them on and root out the deep rot of corruption in the swamp in Washington.</p></blockquote><p>A very popular line right now on the right is that the Republican Party traded Liz Cheney for Tulsi Gabbard, and sometimes Robert Kennedy Jr. is included as part of the trade. Tim Walz has a similar line from the other perspective — that the Democratic coalition ranges from Bernie Sanders to Taylor Swift to Dick Cheney. There probably are a handful of Biden administration approaches on foreign policy that the Cheneys would back, but the Cheneys have also been extremely clear that they’re supporting Kamala Harris specifically because of Trump’s relationship to power, not because of Harris’s policy.</p><p>A big theme of the Kennedy and Gabbard campaign for Trump, though, beyond the “Make America Healthy Again” portion of the program, is the idea of Trump as the candidate of peace, both in Ukraine and the Middle East, though the specifics of how those conflicts will be resolved are often pretty unclear. If you listened to Gabbard on Tuesday, she said “peace” repeatedly.</p><p>Earlier this week, Trump sat for an <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/webtv/programs/special-interview/2024/10/20/trump-says-middle-east-peace-possible-if-elected-plans-to-expand-abraham-accords" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> focused on foreign policy with Al-Arabiya, the Saudi television channel, which still rested on something he’s said this entire campaign: None of this — Ukraine, Oct. 7, Gaza — would have happened if he were president. But all of it is currently happening right now, and probably still will be in January, and how Trump actually would deal with a much more chaotic Europe and Middle East is a big, open-ended question that few people seem to have a vividly clear answer about.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzkyZTM1OTg2LWM5ZDktNTMyNS1iODYyLTk5MDUxZThiYmMwNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#harris-coalition-trump-movement-cheney" data-source-id="100000009778730"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-french"><img alt="David French" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-23T19:41:34.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 23, 2024, 3:41 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elconin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The shorthand way to think about the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is as a battle between a movement and a coalition. MAGA is the movement. It has a very specific ethos, a very specific cause, and the zeal that comes along with the sense that you’re part of a revolutionary movement that’s wrecking the existing order.</p><p>MAGA has a high floor and a low ceiling. The ferocity and group solidarity of MAGA means that it’s hard to ever see Trump polling below his 2016 vote share. His support is baked in and unshakable. At the same time, the same characteristics that bind MAGA together repel much of the rest of the country.</p><p>Harris’s coalition, which ranges from Liz Cheney to the Squad of congressional progressives, has a lower floor and a higher ceiling. Harris doesn’t enjoy the cult following of Trump, but there are more Trump opponents than Trump supporters, and if she can extend a welcoming hand to as many people and factions as possible — without alienating other people and factions — then she’ll probably win.</p><p>Coalition-building depends on a meeting of the minds. Each faction within Harris’s tent has to be content with the realization that it’s not going to get everything it wants from a Harris presidency. The factions even have to accept that they’ll sometimes have to outright oppose different Harris policies. And they have to agree to sacrifice for a larger goal.</p><p>That’s the prism through which we should view Harris’s campaign events with Cheney. It’s watching how both partners in the coalition recognize their assignments.</p><p>Make no mistake, everyone is giving up something to join the Harris coalition. Her supporters on the left are forgiving her for backing away from many of the positions she took in 2019. Her supporters on the right aren’t demanding that she conform to their orthodoxy, either.

It is indisputably true, for example, that Reagan ran for office seeking the support of segregationists who had embraced the notoriously racist Alabama governor George Wallace. Reagan’s pursuit of the bigoted vote went virally public in the fall of 1980, when he declared himself a supporter of “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/08/27/reagan-ideologue-pragmatist-boot/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">states’ rights”</a> while campaigning in Mississippi.</p><p>The “states’ rights” pronouncement implied sympathy for the segregationist cause and contempt for the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, which together represented the foundation of Black citizenship in the South. The slogan echoed white supremacists who had argued for generations that the former Confederacy had the right to terrorize and disenfranchise Black people without interference from the federal government.</p><p>The story of how Reagan transformed the Justice Department into an instrument of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/05/opinion/don-t-promote-civil-rights-wrongs.html" title="">“civil wrongs”</a> was widely documented at the time. Less well known is the tale of how the president tried and failed to eliminate federal civil rights enforcement in public schools by abolishing the newly established Department of Education.</p><p>That story is recorded in the largely forgotten <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/24/books/books-of-the-times-956587.html" title="">writings</a> of Terrel H. Bell, Reagan’s first secretary of education, who believed that federal oversight was necessary to improve public schooling and to ensure equal access to education. Bell halfheartedly carried the White House’s water in negotiations with Congress, but the proposal for abolishing his department met resistance from Republicans who viewed it as either extreme or premature.</p><p>Eventually Bell <a href="https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/theses/1364/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">planted a bomb</a> at the heart of the abolition idea when he persuaded the president to establish a national commission that would be charged with assessing the strength of the nation’s schools and determining whether the states could carry the educational load alone.</p><p>The answer, as described in the monumental 1983 report <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/04/29/604986823/what-a-nation-at-risk-got-wrong-and-right-about-u-s-schools" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“A Nation at Risk,”</a> was clearly no. The document, which warned of a rising tide of educational mediocrity, sparked a reform impulse that is still reverberating through the country. Instead of talking about killing the Department of Education, Reagan took on education as an issue — at least rhetorically — and spread the news of “A Nation at Risk” by participating in town halls.</p><p>Boot writes that some administration conservatives labeled the education secretary “comrade Bell” because he maintained that the government had a responsibility to defend the civil rights of schoolchildren. By Bell’s accounting, he was besieged by far-right extremists, some of whom argued that public education itself <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20403138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was unnecessary</a> and that there was no justification for government involving itself in the schooling of its citizens.</p><p>These sentiments are reincarnated in education proposals offered by the Trump-aligned far-right group that put together <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-and-education-a-lot-of-bad-ideas-some-more-actionable-than-others/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the 2025 Project</a>, which also calls for dismantling the department, along with programs like Head Start. Radical changes like these are unlikely to gain legislative support — even if Donald Trump returns to the White House. But true believers who wish to subvert education policy can do a great deal of damage through conventional bureaucratic channels.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzkyM2NiMmViLTExN2MtNTE0OS1iMDMyLWQ4MjcwYjVkY2NmNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#biden-birth-control" data-source-id="100000009776106"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alexandra-ellerbeck"><img alt="Alexandra Ellerbeck" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-23T09:10:13.972Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 23, 2024, 5:10 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Helgas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In a welcome move, the White House finally proposed on Monday a plan to require insurers to cover the cost of over-the-counter birth control, including daily pills, condoms and “plan B” emergency contraceptives, for the first time.</p><p>Now that many women live in states where it is no longer possible to get an abortion, the White House has begun to push to make it easier for Americans to get contraception. More than one-third of women who take birth control pills have missed them because they weren’t able to get their next supply, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/over-the-counter-oral-contraceptive-pills/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> from KFF, a nonprofit health research group. Opill, the first over-the-counter daily birth control pill, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/health/opill-birth-control-nonprescription.html" title="">entered stores</a> this year, was supposed to expand access, but its price — $19.99 a month, which is not generally covered by insurance — is too high. (Only 16 percent of women <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/over-the-counter-oral-contraceptive-pills/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> they would be willing to pay more than $20 a month for an over-the-counter pill).</p><p>The White House’s idea is a good one. But in America, good ideas too often get mired in the complexity and byzantine administrative burdens of our privatized health care behemoth.</p><p>Remember when the Biden administration <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20its%20ongoing,get%20them%20for%20free%20starting" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mandated that insurance companies</a> cover the cost of rapid Covid tests? I celebrated that news, only to realize that it wasn’t so simple. Some insurers made you pay upfront and then submit a claim. This hurdle felt like the world’s most annoying homework assignment. It meant digging up receipts from the bottom of shopping bags, remembering passwords to the insurance portals and navigating poorly designed websites, only to have to wait to be reimbursed. Ultimately, a policy that was meant to revolutionize our approach to Covid was muted by convoluted bureaucracy.</p><p>Making birth control over-the-counter should make it much easier to obtain, but depending on how the White House’s proposed rule is put into practice, it may not be that simple, Alina Salganicoff, a senior vice president at KFF, told me. Instead of checking out at the front of the store, you may need to wait in line at the pharmacy. And what if the pharmacy isn’t in-network? What if you go to Walgreens but your health plan covers only CVS?</p><p>Beyond that, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/10/21/free-birth-control-pills/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has reported</a> that officials have not ruled out the possibility that some consumers will need to buy the product upfront and then seek reimbursement from their health plan, replicating the same problem that plagued Covid tests.</p><p>The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-proposes-rule-to-expand-coverage-of-affordable-contraception-under-the-affordable-care-act/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promoted</a> its plan as “the most significant expansion of contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act” in more than a decade. To deliver on that promise, the administration must reduce as many bureaucratic burdens as possible. In an ideal world, getting many types of birth control should be as simple as it is for many college students to grab a handful of condoms from the student health center. But to get there, our government must realize that red tape is often the biggest obstacle between us and the health care we need.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2VmNWM3MTlhLTg3MDItNTcyOS04YjYyLTQ2MTI2YjBhZDc2Yg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#dimon-gates-trump-harris" data-source-id="100000009776877"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-22T23:01:08.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 22, 2024, 7:01 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Donald Trump’s endless use of intimidation and flattery to get his way is profoundly offensive, but it has also proven to be quite effective. By dangling dreams of big-time executive power, he won the support of the outsize egos of Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And by threatening to denounce any Republican who did not pay him obeisance, he has forced most of the Republican Party to its knees.</p><p>The latest example of the power of his threats is Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank. Dimon has privately told associates that he supports Kamala Harris, and would consider a role in her administration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/business/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-harris-trump.html" title="">The Times reported</a> Tuesday. But will he say so publicly, or use his resources at a moment when it might make a difference? No.</p><p>Dimon has told associates he’s afraid that if Trump wins the election, he will retaliate against any person or company who criticized him. And so he’s staying mum, keeping his checkbook shut and even making <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-08/dimon-says-he-s-still-deciding-on-a-presidential-endorsement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public statements</a> about possibly endorsing Trump.</p><p>Dimon’s fear is certainly legitimate; Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-opponents-enemy-within.html" title="">openly mused</a> about using the military and the power of the executive branch against his enemies. But that’s all the more reason someone of Dimon’s stature should stand up to Trump’s public bullying. No doubt Dimon is concerned about his employees and his stockholders, but he would do them a better service by doing everything possible to prevent Trump’s election.</p><p>Fortunately, there are some people with enough self-assurance to resist Trump’s threats. Bill Gates, one of the founders of Microsoft, recently donated $50 million to Future Forward, the main outside fund-raising group supporting Harris, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/elections/bill-gates-future-forward-kamala-harris.html" title="">The Times also reported on Tuesday.</a> Gates, who rarely talks about his political thinking and generally doesn’t make those kinds of partisan gifts, wouldn’t publicly say that he is supporting Harris, but when asked about the donation he made clear in a statement his reasons for writing the big check:</p><blockquote><p>I support candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change in the U.S. and around the world. I have a long history of working with leaders across the political spectrum, but this election is different, with unprecedented significance for Americans and the most vulnerable people around the world.</p></blockquote><p>Gates is right: This election is different. Trump will never commit himself to goals like that. The stakes are so high that they require people with influence to use their resources in pursuit of a better future than the one offered by Trump.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdhZmVhMDEwLTZjODEtNTFkNS1hMjgwLTdlZWZhOWM2MzA5ZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#why-harris-is-struggling-with-blue-collar-voters-in-detroit" data-source-id="100000009775425"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-22T18:43:47.228Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 22, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Detroit has been getting a lot of love lately. It seems like a day does not go by that Kamala Harris isn’t appearing there with <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/19/lizzo-harris-urge-detroiters-to-vote-early/75755983007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lizzo</a> or <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/19/oprah-winfrey-hosts-kamala-harris-livestream-from-michigan/75277940007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oprah</a> or <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/eminem-to-introduce-barack-obama-kamala-harris-rally-detroit-1236186272/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a>. Donald Trump has been there a lot, even if his message is off-key: At the Detroit Economic Club, he warned the people of Detroit that “our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s our president.” Harris quickly turned that into an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPgQp2VuZwQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ad that focuses on the city’s pride, resilience and remarkable</a> comeback.</p><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BPgQp2VuZwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It was a good ad. And yet, I can’t help noticing something that isn’t so great for the Harris campaign in the city, and it’s about an economic and educational class divide.</p><p>So much of the excitement around her candidacy comes from the strong network of Black sororities and fraternities that make up the city’s social scene — in other words, college-educated folks. For instance, Harris’s own sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, has rolled out a “take 4 or more in ’24” campaign, getting people to commit to bringing four friends or relatives out to vote.</p><p>But blue-collar Black voters seem to express more skepticism about Harris, if not outright support for Trump. I called one of my cousins in the Detroit area — a member of Sigma Gamma Rho, who has thrown herself into campaigning for Harris — and asked if she had the same impression.</p><p>She mentioned the people she knew who were voting for Trump — a hairdresser, a landscaper, a former flight attendant — and told me that yes, there did seem to be a class divide going on. She’s been giving out Harris pins and wristbands. “I’ve had people give it back to me,” she told me. She surmised that Trump’s blue-collar appeal might be related to the celebrities that he surrounds himself with. At a rally in Detroit last week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropf27b_Hwg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump brought the rapper Trick Trick and the former boxer Thomas Hearns onstage</a>.</p><p>But another reason comes to mind. Many blue-collar residents of Detroit went to prison at some point in their lives, instead of college. In the aftermath of mass incarceration, there are <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/sites/detroitmi.localhost/files/2018-04/FairChanceOrdinance.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 100,000 adults</a> in Detroit who have been convicted of a felony, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X21001265#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20of%20the,and%20varies%20substantially%20between%20states." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some 19 million around the country</a>. That’s a lot of people, in a state that Trump won by less than 11,000 votes in 2016.</p><p>Last year Michigan <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/16/1219695211/new-michigan-law-means-people-leaving-prison-will-automatically-be-registered-to" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became the first state in the nation</a> to pass a law that automatically registers people who emerge from prison to vote, and a fair amount of grass-roots effort goes on in Detroit to make sure they do. These former inmates — who often <a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/crains-forum/new-michigan-felony-expungement-law-faces-backlog" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggle to get jobs</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/detroit-city-council-supports-bill-help-formerly-incarcerated-find-housing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">housing</a> because of long-ago convictions — don’t love the idea of electing a prosecutor.

All my life, I’ve followed the New York Mets. I read Mets blogs, follow Mets social media. I obsessively follow Mets games. My team gives my life drama without consequences — a swelling sense of well-being when they are good, the glorious highs of a comeback win, the occasional moments of crushing despair and, because they are the Mets, long decades of languishing mediocrity.</p><p>This season was the most fun I’ve ever had as a sports fan. For the first two months of the season, the team was thoroughly bad and demoralized. The next five months, though, were a string of walk-off home runs, miraculous comebacks, clutch pitching and joyous celebrations. When somebody does something tremendous in my workplace, we don’t dog-pile on one another like children and pour sports drinks on people’s heads. Thanks to the Mets, over the past few months, I got to vicariously experience dozens of those celebrations.</p><p>Two things are great about being a sports fan. First, the miraculous win. We humans love a story of triumph over the odds. I’ve forgotten whole years of my life, but I can still tell you all about the astounding Mets comeback win in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. Years hence, I will be able to tell you about this year’s Francisco Lindor home run that launched the Mets over the Braves or the Pete Alonso home run that took them past the Brewers.</p><p>But there is something even better in sports than the comeback. It’s anticipation. It’s hope. It’s the sensation that some great talent has appeared on the scene who will bring you joy for years to come. It’s the rookie who gets off to a sensational start and carries with him bursts of possibility. It’s the free-agent signing that will bring future stardom to your roster.

The problem is that he is breaking the law while doing it.</p><p>Musk, Donald Trump’s richest backer, started out offering $47 to any registered voter in Pennsylvania or other swing state who referred another registered voter to sign his super PAC’s petition supporting the Constitution. ($47 — get it? There are few public figures whose belief in their own cleverness diverges as sharply from reality as Musk’s.)</p><p>That raised eyebrows among election-law scholars because it trod close to the line of paying people to register to vote, which is a federal crime. Musk then increased the payout to $100 and offered it to both the referrer and the signer of the petition (not as clever as $47 but easier for his accountants). Now Musk says he is handing out $1 million every day until Election Day — not a typo — to a random registered Pennsylvania voter who signs the petition.</p><p>And that’s where his gimmick crosses the line into clear illegality, according to Rick Hasen, a U.C.L.A. law professor who is one of the nation’s top election-law scholars.</p><p>“There’s no problem with having a lottery, at least from the point of view of election law, to pay people to sign a petition,” Hasen told MSNBC on Monday. “The problem is to sign the petition, you have to be, if you go to their website of his PAC, you have to be a registered voter in a swing state.”</p><p>Hasen first covered the issue <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=146397" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on his blog last Saturday</a>, where he cited 52 U.S.C. 10307(c), the federal law that prohibits paying someone or accepting payment “either for registration to vote or for voting.” The penalty is $10,000 or up to five years in prison or both. There are a few minor exceptions to the law, including driving people to the polls and giving employees paid leave to vote. In its manual, the Justice Department distinguishes acts like these because they are done with the intent of making it easier for someone to vote rather than inducing them to register or vote in the first place.</p><p>Musk’s giveaway looks a lot more like inducing than making easier. In a lottery-addled nation like ours, it’s not hard to imagine hordes of unregistered Pennsylvanians rushing to the D.M.V. in the hope of a million-dollar payday. No word yet from the election-integrity hawks who praised Georgia for its 2021 law barring volunteers from giving water and food to voters waiting in hourslong lines.</p><p>Musk appears to be spending at least $18 million for no clear benefit. That may not be a surprise coming from the man who shelled out north of $40 billion to satisfy a personal grudge against the social media site formerly known as Twitter, but its apparent fecklessness is not an excuse for federal prosecutors to ignore it.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBlNzA4MjJmLTUxMGYtNTRiZS04OGZhLWU1OGM0YTc2ZWFiZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#philadelphia-mailers-trump" data-source-id="100000009774335"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-21T22:00:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 21, 2024, 6:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>People who don’t live in swing states probably don’t realize just how much political junk mail (the old-fashioned paper kind) is being delivered to battleground residents in the final days of the presidential campaign. Some Pennsylvania residents, for example, say they’re getting five or six mailers a day, and a vast majority of them are coming from Republican groups or dark-money groups aligned with the Trump campaign.</p><p>Mintt, a company that tracks direct mail, says that it has collected <a href="https://us18.campaign-archive.com/?u=b230aa6a8b06f74ed1a0c6d2b&amp;id=a1aa1923a0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14,000 different mail cards</a> — currently about 1,000 new ones a day — that have gone to millions of households in nine swing states. Through September, about 96 percent of them were pro-Donald Trump or anti-Kamala Harris. Democrats have started to catch up, but four out of five mailers still come from Republicans, and many of them are going to Democratic neighborhoods.</p><p>What’s the point of snail mail in an era when most people communicate by phone? Political consultants have long believed that direct mail is more engaging and substantial than an overflowing email inbox, and people tend to look at what shows up in their home’s mailbox.</p><p>Judging by some of the mail showing up in largely Black neighborhoods in southwestern Philadelphia, which I’ve been collecting, it’s also very easy to lie with little consequence.</p><p>Many of the mail cards directed to those neighborhoods are all about fear of crime. Just as Trump and his party allies have spent months trying to falsely persuade Americans that they are in grave danger of being shot in the street, the mail fliers make that threat explicit. “Crime is rising, Pennsylvanians are less safe,” said one mailer sent out by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/31/trump-dark-money-group-00161122" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Securing American Greatness</a>, a dark-money group (meaning that contributions don’t have to be disclosed) run by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/us/politics/trump-republican-campaigns-cash.html" title="">Taylor Budowich</a>, a former spokesman and former senior adviser to Trump.

She had always wanted a big family but struggled to get pregnant and turned to in vitro fertilization to have her two boys.</p><p>But this pregnancy was not viable: The embryo had attached to scar tissue from a previous C-section, a life-threatening ectopic condition known as “<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10298845/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cesarean-scar pregnancy</a>” for which abortion is the treatment.</p><p>But Florida has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/us/florida-abortion-ban.html" title="">six-week abortion ban</a> and Palmese was six weeks and five days pregnant. Palmese told me in a phone interview her doctor buried his head into his hands. He told her he had reached out to physicians across Florida but none believed they could help, despite the exception in the Florida law for saving the life of the mother. “Everybody said the same thing,” she recalled. “Unless there’s no heartbeat, there’s nothing they can do for me.”</p><p>Palmese was shocked. “If my life isn’t important, what is important?” she said. “Who’s going to take care of my kids if something happens to me?”</p><p>As Americans vote in the coming days, I hope they’ll remember <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/17/opinion/dobbs-roe-abortion-stories.html" title="">the ordinariness with which women in this country have been stripped of their rights</a>, including the right to life, in just two years. I hope they’ll remember that medical complications with pregnancies occur regularly in the states that have banned abortion, forcing women like Palmese into life-threatening situations.</p><p>In her case, she found the care she needed to save her life in New York, at Northwell’s North Shore University Hospital on Long Island. Dr. Michael Leslie Nimaroff, who treated Palmese, told me it was clear based on medical records shared with him from her doctor at home that Florida had denied Palmese critical care. Dr. Nimaroff seemed to be struggling to come to terms with a political landscape in which doctors are being prevented from saving the lives of their patients.</p><p>“My understanding is I don’t understand it,” he told me. “As a health care provider for women, it’s very hard for us to understand not being able to intervene for the mother’s wellness and safety. It goes against what we’re taught.”</p><p>Palmese declined to say for whom she plans to vote in the presidential election. But she said she plans to vote for a Florida ballot initiative, known as Amendment 4, that would establish a right to abortion in the state before viability. “Yes on Four is my stance on it,” she said. “We need to keep government out of health care.”</p><p>Palmese is just one of an estimated 23 million women of reproductive age living under abortion bans since the fall of Roe v. Wade. Some women have died from the bans, or almost died. Others, like Palmese, have been forced to travel great distances to receive life-saving care.</p><p>So long as the bans remain, they are a threat to the dignity and citizenship of every woman in the United States.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ3MzMxNzc2LTQ5YzgtNTgxZC1hMDRmLTgyNjNhZjg4ZmQ2Yg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#trump-chances-tipsheet" data-source-id="100000009772412"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-21T09:04:07.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 21, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans of both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Donald Trump at Sunday night’s game in Pittsburgh.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gene J.

Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>What if undecided voters really aren’t undecided? What if, instead, they’re mostly people who will vote for Donald Trump, but they just don’t want to admit it to pollsters — or themselves?</p></li><li><p>This has been on my mind lately because Kamala Harris and Trump have drawn about as sharp a contrast as I’ve seen in the five presidential races I’ve covered. Harris is campaigning with gusto and her message has been consistent since summer. This is not a complicated choice. I suspect that Harris has won over most of the undecided and swing voters she is going to get, and that Trump is in better shape in the battleground states than the polls suggest — and better positioned to attract late-deciding voters who are often driven by feelings (which I think this year will be about two things: the economy and fear).</p></li><li><p>Why aren’t more “undecideds” saying they’ll vote for Trump? Well, the guy makes it awfully hard for many Nikki Haley Republicans, moderates, independents and others outside his MAGA base to get on the bandwagon with his election-denying, insurrectionist-defending, us-vs.-them bombast. In my three years moderating Times Opinion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/focus-groups" title="">focus groups</a>, I’ve heard embarrassment from some non-MAGA people who voted for Trump. His conduct on Jan. 6, 2021 disgusts many of them. Some are genuinely uncomfortable saying they will vote for him after what he did that day.</p></li><li><p>But at the same time — and this is key — many moderate, independent, swing and undecided voters list the economy as their top issue. And many of them still praise Trump on economic issues. Americans as a rule hate inflation. Many of them fault the Biden-Harris administration. I don’t believe undecided voters who care most about the economy and are pinched by inflation are going to embrace Harris. I see no clear sign in the battleground states that her economic message is convincing large numbers of undecided and swing voters that she will be better on the economy than Trump. Many voters are not looking for a “more of the same” president, and I think her single biggest problem is separating herself from Biden. She hasn’t done it effectively.</p></li><li><p>Harris’s political strategy this week is a signal that her team suspects all of this, too. </p><p>She is campaigning with Liz Cheney in swing states and will be talking about Jan. 6. Maybe Harris and Cheney can turn some of these voters away from Trump, and capitalize on his “enemy within” language and his threats against his critics and opponents. I think Harris is closing out the race with the right issues — the economy, abortion rights, security, Jan. 6 — that resonate with a lot of voters, including suburban women who are crucial to her chances. She’s hoping Michelle and Barack Obama will help with these voters and others, too, when they do their first joint events later this week.</p></li><li><p>Trump’s closing strategy is to make people afraid of a Harris presidency, by maligning her personally or portraying the country as near collapse. He and his allies are bent on making Harris unacceptable to voters.</p><p>If he wins, an under-told story of this campaign may be how effective the Trump camp’s ads on transgender girls and trans rights have been in making Harris look extreme and unacceptable. This week, he is campaigning in North Carolina, Georgia and Nevada, where I expect the fear-mongering to reach a fever pitch with social conservatives, religious voters and some of the Black and Latino men he is trying to win over.</p><p>He knows what he’s doing by sowing anxiety. Harris can’t afford this to be a fear vs. more-of-the-same election.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzlkODdlM2M1LWNhODctNTRhOC04ZjI0LTQxNWVkMDM1MTYzNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/22/opinion/thepoint#luzerne-pennsylvania-harris-support" data-source-id="100000009770622"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-18T21:31:13.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 18, 2024, 5:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>I recently spent the night at my aunt Eleanor’s house, in Luzerne County, Pa., in an old coal mining community near the Poconos that has the odd distinction of having voted twice for Barack Obama and then twice for Donald Trump. I knew I’d reached her driveway when I saw a Harris-Walz sign and another that read, “Lock him up,” next to a security camera that she installed to stop her neighbors from tearing them down. So many Trump signs dotted that old country road that you’d think my aunt was the only Democrat in town.</p><p>But she invited nine of her friends over to talk politics with me, including three Republicans who planned to vote for Kamala Harris. They felt just as passionately as my aunt did, but many said they didn’t want to put up signs. One said she and her husband had moved there recently and didn’t want to rock the boat with their neighbors. Another expressed fear of “weird militias.”</p><p>“People are very nervous what’s going to happen,”<strong> </strong>Becky Loftus, a Puerto Rican woman who married a coal miner’s son from the area, told the group. If Harris wins, there will be violence, she said, and if Trump wins, there will be violence. “It’s a no-win situation.”</p><p>They were not unlike Democrats in other places. They hated Trump — his lies, his policies, his character, his hair. They had all gone through the same emotions as every other Democrat I knew: depression after Trump’s debate with President Biden, skepticism that Harris could lead and then absolute elation when she made it a race again after Biden dropped out. Now they were experiencing a new emotion: political dread of Election Day, when, after all that we as a nation have been through, it will still not be over.</p><p>But it felt good anyway, they said, to gather in the same room and be reminded that they weren’t alone. Records show that there are almost the same number of registered Democrats (87,314) as Republicans in the county (87,724) and there are 22,456 unaffiliated with either party.</p><p>There is no doubt that Trump has deep support here. But perhaps not as deep as one would think from counting signs along these old country roads. Let’s remember that yard signs don’t vote. People do.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
