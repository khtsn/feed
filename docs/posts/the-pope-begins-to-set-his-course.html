    <h1>The Pope Begins to Set His Course</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Pope Leo XIV returned to the Sistine Chapel today to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/09/world/pope-leo-xiv-news" title="">preside over his first Mass</a> since he was elected there to serve as the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church. During his first homily as pope, Leo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/pope-leo-mass-catholic-church.html" title="">evoked the teachings of Francis</a>, his predecessor, pledged to align himself with “ordinary people,” and called for missionary outreach to help heal the “wounds that afflict our society.”</p><p>He will soon confront a number of urgent questions, including who gets a say in determining the future of the church and how to manage the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/pope-leo-xiv-american-church.html" title="">rising right wing</a> in U.S. Catholicism.</p><p>But first, many Catholics are still learning about the new pope, whose name was said to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/name-leo-xiv-history.html" title="">a clear reference to the previous Leo</a>. To many, an American pope was a shock. But other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/pope-leo-cardinal-prevost-obstacles.html" title="">aspects of Leo’s background</a>, especially his time in a senior Vatican role, make him a less surprising pick.</p><p>Cardinal Pablo Virgilio Siongco David of the Philippines said “it matters a lot that we have a pope and a spiritual leader whose heart is for migrants.” He added: “I think he will sustain the direction of Pope Francis.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Other cardinals who were at the conclave explained what happened behind the scenes:</p><p>Cardinal Wilton Gregory of Washington, D.C., said that Leo engaged “quite effectively” in small group discussions. Cardinal Robert McElroy, Gregory’s successor as Washington’s archbishop, said in a news conference that Leo’s American identity was “almost negligible” in the conclave, almost surprisingly so.</p><p>Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, from the Philippines, described Leo as levelheaded, calm and humorous. Tagle sat beside him during the conclave and offered him a candy when he noticed the soon-to-be pope breathing deeply. “That was my first act of charity to the future pope,” Tagle said.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>The pope’s eldest brother, Louis Prevost, told us <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/pope-leo-xiv-brother-louis-prevost.html" title="">about their boyhood in Illinois</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pakistani security personnel in Karachi today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rizwan Tabassum/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-56b58789">The India-Pakistan conflict escalated</h2><p>Gunfire and shelling battered the disputed borderlands of India and Pakistan today, as the two nuclear-armed countries launched attacks in their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/09/world/india-pakistan-kashmir" title="">most expansive military conflict in decades</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For my colleague Hari Kumar, a reporter in New Delhi, this week’s attacks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-1971.html" title="">recalled memories of the last major war</a> between India and Pakistan, in 1971.

Bush, is remembered for surprising the man who appointed him. He became a mainstay of the court’s liberal wing, leading conservatives to insist on “no more Souters” when later Republican presidents had court seats to fill. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/david-souter-dead.html" title="">He died yesterday at 85</a>.</p><p>Our Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/supreme-court-souter-legacy.html" title="">wrote about Souter’s legacy</a> and his decision to retire at the relatively young age of 69. “He was so old-school that it almost seemed like he never really caught up to electricity,” one of his clerks said.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The location of Kosmos-482 as of this afternoon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">By William B.
