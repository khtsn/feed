    <h1>Trump Defended Musk’s Cost-Cutting Effort</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump offered praise today for Elon Musk and his team at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, who have led the administration’s effort to purge federal workers. He said he had directed them to search across the government for costs to eliminate. He mentioned in particular that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-pentagon.html" title="">Musk would scrutinize spending at the Pentagon</a>, from which Musk has received at least $3.6 billion in contracts over the past decade.</p><p>The president also singled out the Education Department, which the White House has discussed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/education-dept-elon-musk-senate.html" title="">possibly shutting down</a>. Trump’s critics <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/congress-trump-spending.html" title="">argue that the efforts violate the Constitution</a>, which grants Congress the authority to dictate federal spending.</p><p>But in just the past week, Musk and his team have descended on Education, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs Departments, among other agencies. The Treasury Department installed an ally of Musk to oversee the nation’s payment system, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/treasury-musk-doge-payment-system.html" title="">replacing a career civil servant</a>.</p><p>Musk’s effort is largely being carried out by a group of male engineers, including some recent college graduates and at least one as young as 19. Some are former interns at his companies; others are executives who have worked for Musk for as long as two decades. They all appear to have channeled his shoot-first, aim-later approach. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/musk-doge-aides.html" title="">Here’s what we know about Musk’s team of young aides.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>U.S.-funded food aid delivered to Bentiu, South Sudan, in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The judge, Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, said the imminent administrative leave of 2,200 employees would be briefly delayed while he heard a legal challenge filed by unions representing the workers. The unions have called Trump’s efforts to dismantle the agency “unconstitutional and illegal,” and said that they had “generated a global humanitarian crisis.”</p><p>Earlier today, the president issued a blunt, all-caps directive to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/usaid-trump.html" title="">dissolve U.S.A.I.D.</a> “CLOSE IT DOWN!” Trump posted on his social media network.
