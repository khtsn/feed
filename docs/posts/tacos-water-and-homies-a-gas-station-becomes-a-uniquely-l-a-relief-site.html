Carne asada sizzled on a grill at a pop-up taco stand in the corner. A group of old friends sat on camping chairs and passed around a freshly rolled blunt, cracking jokes and showing each other photos on their phones. Hip-hop played on a wireless speaker.</p><p>This is not what a disaster scene is supposed to look like.</p><p>Yet somehow this filling station, perched across the street from one of the most destructive wildfires in California’s history, had suddenly become the vibrant hub of a traumatized neighborhood, a harbor for residents desperate for food, clothes and, especially, community.</p><p>The Arco station, otherwise known for cheap fuel, could no longer serve its primary purpose once the Santa Ana winds bore down on the neighborhood on Jan. 7 and knocked out its power. What it had instead was proximity to the fire zone and the ingenuity of locals.</p><p>Just feet from the taco stand were a dozen tables piled with donated shirts, blankets and toiletries that were meticulously organized. A moving van loaded with cases of water, boxes of chips and crates of diapers backed into the gas station.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And in the center of it all stood Jorge Trujillo, who had helped to build a full-fledged relief operation overnight.</p><p>“Nothing was planned,” Mr. Trujillo, 37, said as he watched the scene. “Everyone just gravitated here.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
