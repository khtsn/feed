    <h1>Hugh Hewitt Quits The Washington Post</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hugh Hewitt, the conservative pundit, said on Friday that he would no longer write columns for The Washington Post, where he had been a regular contributor to the paper’s opinion pages.</p><p>Mr. Hewitt’s decision to quit The Post came hours after he abruptly stormed off a broadcast of a live online Post talk show, “First Look,” where he had expressed frustration with his fellow panelists, the Post columnists Jonathan Capehart and Ruth Marcus.</p><p>Mr. Hewitt objected to claims during the broadcast that former President Donald J. Trump was laying groundwork to potentially contest the election results, prompting Mr. Capehart to reply, “I don’t appreciate being lectured.”</p><p>Mr. Hewitt, who was speaking via video, tore out his in-ear headset.</p><p>“I’m done, I’m done,” he said. “This is the most unfair election ad I’ve ever been a part of.” He stood up from his chair and left. His camera remained focused on an empty room.</p></div></div>
