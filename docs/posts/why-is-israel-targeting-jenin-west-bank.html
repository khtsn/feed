The city has for decades been a hotbed of militancy and a target of raids by Israeli security forces.</p><p>Since the war in Gaza began, Hamas has been increasingly popular and asserted its presence in the West Bank. Iran — which backs Hamas and other militant groups in the region — has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/world/middleeast/iran-west-bank-weapons-smuggling.html" title="">flooded the territory with weapons</a>. And the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank in coordination with Israel, has seen its tenuous influence further diminish.</p><p>Now, Israel seems to be focusing its attention on the West Bank, and Jenin in particular. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel’s latest operation was aimed at “eradicating terrorism” and that it would be “extensive and significant.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Here’s what to know about Jenin and Israel’s latest operation there.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-113be5e5">What is happening?</h2><p>On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Israeli military said that 10 militants had been “hit” during the operation in Jenin, without giving further details. Earlier, Israel said that it had killed eight militants since the start of the raid.</p><p>The Palestinian health ministry said that 10 people had been killed in Jenin and its outskirts since the start of the raid. And Palestinian officials cited by Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency, said that at least four people had been injured in the city on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli soldiers run to take position in Jenin during the second day of an Israeli military operation on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alaa Badarneh/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Other West Bank cities were also targeted in raids.
