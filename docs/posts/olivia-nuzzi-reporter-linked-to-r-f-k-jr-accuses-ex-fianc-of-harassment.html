Kennedy Jr., has accused her former fiancé of a campaign of harassment and blackmail, according to court filings.</p><p>In a complaint filed in Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Ms. Nuzzi accused the former fiancé, Ryan Lizza, a top political reporter at Politico, of hacking her devices and stealing a device to surveil her and collect materials to pressure her back into a relationship with him.</p><p>She accused Mr. Lizza of bringing “damaging information” to the attention of her employer and of distributing materials to the media that she said she believed to be doctored.</p><p>She also claimed in the complaint that Mr. Lizza had threatened her with violence to coerce her into assuming his financial responsibility in a joint book contract, and “explicitly threatened to make public personal information about me to destroy my life, career and reputation — a threat he has since carried out.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Tuesday, the court granted Ms. Nuzzi a temporary protection order against Mr. Lizza, which requires him to have no contact with Ms. Nuzzi, and ordered him to “immediately cease using any illegally obtained information.”</p><p>Mr. Lizza said the allegations against him were not true. “I am saddened that my ex-fiancée would resort to making a series of false accusations against me as a way to divert attention from her own personal and professional failings,” he said. “I emphatically deny these allegations, and I will defend myself against them vigorously and successfully.”</p><p>Ms. Nuzzi told The New York Times that she had also made similar accusations to the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week. The F.B.I. declined to comment.</p><p>On Tuesday night, a Politico spokesman said Politico and Mr. Lizza had “mutually agreed that it is in everyone’s best interest for him to step back and take a leave of absence” while an internal investigation is conducted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Lizza, the chief Washington correspondent for Politico, has denied all accusations against him.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Morigi/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ms. Nuzzi’s relationship with Mr. Kennedy, whom she profiled last year when he was running for president, came to light in September after the editor of New York magazine asked her about it. In a statement at the time, Ms. Nuzzi said that the relationship had at times “turned personal” but that it had not been physical. Mr. Kennedy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/elections/rfk-jr-suspends-campaign-presidential-race.html" title="">ended his independent run</a> for president in August and has since endorsed former President Donald J.
