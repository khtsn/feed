Biden Jr. on the day of President Trump’s inauguration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump said he was revoking former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s security clearances on Friday as retribution for Mr. Biden having rescinded his four years ago in response to what Mr. Biden called Mr. Trump’s “erratic behavior” around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.</p><p>Mr. Trump made no effort to disguise his reasoning. He did not accuse Mr. Biden of any security breaches. Instead, he wrote on social media that there was “no need” for Mr. Biden to continue having access to classified information, exactly parroting the justification Mr. Biden offered in 2021 for denying briefings to Mr. Trump.</p><div><p>“Joe, you’re fired. Make America Great Again!” Mr. Trump wrote in his signature all-caps style.</p><p>As a practical matter, the decision will have little import. Former presidents get episodic briefings partly as a courtesy, and partly because, in times of a more bipartisan spirit, sitting presidents sometimes call former occupants of the office for advice, or to ask about their experience in handling a delicate diplomatic negotiation.</p><p>But there seems to be no chance of Mr. Trump ever calling his predecessor. Instead, the security clearance revocation serves primarily to add to a remarkable list of grievance-driven acts by Mr. Trump in his first 19 days in office.</p><p>The president has already withdrawn federal protection for five former members of his first administration. Those included some officials — former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser — whom a stream of intelligence suggests Iran has plotted to kill.</p><p>On the first day of his presidency, Mr. Trump signed an order revoking the security clearances for 51 former senior intelligence officials who signed an open letter in 2020 saying that the discovery of a laptop owned by Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden’s son, “has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” Later investigation found no apparent Russian involvement.</p><p>But even then, Mr. Trump stopped short of going after his predecessor, who earlier in the day he had waved goodbye to as Mr. Biden left the Capitol in a helicopter.</p><p>That hesitance ended on Friday evening, as Mr. Trump headed to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate and club. He then plans to go to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl on Sunday.</p><p>“I think it is just performative,” Beth Sanner, who gave Mr. Trump his highly classified Presidential Daily Brief during his first term, said in an interview on Friday night.</p><p>“The only reason a former president needs briefing is to prepare before they speak to foreign leaders, or because they have some other kind of engagement that relates to foreign policy,” Ms. Sanner said. “But there is no real reason to do it except before those moments, and in this case it’s hard to imagine Biden is really going to need it.”</p><p>In his social media posting, Mr. Trump cited an investigation by Robert K. Hur, a special counsel appointed to examine how a number of classified documents from Mr. Biden’s time as vice president ended up in his garage. (Unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden was not prosecuted over his handling of classified material.)</p><p>“The Hur Report revealed that Biden suffers from ‘poor memory’ and, even in his ‘prime,’ could not be trusted with sensitive information,” Mr. Trump wrote, in the latter case misstating the report’s findings. “I will always protect our national security.”</p><p>The timing was curious: All week there have been questions about whether young employees of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency had appropriate security clearances to enter payment systems in the Treasury Department, or gain access to personnel records at the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, acting on his behalf, were dismantling.</p><p>Mr. Trump was clearly riled by the memory, four years ago, of how Mr. Biden stripped him of his clearance.</p><p>“What value is giving him an intelligence briefing?” Mr. Biden said in an interview with Norah O’Donnell of CBS News at the time. “What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?”</p><p>Mr. Biden’s move to deprive Mr. Trump of the traditional briefings was surprising at the time: Continued briefings for ex-presidents have been an institutional staple of Washington for decades, a bipartisan tradition in an era of greater and greater partisanship. But in breaking a precedent, it also seemed to create one.</p><p>The obvious question raised by Mr. Trump’s action is whether he considers it a final settling of scores between the country’s second-oldest and oldest presidents, or whether it is an opening salvo.</p><p>Already this week Mr. Trump has been hunting down Biden-era appointees and firing them, even from institutions — like the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts or Voice of America — that have long enjoyed an air of bipartisanship. Republicans in Congress have promised more investigations into the Biden presidency, which Mr. Trump often called the “Biden Crime Family,” which could put those close to Mr. Biden in legal jeopardy.</p><p>Theoretically, Mr. Trump could even pull Mr. Biden’s Secret Service detail. But that seems unlikely, because it could invite reciprocal action against Mr. Trump when he leaves office.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzJlNTU5MjZmLWYyYTctNTZjMy05ZGNhLWZiNGQzMzRiNzUxMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#trump-musk-time-magazine-cover" data-source-id="100000009978134"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-mccreesh"><img alt="Shawn McCreesh" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T02:24:05.111Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 7, 2025, 9:24 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-mccreesh" itemprop="name">Shawn McCreesh</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzJlNTU5MjZmLWYyYTctNTZjMy05ZGNhLWZiNGQzMzRiNzUxMA=="><a href="#trump-musk-time-magazine-cover">Will a Time magazine cover drive a wedge between Trump and Musk?</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The latest cover of Time magazine depicts Elon Musk sitting behind President Trump’s desk.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">TIME photo illustration</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The president did not look amused. He was meeting the Japanese prime minister for the first time on Friday when a reporter shouted out to ask if he had a “reaction” to the new cover of Time magazine. The cover, the reporter told Mr. Trump, depicts “Elon Musk sitting behind <em>your </em>Resolute Desk.”</p><p>“No,” Mr. Trump answered pointedly. He looked down at the floor. The next few seconds stretched like an eternity as a translator related the exchange to the prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, in Japanese.</p><div><p>Just in case any of the sauciness of the moment had been lost in translation, Mr. Trump waited until the interpreter had finished and then cracked: “Is Time magazine still in business? I didn’t even know that.” Everyone around him laughed gamely, if a bit nervously.</p><p>It is unlikely that Mr. Trump didn’t know whether Time magazine was still in business. His own face had, after all, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/style/donald-trump-time-stock-exchange.html" title="">stared out from its cover</a> only two months ago, when the magazine anointed him its “Person of the Year.” As part of the rollout of that issue, Mr. Trump rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in front of a blown-up version of the cover.</p><p>It is pretty much Trumpology 101 that the president has a long-held fixation with the cover of Time, a durable totem of the 1980s, from which most of his cultural touchstones derive even today. He has always held up its cover as an indication of status, going as far as to mock up fake versions featuring himself.</p><p>The last time he was president, a Time cover in 2017 featuring his adviser Stephen K. Bannon at the height of his powers — “The Great Manipulator,” it read — was believed to have annoyed Mr. Trump. Mr. Bannon left the White House later that year.</p><p>No one can say if the magazine still holds as much sway over Mr. Trump as it did then. One thing seems certain, though, and that is that Mr. Musk appeared eager to stay on Mr. Trump’s good side. On Friday morning, a few hours after the new Time cover dropped, Mr. Musk posted on the social media platform he owns to flatter the president, writing, “I love <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@realDonaldTrump</a> as much as a straight man can love another man.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad0"><div id="ad-0" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FjY2ViZTkyLTg2N2UtNTAyYy05NDVkLTU2MThmY2I2MWI4NA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#medical-research-funding-cuts-university-budgets" data-source-id="100000009978172"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett"><img alt="Christina Jewett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/reader-center/author-christina-jewett/author-christina-jewett-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T02:13:36.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 7, 2025, 9:13 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett" itemprop="name">Christina Jewett</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FjY2ViZTkyLTg2N2UtNTAyYy05NDVkLTU2MThmY2I2MWI4NA=="><a href="#medical-research-funding-cuts-university-budgets">A Trump policy change will restrict billions in funding for medical research programs at universities.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Md., last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hailey Sadler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The National Institutes of Health announced a new policy Friday to cap a type of funding that supports medical research at universities, a decision that most likely will leave many with a large budget gap. The policy targets $9 billion in so-called indirect funds that the N.I.H. sends along with direct funds to support research into basic science and treatments for diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer’s to diabetes.</p><p>Currently, some universities get 50 percent or more of the amount of a grant in indirect funds to maintain facilities and equipment and pay support staff. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The new policy</a> would cap those indirect funds at 15 percent.</p><div><p>“I think it’s going to destroy research universities in the short term, and I don’t know after that,” said Dr. David A. Baltrus, a University of Arizona associate professor whose lab is developing antibiotics for crops. “They rely on the money. They budget for the money. The universities were making decisions expecting the money to be there.”</p><p>Dr. Baltrus said that his research is focused on efforts such as keeping E. coli bacteria out of crops like sprouts and lettuce. He said the policy change would force his university to make cuts to support staff and overhead.</p><p>The Trump administration has been sharply critical of what it derides as “woke” policies and cultures at universities, which have been bracing for a hit to their budgets. Project 2025, a set of conservative policy proposals, called for capping these related research funds, saying they were sometimes used to fund diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Cutting such costs would “reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,” Project 2025’s authors said.</p><p>An N.I.H. <a href="https://x.com/NIH/status/1888004759396958263" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a> said the change could save the federal government as much as $4 billion and sharply cut payments to Harvard, Yale and Johns Hopkins Universities, which have overhead rates above 60 percent of their grant sums.</p><p>Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington, said in a statement late Friday that the move could “dismantle the biomedical research system, stifle the development of new cures for disease, and rip treatments away from patients in need.”</p><p>She said the change could shut down some clinical trials at institutions in her state, such as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and University of Washington.</p><p>The N.I.H. spent about $35 billion in 2023 on about 50,000 competitive grants to about 300,000 researchers at 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions nationwide, according to the new policy. Of that, about $26 billion directly funded research and $9 billion covered indirect costs. The policy is set to take effect Monday.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvM2ZkMjc3M2UtYmNmMi01NTdjLTk0ZGYtZDVkMjdkZWNmMzJi"><div id="3fd2773e-bcf2-557c-94df-d5d27decf32b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#3fd2773e-bcf2-557c-94df-d5d27decf32b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-robertson"><img alt="Katie Robertson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/30/reader-center/author-katie-robertson/author-katie-robertson-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/30/reader-center/author-katie-robertson/author-katie-robertson-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/30/reader-center/author-katie-robertson/author-katie-robertson-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T01:51:25.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 7, 2025, 8:51 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-robertson" itemprop="name">Katie Robertson</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>The Trump administration said it was doubling the number of major news outlets it will remove from their office space at the Pentagon, rotating in a slew of largely conservative media organizations such as Newsmax and The Daily Caller. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/business/media/pentagon-press-corps.html" title="">Pentagon previously notified</a> The New York Times, NPR, NBC News and Politico that they would have to leave their offices, though they would still have press access.

In 2018, he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-under-fire-claim-large-scale-killing-white-farmers-south-n903171" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered his secretary of state</a> to look into “the large scale killing of farmers” — a claim disputed by official figures and the country’s biggest farmers’ group.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s recent comments were in reference to a policy that President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa signed into law last month.</p><p>The law, known as the Expropriation Act, repeals an apartheid-era law and allows the government in certain instances to acquire privately held land in the public interest without paying compensation — something that can be done only after a justification process subject to judicial review.</p><p>The order from Mr. Trump came a day after Mr. Ramaphosa delivered his State of the Nation address with a defiance that appeared to be a reference to the American president’s accusations.</p><p>“We will not be bullied,” he said. The South African leader vowed to stand united in the face of what he called “the rise of nationalism and protectionism.” </p><p>“We will speak with one voice in defense of our national interest, our sovereignty and our constitutional democracy,” he said.</p><p>In addition to the halt in foreign aid, Mr. Trump ordered officials to provide “humanitarian” assistance to Afrikaners and to allow members of the white South African minority to seek refuge in the United States through the American refugee program.</p><p>Since the transition to democracy in 1994, the South African government has taken a willing-seller approach to try to transfer the ownership of more land to the country’s Black majority. The new law, with limited exceptions to that approach, came as many Black South Africans have argued that Nelson Mandela and other leaders did not do enough to force the white minority to give up wealth that had been accrued during apartheid.</p><p>South Africa’s colonial regimes were particularly brutal in dispossessing Black people of their land and forcefully removing them. Despite the efforts of postcolonial governments, the result remains clear to this day: White South Africans, who make up 7 percent of the population, own farmland that covers the majority of the country’s territory.</p><p>In an earlier executive order, Mr. Trump had demanded a three-month pause in the United States’ refugee program, blocking the admission of desperate people fleeing war, economic strife, natural disasters or political persecution. Friday’s order appeared to make white South Africans an exception to the broader halt.</p><p>While it is not clear whether he had an influence on the president’s order, Elon Musk, the billionaire who has become a close adviser to the president, is from South Africa. In 2023, Mr. Musk posted similar far-right conspiracy claims about South Africa on X, the social media platform he owns.</p><p>“They are openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa,” <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1686037774510497792" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Musk wrote</a>.</p><p>Mr. Ramaphosa and Mr. Musk spoke by phone after that social media post, with the South African president trying to clarify what his administration has called “misinformation” peddled by Mr. Trump.</p><p>In much of South Africa, Mr. Trump’s attacks in recent days inspired a rare bit of political unity, with leftist, centrist and even some far-right activists all saying that the American president’s characterization of the land transfer law was wrong.</p><p>His comments amplified a long-held grievance among some white South Africans who claim they have been discriminated against by the Black-led government after apartheid. But Mr. Trump’s comments also angered many South Africans, who saw the law as a necessary means of redressing historical injustice.</p><p>Since 1994, when South Africa became a democracy, the country has enjoyed a close relationship with the United States. Barack Obama visited there several times during his presidency, including when he attended the memorial service for Mr. Mandela, who had been imprisoned for 27 years before becoming the country’s president.</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s actions on Friday made it clear that he does not view the relationship in the same way.</p><p>South Africa received more than $400 million in aid from the United States in 2023, almost all of which went to funding efforts to fight H.I.V. and AIDS. The government has said that American funding makes up about 17 percent of its budget for battling H.I.V.</p><p>Far-right white Afrikaners applauded Mr. Trump’s attacks on South Africa’s government in recent days.</p><p>Ernst Roets, the executive director of the Afrikaner Foundation, which lobbies for international support of the interests of Afrikaners, said that while the government was not seizing land, it was trying to create a legal and policy framework to be able to do so.</p><p>The expropriation law opens the door to abuse, Mr. Roets said, because the government “can justify a lot of things under the banner of public interest.” But even Mr. Roets and his group had not called on Mr. Trump to broadly cut aid to South Africa, instead seeking targeted actions against government leaders.</p><p>After Mr. Trump first commented about land confiscation, the South African government tried to broker a conversation between its foreign minister and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, according to Ebrahim Rasool, South Africa’s ambassador to the United States. But the Trump administration did not respond, he said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad1"><div id="ad-1" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M0N2FjOTExLWYxOGUtNWFiMS04OTNmLTZlN2E4MzIzZmYyZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#newsom-bills-fighting-trump" data-source-id="100000009970444"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/laurel-rosenhall"><img alt="Laurel Rosenhall" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/07/reader-center/author-laurel-rosenhall/author-laurel-rosenhall-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/07/reader-center/author-laurel-rosenhall/author-laurel-rosenhall-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/07/reader-center/author-laurel-rosenhall/author-laurel-rosenhall-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T01:03:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 7, 2025, 8:03 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/laurel-rosenhall" itemprop="name">Laurel Rosenhall</a></p><p>Reporting from Sacramento</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M0N2FjOTExLWYxOGUtNWFiMS04OTNmLTZlN2E4MzIzZmYyZQ=="><a href="#newsom-bills-fighting-trump">Newsom signs bills to fight Trump in California, including legal aid for immigrants.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

Gavin Newsom of California signed legislation on Friday that authorized $50 million in state funds intended to counter the president’s agenda.</p><p>Half of the money was dedicated to legal aid, including for undocumented immigrants who have faced deportation threats from the Trump administration, and the other half was intended to cover additional state litigation costs as California spars with the federal government in court.</p><div><p>Mr. Newsom signed a pair of bills with no news cameras, bringing to a quiet end an effort he launched with vigor two days after the election. Three months ago, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/newsom-trump-california.html" title="">asked state lawmakers</a> to move quickly to defend the state from presumed incursions by Mr. Trump and called for a special legislative session.</p><p>The governor seemed to be positioning himself as a national <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/newsom-trump-california.html" title="">leader of the Democratic resistance</a> in the days following the election. But he has treaded more cautiously in recent weeks after the president threatened to withhold disaster aid from California. On Wednesday, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/gavin-newsom-trump-california.html" title="">met with Mr. Trump</a> for more than an hour in the Oval Office.</p><p>The bills signed by Mr. Newsom passed on a party-line vote, but proved trickier than first thought in the state’s Democratic-led Legislature as Mr. Trump and Republican state lawmakers have tried to distinguish between the deportation of criminal undocumented immigrants and others they say they are not targeting for now.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers, in an attempt to inoculate themselves from arguments that they were using state dollars to help violent offenders, added a message to clarify that the state legal aid was not meant to help immigrants with criminal backgrounds — a clear acknowledgment of Republican criticisms and the mood of the electorate.</p><p>Mr. Newsom also made that point in a signing statement. “None of the funding in this bill is intended to be used for immigration-related legal services for noncitizens convicted of serious or violent felonies,” the governor wrote. </p><p>He encouraged legislators to pass a new law making it clear that this funding will be allocated based on restrictions in existing state law. Those restrictions prohibit people convicted of violent felonies from benefiting from state grants for immigration-related legal services.</p><p>Earlier this week, the legislation set off fiery debate in the State Capitol. Republicans argued that the special legislative session called by Mr. Newsom was an ill-timed political stunt that would harm California’s efforts to seek federal funding to help Los Angeles recover from last month’s wildfires, which killed 29 people and leveled thousands of homes. Democrats, who hold more than two-thirds of the state legislative seats, pressed the need to gird for legal battles with the Trump administration.</p><p>“Californians are being threatened by an out-of-control administration in Washington that doesn’t care about the Constitution, that thinks there are no limits to its power,” <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-07/robert-rivas-california-assembly-speaker-rural-small-town-big-political-power" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert Rivas</a>, the Democratic Assembly speaker, said as lawmakers passed the bills on Monday. “I can say with clarity: We do not trust President Donald Trump.”</p><p>Democratic state legislators had planned to send the bills to Mr. Newsom last week, but Republicans raised concerns that the legal aid could help defend immigrants accused of violent crimes. They emphasized that message in Sacramento the same week that Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-signs-laken-riley-act.html" title="">signed the Laken Riley Act</a>, which calls for the authorities to detain unauthorized immigrants who are charged with crimes ranging from violent offenses to misdemeanors such as burglary and shoplifting.</p><p>“The least you could do is stop spending taxpayer funds to keep violent criminals in our country,” said Carl DeMaio, a Republican assemblyman.</p><p>The argument initially concerned some Democrats, and State Assembly leaders postponed their vote while they sought assurances that the legislation as written wouldn’t wind up helping people with criminal records.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html" title="">rightward shift</a> that the nation experienced in the last election was evident in California state contests as well. Republicans <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-12-08/la-me-california-assembly-republican-jeff-gonzalez" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flipped three state legislative seats</a> previously held by Democrats, and Mr. Trump won 10 counties that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. carried in 2020.</p><p>Two of the counties fell partly in a Central Valley district represented by Esmeralda Soria, a Democratic assemblywoman. Yet she said she had no qualms about voting for the legal aid bill to support undocumented immigrants.</p><p>“When you talk to people in my district, they care about our local economy, and they understand that we need immigrants,” she said. “Who’s going to pick their fruit and vegetables?”</p><p>The legislation lays the groundwork for California to resume its role of jousting with the federal government. The state sued the Trump administration more than 100 times during the president’s first term and has been involved in three lawsuits challenging his orders since Mr. Trump re-entered the White House last month.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzY2NjUwNzk3LTlkNGEtNTRkOC1hOWU1LTNjM2Q2M2U3ZWVkMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#child-protection-group-told-to-comply-with-trumps-gender-order" data-source-id="100000009978129"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-h-keller"><img alt="Michael H.

But it told The New York Times that it would not alter its approach in helping children of all identities in crisis. “Our mission is unchanged,” said Derrick Driscoll, the group’s chief operating officer.</p><p>It was a forceful response to a far-reaching order from the White House last month, requiring the federal government to recognize only two sexes: male and female. The Justice Department told the group, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, to review all of its public-facing materials for compliance.</p><div><p>After news of the request spread online, some expressed concern that any changes could harm L.G.B.T. youth, who are at particular risk for sex trafficking, or result in transgender children being called by their birth name, a practice referred to as “deadnaming,” which could impede investigations.</p><p>But Mr. Driscoll, in an interview, said the directive would have “no impact on our operational programs.” When asked how it could affect Amber Alerts involving transgender children, he said the center’s longstanding policy remained the same: “Whatever name is reported to us by the parents or law enforcement is what we use,” he said.</p><p>The center helps distribute Amber Alerts when children are abducted and serves as a clearinghouse for reports of online child sexual abuse material, which it shares with law enforcement agencies around the country.</p><p>While it operates as a private nonprofit, it receives about 80 percent of its funding from the federal government. For the current year, that figure totaled around $40 million in grants.</p><p>The national center was founded by John and Revé Walsh after their son was abducted and later found murdered in the 1980s.</p><p>It has received bipartisan support since its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121029010231/http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=4362" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creation</a> was announced by President Ronald Reagan.

Others said they intended to keep going.</p><div><p>In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has welcomed federal money to build 19 E.V. charging stations, Breanna Badanes, a spokeswoman for the state’s Transportation Department, said Friday that “it’s safe to say we’re not sure” how or whether the state will build more.</p><p>“Those stations will continue operating, but as far as what comes next, we’re in the same boat with everyone else, just trying to figure it out,” she said.</p><p>The Feb. 6 memo signed by Emily Biondi, an associate administrator at the U.S. Transportation Department, said that the administration was “suspending approval of state electric vehicle infrastructure deployment plans.” The memo singled out the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program, which was authorized under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.</p><p>A national network of fast charging stations was part of President Joseph R. Biden’s Jr.’s effort to combat climate change by accelerating the nation’s transition to electric vehicles.</p><p>Under the program, states were to receive $5 billion to build 500,000 charging stations by 2030. To date, about $3.3 billion has been allocated to states. Of that, $511 million has been awarded in contracts but only $40 million has been spent, according to Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, a research firm.</p><p>Asked to clarify whether the freeze applied to the money that has been allocated but not awarded by states to contractors, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department wrote in an email, “During this process, no new obligations may occur under the program, but reimbursement of existing obligations will continue in order to not disrupt current financial commitments.”</p><p>The memo seems to align with President Trump’s opposition to federal support for electric vehicles. He has promised to revoke pollution limits on automobiles that were designed to increase sales of zero-emissions cars, and to end federal tax credits of up to $7,500 to buyers of electric vehicles.</p><p>But, “different people seem to be reading it differently,” said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.</p><p>Some state officials said they believed that the administration intends to pull back unspent money that has already been allocated to the states by formula — a move that would be unheard-of, as such formula funding “has been the bedrock of federal-state partnership for 100 years,” Mr. Tymon said.</p><p>Vermont, which has built four charging ports at one location with the federal funds, will halt work on its program, said Patrick Murphy, the policy director at the Vermont Agency of Transportation. In December, the state awarded 11 new projects to add 60 charging ports across the state. Those projects will not proceed with funding from the federal program until the state receives further guidance from the Transportation Department, Mr. Murphy said.</p><p>Some state officials said the federal government’s directive would not substantially change their plans.</p><p>The Maryland Department of Transportation said in a statement that it was “moving forward with its obligated NEVI funding,” adding that it was “awaiting new guidance from US D.O.T. to advance future funding rounds of this congressionally authorized program. Maryland is committed to pressing forward with our strategy to deliver charging infrastructure for clean cars to drivers across the state.”</p><p>Officials at the Tennessee Department of Transportation said the state would continue to finalize contracts with companies during the pause.</p><p>“There are still coordination and planning activities the department will be working on which is part of our state’s larger transportation and energy programs,” Beth Emmons, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. Tennessee has not yet opened a charging station with the federal funding, although it has selected 30 sites.</p><p>If plans for the federally funded charging stations are canceled, it could harm companies in regions and industries that are typically aligned with Mr. Trump. One of the largest recipients of the state E.V. charging money is Love’s, an Oklahoma-based truck stop company with more than 600 gasoline and diesel stations and convenience stores. Several states used their NEVI funding to sign contracts with the company to build E.V. charging stations.</p><p>Kim Okafor, general manager of zero emissions programs for Love’s, said in a statement: “Love’s remains committed to meeting customers’ needs regardless of fuel type and believes a robust electric vehicle charging network is a part of that. Love’s will continue to monitor related executive orders and subsequent changes in law to determine the next steps.”</p><p>Loren McDonald, the chief analyst at Paren, an E.V. analytics company, said the program’s pause would not have a “huge negative impact on the industry,” given that the federal program’s charging ports made up a relatively small share of the total number of charging stations built in the past year.</p><p>He said the program’s pause would be most felt in rural areas where companies have less reason to build chargers without federal subsidies. “The whole role and value of the program is putting those charging stations out in upstate New York or rural Alabama,” Mr. McDonald said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzViNjJhNmRlLTE2ZjEtNWFjNi05NmQ2LTA3OTU4NTI4YWYxNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#attorneys-general-trump-musk-suit" data-source-id="100000009976439"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko"><img alt="Hurubie Meko" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/24/reader-center/author-hurubie-meko/author-hurubie-meko-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/24/reader-center/author-hurubie-meko/author-hurubie-meko-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/24/reader-center/author-hurubie-meko/author-hurubie-meko-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-08T00:03:54.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 7, 2025, 7:03 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko" itemprop="name">Hurubie Meko</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzViNjJhNmRlLTE2ZjEtNWFjNi05NmQ2LTA3OTU4NTI4YWYxNQ=="><a href="#attorneys-general-trump-musk-suit">States accuse Trump of ignoring Constitutional protections by granting DOGE access to sensitive data.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A lawsuit filed by Letitia James, who is the attorney general of New York, and other attorneys general cites social media posts they say show Elon Musk’s intention to stop federal funding.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Letitia James of New York, joined by 18 other Democratic state attorneys general, said in <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-new-york-et-al-v-trump-doge-temporary-restraining-order-memo-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lawsuit Friday</a> that when President Trump gave Elon Musk the run of government computer systems, he had breached protections enshrined in the Constitution and “failed to faithfully execute the laws enacted by Congress.”</p><p>The attorneys general said the president had given “virtually unfettered access” to the federal government’s most sensitive information to young aides who work for Mr. Musk, who runs a program the administration calls the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/doge-government-efficiency-trump-musk.html" title="">Department of Government Efficiency</a>, or DOGE, though it is not an actual department.</p><div><p>While the group was supposedly assigned to cut costs, members are “attempting to access government data to support initiatives to block federal funds from reaching certain disfavored beneficiaries,” according to the suit. Mr. Musk has publicly stated his intention to “recklessly freeze streams of federal funding without warning,” the suit said, pointing to his social media posts in recent days.</p><p>Efforts to reach press officers at the White House were not immediately successful.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s team was given access to the government’s most fundamental computer data, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s payment system, which is used to disburse funds including Social Security benefits, veteran’s benefits and federal employee wages.</p><p>The system — which channels about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-musk-bureau-fiscal-service.html" title="">90 percent of the payments for the U.S. government</a>, which spent about $6.75 trillion last fiscal year — pays funds directly to people in the states, as well as to state governments, the suit says.</p><p>Before President Trump took office last month, access was granted only to a limited number of career civil servants with security clearances, the suit said. But Mr. Musk’s efforts had interrupted federal funding for health clinics, preschools and climate initiatives, according to the filing.</p><p>The money had already been allocated by Congress. The Constitution assigns to lawmakers the job of deciding government spending.</p><p>“President Trump does not have the power to give away Americans’ private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress,” Ms. James said in a statement. “Musk and DOGE have no authority to access Americans’ private information and some of our country’s most sensitive data.”</p><p>The lawsuit was filed in concert with the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.

Yet federal firefighters in recent weeks have had their job offers rescinded or had their start dates pushed back as a handful of agencies worked to clear up confusion about the freeze or secure exemptions from it, said Steve Gutierrez, a spokesman and member of the National Federation of Federal Employees, a union that represents roughly 15,000 federal firefighters. </p><div><p>Federal agencies that hire firefighters include the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service and the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife.<span>  </span></p><p>“My phone has been ringing off the hook,” Mr. Gutierrez said. “These men and women are fighting fire since January only to be slapped in the face. It doesn’t give them confidence that the federal government is going to take care of them.”</p><p>Mr. Gutierrez said that human resources workers at the Forest Service had told firefighter job candidates that their exemptions to the executive order had not yet been approved, so on-boarding would be delayed. The Forest Service employs the majority of federal firefighters, with more than 11,000 on staff as of July 2024.</p><p>In guidance it issued about the executive order, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management said agency heads needed to consult with the office to “determine the scope and extent” of the positions covered by the exemptions, including for public safety. Representatives of the agency, known as O.P.M., could not be immediately reached for comment. </p><p>A spokesperson for the Forest Service said it had “been actively working with O.P.M. on its wildland firefighting positions.” A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior — which oversees the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service — said the agency was implementing Mr. Trump’s order and working with O.P.M., and that the executive order allowed for exemptions for certain positions, including those related to public safety.</p><p>Federal firefighters helped battle blazes that devastated parts of Los Angeles last month during the Palisades and Eaton fires, both of which destroyed thousands of homes, businesses and other structures. Cal Fire, the state’s firefighting agency, called the Forest Service “an important partner” in its efforts to combat ever-worsening wildfires. “It is unknown at this time how this freeze will impact the protection of federal lands in California,” a Cal Fire spokeswoman, Christine McMorrow, said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Gutierrez said firefighters who battled the Palisades and Eaton fires have been affected by the hiring freeze. </p><p>Many of those firefighters who had applied for promotions within their organizations have had their start dates delayed by weeks, he said. He added that federal firefighters served as reinforcements for local and state fire departments during the fires in Los Angeles, and were heavily involved from the beginning because the Eaton fire initially was burning in the foothills of the Angeles National Forest, which is overseen by the Forest Service.</p><p>A Forest Service firefighter based in Los Angeles County said he received an email this week notifying him that his promotion, set to take effect in a few days, would be delayed for at least two weeks because of the federal hiring freeze. </p><p>The firefighter, who asked that his name not be used because he feared losing his job for speaking to a reporter, said he and his colleagues were exhausted from working hundreds of hours of overtime in January alone. He fought the Hurst fire, which broke out in the San Fernando Valley on the same day as the Palisades and Eaton fires. “With the hiring freeze emails, it’s a little unnerving and frustrating,” the firefighter said.</p><p>Separately from the executive order, the Office of Personnel Management instructed agency heads last month to turn over the names of employees still on their probationary periods.<span>  </span>The directive noted that such employees “can be terminated during that period without triggering appeal rights,” and that managers should determine whether they should be retained.</p><p>Mr. Gutierrez said the Forest Service has roughly 2,000 firefighters who are considered on probation and whose jobs could be on the line as a result of that O.P.M. directive. </p><p>“I’m crossing my fingers, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they got screwed over,” he said. “I’m hoping for the best, and I’m preparing for the worst.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvN2NlMjczZDktYTI3MS01OTU0LWI4YTgtYjFiMzEwODc5M2Y0"><div id="7ce273d9-a271-5954-b8a8-b1b3108793f4" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#7ce273d9-a271-5954-b8a8-b1b3108793f4"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-mccreesh"><img alt="Shawn McCreesh" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-07T23:31:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 7, 2025, 6:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-mccreesh" itemprop="name">Shawn McCreesh</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">White House reporter</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>President Trump is revoking former President Joseph R.

</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Richard Beaven for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Seven transgender American citizens sued President Trump and the State Department in federal court on Friday, arguing that a new policy that prevents people from changing gender markers on passports violates their constitutional rights.</p><p>The new passport policy stems from <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> titled “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” which was among the orders Mr. Trump signed on his first day back in office.</p><div><p>The order asserts that the government must end “gender ideology,” which the president described as “an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.”</p><p>After reading President Trump’s order, Zaya Perysian, a transgender woman in California, rushed to apply for a new passport last month, hoping she would receive one that included an “F” for female before the State Department rescinded longstanding policies allowing transgender people to update gender markers on their documents.</p><p>When the passport arrived in the mail, it identified her as a man.</p><p><strong>“</strong>We didn’t expect the federal government to turn on us so quickly and render us void, basically,” said Ms. Perysian, 22, who is a plaintiff. “I am not a man and I will not accept being seen as a man while traveling.”</p><p>Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit in federal court in Massachusetts, where several of the plaintiffs live. It adds to a torrent of legal challenges the Trump administration is facing on a host of initiatives, including efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/federal-judge-trump-birthright-citizenship.html" title="">end birthright citizenship</a> and to drastically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/briefing/delay-trump-resignation-plan-super-bowl-security.html" title="">downsize the federal work force</a>.</p><p>Harrison Fields​, a White House spokesman, said on Friday evening that the administration was prepared to defend the passport policy in court.</p><p>“Radical Leftists can either choose to swim against the tide and reject the overwhelming will of the people, or they can get on board and work with President Trump to advance his wildly popular agenda​,” he said in an email.</p><p>The president’s orders have sought to limit government recognition of an individual’s gender to the sex listed on the original birth certificate, bar transgender soldiers from serving in the military and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">require the Bureau of Prisons</a> to house female transgender prisoners in men’s prisons. Mr. Trump also has called for the halting of any medical treatment to prisoners “for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.”</p><p>The plaintiffs in the passports case argue that Mr. Trump’s policy violates constitutional protections against sex discrimination and infringes on the rights to privacy and freedom of speech.</p><p>The State Department has not issued detailed guidance to the public on its new passport rules. But transgender rights groups said the department in recent weeks did away with an option to select gender-neutral markers on passport applications and began issuing new documents to transgender people with markers that reflect the sex listed on applicants’ original birth certificates.</p><p>Tammy Bruce, a spokeswoman for the State Department, did not respond to an email seeking details of the new policy. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told the <a href="https://www.them.us/story/trump-gender-executive-order-passports-x-marker-effects" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news outlet NOTUS</a> last month that the new policy would not be applied retroactively, but that any new passports would reflect a person’s “God-given sex, which was decided at birth.”</p><p>Sruti Swaminathan, who represents the plaintiffs, said the new policy exposes transgender people to the potential for harassment, suspicion by the authorities about fraudulent documents and even violence when they travel abroad.</p><p>“It’s deterring people from even wanting to travel,” said Mx. Swaminathan, who is nonbinary.</p><p>The change has broad implications beyond overseas travel, said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the executive director of Advocates for Trans Equality. In recent years, he said, passports have become vital documents transgender people use to apply for jobs, housing, loans and government benefits, particularly in states where it’s difficult or impossible to include their gender identity on other forms of identification.</p><p>The newly issued passports effectively out transgender people against their will at a time when animus against them is widespread, he said.</p><p>“It puts a scarlet letter on someone just because of who they are,” Mr. Heng-Lehtinen said.</p><p>Reid Solomon-Lane, 36, a transgender man from Massachusetts who transitioned in 2007, said that obtaining a passport that identified him as male felt empowering and enabled him to work as a flight attendant for nearly a decade without worrying about his safety.</p><p>“At this point in my life, having transitioned so long ago, my trans status is not something I think about every day,” said Mr. Solomon-Lane, who is also a plaintiff in the suit. “To have something that challenges my identity so deeply, and to feel that you are losing your status as an American citizen simply because of being transgender, nonbinary or intersex, is terrifying.”</p><p>Mr. Solomon-Lane, whose current passport will expire during this administration, said he would be too fearful to travel abroad with a document that identifies him as a woman.</p><p>“The thought of being separated from my children for questioning, or anything like that, just is not a risk that I’m willing to take,” said Mr. Solomon-Lane, a flight coordinator for a pilot organization.</p><p>Ms. Perysian, who transitioned in 2020, said she experienced unwelcome and demeaning treatment while traveling domestically using documents that bore her former name and identified her as male. </p><p>“All of that stopped after my license was updated,” said Ms. Perysian, a social media content creator who documented her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zayaperysian?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gender transition on TikTok</a>, where she has nearly five million followers.</p><p>The State Department’s policy on passports and gender has grown more permissive since the agency issued its first directive on the subject in 1971.</p><p>Back then, passports did not feature a sex marker. But the State Department issued guidance authorizing requests for name changes that were “suggestive of a change of sex,” according to a 2017 memo outlining the history of sex identifiers on passports the agency produced as part of a lawsuit.</p><p>The State Department began including sex markers on passports in 1977, a change government officials attributed to the rise of unisex fashion and hair styles.</p><p>“Gender-bending fashion made it harder for border officials to identify someone as male or female,” said Craig Robertson, a professor of communication studies at Northeastern University who wrote a book about <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-passport-in-america-9780199927579?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the history of the American passport</a>. “I sometimes joke David Bowie caused M/F sex markers to be added to the passport.”</p><p>In the early 1990s, the State Department issued new guidance allowing transgender people to obtain passports with an updated sex marker as long as they provided evidence that they had undergone surgery as part of their gender transition.</p><p>In 2010, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rescinded the surgery requirement. The agency adopted a more lenient standard, asking only that transgender passport applicants produce a letter from a doctor asserting they had received “appropriate clinical treatment for gender transition.”</p><p>In 2021, the State Department issued the first passport with a gender-neutral marker — an x — the result of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/us/us-first-passport-gender-x.html" title="">yearslong legal battle</a> by Dana Zzyym, an intersex military veteran.</p><p>The next year, the Biden administration issued a new policy allowing passport applicants to select any gender marker. Gone was the requirement to provide medical records or a rationale.</p><p>Mr. Robertson said little would be lost if passports once again did not include sex markers.</p><p>“The State Department has always struggled to offer a compelling argument why a traveler’s sex and gender is critical to identify them as a citizen, especially in an era of retina scans and biometrics,” he said.</p><p>Seamus Hughes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad4"><div id="ad-4" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid5">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdkNWY5Y2FhLWM3MGUtNTk0MC05YWZmLTJkODkyOTU4MTM3Zg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates#usaid-conspiracy-theories-disinformation" data-source-id="100000009974892"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/steven-lee-myers"><img alt="Steven Lee Myers" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-steven-lee-myers/author-steven-lee-myers-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-steven-lee-myers/author-steven-lee-myers-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-steven-lee-myers/author-steven-lee-myers-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stuart-a-thompson"><img alt="Stuart A.

So did President Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>They amplified the false video as Mr. Musk pressed a crusade to shut down U.S.A.I.D., the agency that has distributed much of the government’s foreign aid since 1961. Working with Mr. Trump’s blessing as the head of a government efficiency campaign, Mr. Musk and others in the administration have taken over the agency’s headquarters, frozen grants and notified employees that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/usaid-job-cuts.html" title="">nearly all</a> of them will be laid off.</p><p>The dismantling of the agency has been accompanied by a torrent of anger online from right-wing influencers and accounts that are promoting false claims and conspiratorial thinking.</p><p>While some politicians and voters have long questioned the value of foreign aid, those attacking the agency have often distorted facts and, wittingly or unwittingly, embraced as true anything that could help justify targeting U.S.A.I.D.</p><p>That includes Mr. Musk himself, who has used the platform he took over in 2022 as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/technology/elon-musk-x-doge.html" title="">a megaphone</a> for the effort to slash the federal bureaucracy. On Sunday Mr. Musk called it “a criminal organization,” without explaining the basis for such an accusation.</p><p>“He’s exploiting ignorance about the way government works, and the lack of oversight over anything he’s doing,” said Mike Rothschild, a disinformation researcher and author of “Jewish Space Lasers,” a book about conspiracy theories. “All of it is incredibly dangerous, and happening right in front of us.”</p><p>The flurry of attacks also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/technology/russia-american-far-right-ukraine.html" title="">underscored once again</a> how much Republican views have increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/business/media/russia-tenet-media-tim-pool.html" title="">converged with propaganda</a> emanating from the Kremlin or with narratives aligned with its international goals, especially on Mr. Musk’s platform. The false video about the celebrities appeared to be the work of an influence campaign that has produced dozens of similar fakes about Russia’s war in Ukraine, according to Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub.</p><p>“Russian anti-Ukraine propaganda has thoroughly infiltrated certain communities on X,” said Darren L. Linvill, a researcher there, who traced the spread of the faked clip from its origin on X through a network of accounts that has distributed Russian fakes before.</p><p>“Given how much time Musk spends on his platform,” Dr. Linvill said, “it was probably inevitable that some fabricated Russian message would resonate with him, and this one seemed almost designed to do just that.”</p><p>Neither Mr. Musk nor Donald Trump Jr. responded immediately to requests for comment.</p><p>X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the spread of misinformation about U.S.A.I.D. on the platform, though it has added a note to posts sharing the video about the actors, noting that it is not real.</p><p>Much of the frenzy online this week has centered on U.S.A.I.D.’s many grants, information about which has been publicly available for years. </p><p>One viral claim, for example, started after an account on X with more than half a million followers suggested that Politico, the Washington news website, had received more than $8 million from U.S.A.I.D.</p><p>That wasn’t true. The website had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/trump-politico-usaid-spending-conspiracy.html" title="">received about $44,000</a> from U.S.A.I.D. for subscriptions to its premium environmental and energy publication over two years, and more than $8 million in subscription revenue from a variety of agencies, including the Department of Energy.</p><p>Even so, the claim shot rapidly across social media, as influencers and politicians with even more followers amplified the idea.</p><p>That set off a round of other misleading claims about U.S.A.I.D. granting money to the BBC and The New York Times. (The agency has instead granted money to an independent charity that shares a name <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mediaaction/press-release/4-feb-25" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with the BBC</a>. The most viral claim about The New York Times was based on an inaccurate search of government records that included grants to unrelated, but similar-sounding groups, like New York University. <a href="https://x.com/NYTimesPR/status/1887604934578712752" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, The Times said that the payments it had received were for subscriptions; <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=1c52a31366e909b012b06d036d389cc1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government data shows</a> it has also received some advertising revenue from the government.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/media/politico-news-subscriptions-white-house.html" title="">canceled</a> its Politico subscriptions.</p><p>For Russia and China, the American conservative uproar over U.S.A.I.D. has been met with startled glee.</p><p>Both nations, echoing Mr. Orban’s complaint, have blamed the agency for supporting subversive programs in their countries.</p><p>Chen Weihua, a prominent bureau chief and columnist for the state news organization China Daily, cited reports about the agency’s funding as vindication for China’s previous claims. He suggested that the BBC’s reporters in China were “all bought” by the Central Intelligence Agency and the British secret service, MI6.</p><p>“If you have questions why BBC reporters in China keep smearing China all these years and talking BS, you might find answers now,” he wrote on X.</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia banned U.S.A.I.D. grants in 2012 and expelled the agency’s workers, accusing the United States of funding opponents of his rule. (Officials from Republican and Democratic administrations have argued that the programs simply promoted civil society in Russia.)</p><p>Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ridiculed a series of grants that have been criticized in the United States, too, and claimed the agency’s underlying purpose was to promote political uprisings, citing protests in Egypt in 2011, Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia last year.</p><p>The false video that went viral this week claiming U.S.A.I.D. funded celebrity travel overseas fit Russia’s recurring narrative that the United States furtively supports Ukraine with resources that American voters would rather spend at home.</p><p>The video appeared to be the work of an influence campaign known to researchers as Operation Overload or Matryoshka, after the Russian nesting dolls, according to Clemson’s Media Forensics Hub. That work is led by a private company with links to the Kremlin.</p><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="disinfo-usaid-video-ajraa" data-id="100000009975727" data-source-id="100000009975727"></section></div><p>The footage showed photographs or clips of a number of well-known actors meeting with Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, while a narrator with a British accent claimed the actors had received large payments from U.S.A.I.D. for the appearance.</p><p>Ms. Jolie, the narrator says, received $20 million; Orlando Bloom, $8 million; Sean Penn, $5 million; and so on. “This was done to increase Zelensky’s popularity among foreign audiences, particularly in the United States,” the narrator claims. “The involvement of celebrities made it easy to coordinate funding programs for Ukraine during the conflict.”</p><p>After the video appeared on the X account, articles about its claims appeared on the sites of at least two Russian news organizations, Tsargrad and Pravda. The video was picked up by a number of accounts that have previously shared Russian disinformation, but soon expanded beyond that to Americans cheering the Trump administration on. By Thursday, users on TikTok and Mr. Trump’s Truth Social platform had shared the video as commenters expressed outrage and called for U.S.A.I.D. to be eliminated.</p><p>There is no evidence of the payments in any of the agency’s programs. A spokesman for E!News also said in a statement that “the video is not authentic and did not originate from E!News.”</p><p>The actor Ben Stiller, said to have been paid $4 million for a visit to Ukraine, took to social media to try to refute the claim. “These are lies coming from Russian media,” he wrote on X. “I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind.”</p><p>More conspiratorially minded supporters of Mr. Musk continue to cheer the billionaire on anyway.</p><p>They include a food service worker and Army National Guard veteran who was <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/article/unmasking-clandestine-figure-behind-viral-ukrainian-biolab-conspiracy-theory" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blamed</a> in 2022 for starting a conspiracy theory about American biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine.

Judge Nichols said the unions had established that the employees affected by the leave and withdrawal orders would suffer “irreparable harm.”</p><p>Judge Nichols said the ordered pause would be brief and allow for further, “expedited” arguments to determine the legality of the administration’s actions, but did not immediately schedule another hearing. He added that he was still considering whether to order the reinstatement of 500 agency employees already on administrative leave.</p><p>His order was the latest action by a court to slow or limit President Trump’s agenda, following rulings that blocked for now Mr. Trump’s moves to freeze federal spending and overturn birthright citizenship. The cases are part of a sprawling legal battle over Mr. Trump’s efforts to expand presidential authority in ways that Democrats and many legal experts call unconstitutional.</p><p>Democrats also fear that Mr. Trump’s sudden moves to gut U.S.A.I.D. — which have instilled a sense of chaos and panic within the agency — may serve as a test case for dramatically cutting or shutting down other federal departments and agencies.</p><p>The unions had asked the court to block Mr. Trump’s dismantlement of the aid agency, calling it “unconstitutional and illegal” and saying it had “generated a global humanitarian crisis” and threatened American strategic interests.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A youth center development funded by U.S.A.I.D. in the West Bank on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaafar Ashtiyeh/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>They also pointed to the toll on the thousands of U.S.A.I.D. workers who have been blindsided by unsubstantiated charges of corruption and even criminality from Mr. Trump and his allies.</p><p>Those accusations have shocked and bewildered workers at an agency that distributes tens of billions of taxpayer dollars per year on humanitarian, medical, development and pro-democracy aid, mainly to countries in desperate need, in what supporters consider some of the U.S. government’s most noble work.</p><p>“They are confused and frightened,” the lawsuit said, adding that some workers had made major life choices “such as geographic location and family planning” on the assumption that the federal government would follow the law.</p><p>“Not a single one of defendants’ actions to dismantle U.S.A.I.D. were taken pursuant to congressional authorization,” the lawsuit said. “And pursuant to federal statute, Congress is the only entity that may lawfully dismantle the agency.”</p><p>The lawsuit was filed Thursday by Democracy Forward and Public Citizen Litigation Group on behalf of the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees. It notes the central role Elon Musk played in the agency’s gutting. Mr. Musk, a Trump ally and donor, recently boasted online of “feeding U.S.A.I.D. into the wood chipper.”</p><p>In a statement, the American Federation of Government Employees said it was “pleased” by the ruling, adding: “We continue to believe this program violates the law, and we will continue to aggressively defend our members’ rights.”</p><p>Current and former U.S.A.I.D. officials expressed elation over the ruling, even if it means the agency’s workers — including those already placed on administrative leave — still face confusion and uncertainty about their fate until Judge Nichols eventually issues a more definitive ruling.</p><p>One former senior official also noted that the pause has no effect on Mr. Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order freezing nearly all U.S. foreign aid spending, which halted most of the agency’s work. (The administration has issued waivers authorizing some specific programs deemed vital or lifesaving.)</p><p>Democrats in Congress were quick to cheer their limited victory, with some focusing on the role of Mr. Musk, an unelected billionaire.</p><p>“I welcome a judicial order to halt the Musk administration’s abuse of U.S.A.I.D.’s work force even temporarily,” Representative Donald S. Beyer Jr., Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement. “The court should uphold the law and put a full and permanent stop to the illegal, unconstitutional, immoral and corrupt destruction of U.S.A.I.D.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Current and former U.S.A.I.D. employees and supporters of foreign aid rallied on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Valerie Plesch for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Over the past several days Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom Mr. Trump named as acting U.S.A.I.D. administrator on Monday, has made the administration’s case that the aid agency’s work needs to be “realigned” with America’s national interest. Mr. Rubio contends that U.S.A.I.D. has resisted direction from the State Department and congressional oversight.</p><p>Mr. Rubio has also asserted, without providing evidence, that some agency workers defied Mr. Trump’s order to freeze all foreign aid. Mr. Rubio has also accused U.S.A.I.D. officials of fighting efforts by Mr. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency to scrutinize their work, forcing the administration to move “faster” against the agency than planned.</p><p>The agency’s defenders say that Trump officials have cherry-picked a small number of expenses and wildly distorted their significance, exploiting deep voter skepticism toward foreign aid — “the least popular thing government spends money on,” as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/rubio-usaid-worker-trust.html" title="">Mr. Rubio put it</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>Not only will the swift agency shutdown have a direct cost in lives, they argue, ending its programs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/opinion/usaid-trump-samantha-power.html" title="">will also benefit</a> American rivals like Russia and China in the global competition for influence. And it will comes as a gift, they say, to authoritarian leaders, such as Hungary’s Viktor Orban, who have long railed at the agency’s spending on civil society and other pro-democracy programs. Some of those authoritarian leaders, including Mr. Orban, are allies of Mr. Trump.</p><p>The plaintiff’s lead lawyer on Friday was Karla Gilbride, who <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/02/ex-eeoc-general-counsel-karla-gilbride-joins-public-citizen-00202129" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was fired last month as the general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>.

On his Truth Social account Friday, he wrote that U.S.A.I.D. should be closed down.</p><p>Before Mr. Trump targeted the agency, which is independent from but guided by the State Department, U.S.A.I.D. employed about 10,000 workers and contractors. By Friday, that number was set to be reduced to only a few hundred people still viewed as essential by the agency’s new leaders in the State Department.</p><p>Asked by Judge Nichols why the Trump administration was moving so fast against U.S.A.I.D. workers, a Justice Department lawyer said the administration was trying to root out “corruption and fraud.” Judge Nichols said the Trump administration had not cited those factors in its order to place workers on leave.</p></div></div></div></div>
