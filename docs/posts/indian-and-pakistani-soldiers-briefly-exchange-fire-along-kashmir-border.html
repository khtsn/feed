Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the U.N. Secretary General, told reporters on Thursday that “we very much appeal to both the government of Pakistan and the government of India to exercise maximum restraint.”</p><p>Zia ur-Rehman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Showkat Nanda<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anupreeta Das covers India and South Asia for The Times.
