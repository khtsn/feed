Peskov, told Russian news agencies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has so far rejected an unconditional 30-day truce that was first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-cease-fire.html" title="">proposed by the United States in early March</a> and immediately accepted by Ukraine.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Putin called this weekend for the resumption of direct negotiations with Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine responded by challenging the Russian leader to meet him in person.</p><p>“I will be in Turkey this Thursday, May 15, and I expect Putin to come to Turkey as well. Personally,” Mr. Zelensky said on Sunday. “And I hope that this time, Putin won’t be looking for excuses as to why he ‘can’t’ make it.”</p><p>Picking up that thread, President Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday, “Don’t underestimate Thursday in Turkey.” His travel schedule has him visiting the Middle East that day, and he suggested he might alter his plans to go to Turkey, depending on how the hoped-for talks go.</p><p>Replying to Mr. Trump’s comments, Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1921955780682502280" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>, “All of us in Ukraine would appreciate it if President Trump could be there with us at this meeting in Turkey. This is the right idea.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Peskov would not comment on Mr. Zelensky’s gambit.</p><p>Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Mr. Zelensky, told the Ukrainian news outlet RBC-Ukraine that Kyiv was accustomed to the Kremlin’s stalling tactics. The offer to meet with the Russian president, he said, was intended to make it clear that the “the ball is in Moscow’s court.”</p><p>“We won’t give Russia reason to accuse us of sabotaging the peace process,” <a href="https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/interview/head-of-ukraine-s-presidential-office-we-1747033076.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Yermak added.</a></p><p>Ukraine, along with its European allies, continued to insist on Monday that the fighting needed to stop before serious negotiations could get underway.</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron of France said that Kyiv had shown itself willing time and again to make concessions in order to begin the hard work of brokering a lasting peace.</p><p>“Either Russia — Mr. Putin — is serious and wants peace, or it’s not serious and we have to impose even more sanctions,” he told reporters.</p><p>Britain’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, told reporters in London that it was time for Russia to stop stalling. “This is the time for Vladimir Putin to get serious about peace in Europe, to get serious about a cease-fire, and to get serious about talks,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>When the leaders of France, Germany, Britain and Poland traveled to Kyiv over the weekend to deliver that same message, they were careful to coordinate their efforts with the White House. They made clear that only agreeing to an unconditional cease-fire would spare Moscow additional sanctions targeting oil exports and banking — and said that the United States would also impose sanctions on Russia if Mr. Putin did not agree to a truce.</p><p>However, after Mr. Putin made a counteroffer of direct talks without mentioning a cease-fire, President Trump urged the Ukrainians to take the meeting.</p><p>“Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” Mr. Trump wrote on Sunday in a statement on social media.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky responded swiftly, seemingly seeking to flip the script on the Russian leader by saying he agreed to negotiations in any format and that he would travel to Turkey to meet with Mr. Putin — personally.</p><p>Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- -->, <!-- -->Christopher F.
