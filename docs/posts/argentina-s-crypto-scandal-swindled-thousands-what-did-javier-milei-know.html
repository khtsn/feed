The largest stakeholders had sold their coins, leaving almost everyone else with a collective $250 million in losses.</p><p>To cryptocurrency veterans, it was a classic “rug-pull.” A celebrity touts a new digital coin, prices soar and then insiders who own most of the coins pull the rug: They sell their stakes for a big profit at the expense of amateur investors who got in later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To Argentina, it was a national scandal. The president, critics said, had just scammed his constituents. The opposition called for impeachment. Argentine citizens filed a dozen criminal complaints. A federal prosecutor opened an investigation, with Mr. Milei as a target.</p><p>Then Mr. Milei left for Washington. At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, he gave a combative speech ahead of President Trump, the other president who promoted a new cryptocurrency this year that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-surges.html" title="">soared</a> and then crashed. That coin, $Trump, generated enormous profits for insiders and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/trump-crypto-memecoin.html" title="">a cumulative $2 billion in losses</a> for more than 800,000 other investors.</p><p>Mr. Trump has claimed ignorance. “I don’t know if it benefited” me, he <a href="https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1881842298750992886" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. “I don’t know much about it.” (The Trump family and its business partners earned nearly $100 million in trading fees alone on the coin.)</p><p>Following the ballooning $Libra scandal in Argentina, Mr. Milei took a similar approach. He did not earn a cent, he said. Instead, he blamed a small start-up in Singapore, KIP Protocol, that few in the crypto industry had heard of.</p><p>“You’ll notice that the company that organized the launch, KIP, explicitly stated that I had nothing to do with it,” he said in a prime time interview last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But Mr. Milei’s story has begun to unravel, showing how crypto and politics have increasingly blended to enrich the powerful and take from most everyone else.</p><p>The origins of the $Libra scandal trace back to a conference in Argentina last year, where an American crypto consultant and an Argentine business partner of Mr. Milei tried to sell access to the president, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The New York Times. It eventually led to meetings in the presidential offices and a planned partnership with Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports.</p><p>Since the crash, evidence has emerged contradicting the president’s claims; critics in Argentina have accused his inner circle of taking bribes; and the American consultant, whom Mr. Milei last month <a href="https://x.com/JMilei/status/1885068460268363889" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">referred to as an adviser</a>, has admitted to amassing $100 million from the scheme.</p><p>“This is an insider’s game,” the American consultant, Hayden Davis, said about crypto coins in a video last week. “This is like an unregulated casino.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Javier Milei of Argentina presented a chain saw, representing cuts to government spending, to Elon Musk at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-6d00254a">‘A little something-something’</h2><p>The crypto world was excited about Mr. Milei.</p><p>A libertarian economist, he had said he wanted to open his financially scarred nation to new currencies. So when it was announced that he would speak at a crypto conference in Buenos Aires in October, industry leaders descended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The conference was organized by Mauricio Novelli, a polished 29-year-old stock trader with yearslong connections to Mr. Milei.</p><p>In 2020, Mr. Milei began teaching at Mr. Novelli’s small investing academy and became the school’s pitchman, posting repeatedly about it online, up until he was president. In 2022, he <a href="https://www.infobae.com/resizer/v2/CQIR63GR7RFOFGXLQ4NE5Y42FE.png?auth=ea337acd205c3ae86634a0edf6719cdd8c9178af7a8ae260b57ac5c67e065b28&amp;smart=true&amp;width=1200&amp;height=533&amp;quality=85" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> about a new crypto project from Mr. Novelli, calling it “an economic model that’s sustainable over time.” Not long after, it collapsed.</p><p>At the conference, Mr. Novelli was charging sponsors $50,000 for a speaking slot and a meet-and-greet with Mr. Milei, according to four attendees who paid the fee.</p><p>Yet those people said the meeting with the president turned out to be a quick group photo. To get more time, two of them said, conference organizers told them it would cost more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“They’d say, ‘Hey, you know, give us a little something-something and we can get you a meeting,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gO29in7ted4?si=4tumc---C-LRAXLX&amp;t=243" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Charles Hoskinson, a cryptocurrency billionaire who founded one of the industry’s largest platforms, Cardano.</p><p>Another attendee said Mr. Novelli offered a meeting with the president if the person signed a $500,000 contract for vague “consulting services,” according to a copy of the document viewed by The Times.</p><p>But Mr. Novelli was not the only one selling access to Mr. Milei.</p><p>Mr. Davis — a 28-year-old with curly blonde hair and garish gold glasses whom Mr. Novelli had met at a crypto event in Denver — was also telling conference attendees that he had “control” over Mr. Milei and could broker deals, according to messages viewed by The Times.</p><p>“Everything from Milei tweeting” to “all the front-facing Milei stuff basically, showing up at things, et cetera — I have control over a lot of those levers,” Mr. Davis said in an audio message to an entrepreneur, obtained by The Times.</p><p>“But,” he added, “there’s a cost.” He insinuated that cost could be in the millions of dollars. “I’m not trying to screw anyone over,” he said, using an expletive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Another entrepreneur said Mr. Davis made an even more brazen offer in writing: He would deliver a meeting with Mr. Milei and a partnership with the Argentine government in exchange for roughly $90 million in cryptocurrencies over 27 months, according to a copy of the proposal viewed by The Times.</p><p>There is no evidence that Mr. Milei was aware of the proposals. Mr. Davis and Mr. Novelli, through spokesmen, declined to comment.</p><p>Three months before the conference, in July, Mr. Novelli and Mr. Davis visited Argentina’s presidential offices, according to government records <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/karina-milei-la-puerta-de-entrada-a-la-casa-rosada-para-los-personajes-detras-de-la-criptomoneda-nid16022025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obtained by the Argentine newspaper La Nación</a>. The records show their host was the president’s sister and chief of staff, Karina Milei.</p><p>In November, they visited the presidential offices again. Afterward, Mr. Novelli and Mr. Davis toasted with champagne at the Four Seasons in Buenos Aires, telling others they had just signed a deal with the president, <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/escandalo-cripto-un-festejo-con-champagne-y-el-supuesto-acuerdo-millonario-del-que-alardeaban-los-nid22022025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to La Nación</a>.</p><p>Then, on Jan. 30, Mr. Milei posted a photo of himself and Mr. Davis, saying the American “was advising me on the impact and applications of” crypto-related technology.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-a4aec2c">‘The KIP Protocol project’</h2><p>Two weeks after that post, a tech entrepreneur in Singapore got an unexpected call from Mr. Novelli.</p><p>The entrepreneur, Julian Peh, founder of a start-up called KIP Protocol, said he had met Mr. Novelli at the October conference. Mr. Peh was one of the few attendees who actually got <a href="https://x.com/julian_kip/status/1847910484789408250" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a sit-down meeting with Mr. Milei</a>. (He said he paid only to sponsor the event.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>But over the next few months, Mr. Peh said, he had no contact with the Argentine president or his office. Then Mr. Novelli called him on Feb. 13 to pitch him on a new project, he said: the launch of a cryptocurrency called $Libra that would ultimately finance small businesses in Argentina.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Novelli described a plan that involved Mr. Davis launching $Libra and Mr. Peh’s company, KIP, distributing funds to businesses, Mr. Peh said.</p><p>It was not his company’s forte — KIP built technology related to artificial intelligence. But Mr. Peh said he agreed anyway.</p><p>A day later, $Libra launched with Mr. Milei’s tweet. The president linked to a <a href="https://www.vivalalibertadproject.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> describing the $Libra project as having “a clear mission: to boost the Argentine economy.” At the bottom was a single disclaimer: “Private Initiative project Developed by KIP Network Inc © 2025.”</p><p>It was before dawn in Singapore. Mr. Peh said he awoke to confused messages from colleagues: What was $Libra?</p><p>With the price crashing after the initial boom, Mr. Peh said Mr. Novelli then directed him to post a message on X supporting the coin. Mr. Novelli provided the exact text in English and Spanish, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Peh said he followed the instructions. “The $LIBRA currency has been a success. We want to thank everyone for their trust and support,” KIP’s account <a href="https://x.com/KIPprotocol/status/1890606008856367576" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a>. “We would like to clarify that this is a private enterprise project, President Milei was not and is not involved in the development of this project, as he has mentioned himself. This is an entirely private enterprise.”</p><p>Two minutes later, Mr. Milei’s account disowned $Libra. “I obviously have no connection whatsoever,” <a href="https://x.com/JMilei/status/1890606683291779195" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his account posted on X</a>. “I was not aware of the project’s details.” He deleted his initial post promoting $Libra.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Casa Rosada, the seat of the Argentine national government and the presidential office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Pabst for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Ten hours after that, Mr. Milei’s office released a statement blaming Mr. Peh and calling $Libra the “KIP Protocol project.” The statement said Mr. Peh had pitched the project to Mr. Milei — and that Mr. Peh had introduced the president to Mr. Davis as a KIP representative.</p><p>“Mr. Davis had no and does not have any connection with the Argentine government and was presented by the KIP Protocol representatives as one of their partners,” the president’s office said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>That appeared to contradict Mr. Davis’s earlier visits to the presidential offices, including before Mr. Milei and Mr. Peh met.</p><p>Mr. Novelli’s company also released a statement blaming Mr. Peh and Mr. Davis for $Libra.
