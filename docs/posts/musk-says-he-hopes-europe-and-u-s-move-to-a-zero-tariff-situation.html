    <h1>Musk Says He Hopes Europe and U.S. Move to a ‘Zero-Tariff Situation’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Musk’s appearance at the League’s meeting, in which he warned of the dangers of censorship and mass immigration, came as he continued to use his influence to bolster far-right forces across Europe.</p><p>Just a day earlier, Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/trump-marine-le-pen-conviction.html" title="">voiced support for Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader</a>, who was convicted this week on embezzlement charges and disqualified from running for public office. Earlier this year, Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/europe/germany-elon-musk-afd.html" title="">publicized the German far-right</a> Alternative for Germany party and weighed into Italy’s immigration debate, prompting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/europe/italy-musk-immigration.html" title="">the country’s president to rebuke him</a>.</p><p>On Saturday, he appeared at the party conference with Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League party. During his brief intervention, Mr. Musk also promoted the activities of his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, supported Mr. Trump’s position on the war in Ukraine and attacked what he called the overregulation of the European Union.</p></div></div>
