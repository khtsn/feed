They came after the tech billionaire turned presidential confidant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/musk-x-european-union-fine.html" title="">had stayed largely silent about Mr. Trump’s tariffs</a>.</p><p>During Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Musk had said there should be “no tariffs at all either way” between the United States and Britain.</p><p>Mr. Musk also said that he hoped that the United States and Europe could “establish a very close partnership<em>,” </em>a statement that contrasted with the<em> </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/world/europe/signal-jeffrey-goldberg-message-hegseth.html" title="">contempt members of Mr. Trump’s administration have shown for Europe</a>, and statements by Mr. Trump himself, who claimed the European Union was created to “screw” America. He added that he wished there were “more freedom of people to move between Europe and North America.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Musk’s appearance at the League’s meeting, in which he warned of the dangers of censorship and mass immigration, came as he continued to use his influence to bolster far-right forces across Europe.</p><p>Just a day earlier, Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/trump-marine-le-pen-conviction.html" title="">voiced support for Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader</a>, who was convicted this week on embezzlement charges and disqualified from running for public office. Earlier this year, Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/europe/germany-elon-musk-afd.html" title="">publicized the German far-right</a> Alternative for Germany party and weighed into Italy’s immigration debate, prompting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/europe/italy-musk-immigration.html" title="">the country’s president to rebuke him</a>.</p><p>On Saturday, he appeared at the party conference with Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League party. During his brief intervention, Mr. Musk also promoted the activities of his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, supported Mr. Trump’s position on the war in Ukraine and attacked what he called the overregulation of the European Union.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
