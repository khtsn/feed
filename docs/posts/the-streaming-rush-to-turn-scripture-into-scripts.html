It is part of the original faith-based programming that streaming services are unveiling to court the viewers who have made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/the-chosen-jesus-streaming-tv.html" title="">“The Chosen,” a prestige drama about the life of Jesus Christ</a>, one of the most successful crowdfunded television or film projects of all time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The sheer size of the audience is enormous,” said Jon Erwin, who pitched “House of David” to Amazon and co-directed several of the first season’s eight episodes. “It is the largest underserved niche audience in the world.”</p><p>Viewership figures from streaming shows are rarely made public, but the team behind “The Chosen” estimates that the show has been watched by more than 280 million unique viewers worldwide, a third of whom it says are not religious. The hit show feels more like a workplace comedy-drama, a version of “The West Wing” set in Galilee, than the direct evangelism of the widely translated “The Jesus Film” (1979) or the storybook sermons of the 1990s animated series “VeggieTales.”</p><p>As “The Chosen” approaches its predestined ending — the biblical story of Jesus’ crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension — streaming services are looking for what could capture its fervent audience next.</p><p>“Chosen” spinoffs about the spread of Christianity and Old Testament figures are already in the works. And other studios are eager to adapt material that has zero copyright protection and billions of adherents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The success of “The Chosen” got Hollywood’s attention.

As the young shepherd begins to bleed into the earth, the camera focuses on a rock within his reach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Martyn Ford, a 6-foot-8 bodybuilder who has played heavies in the “Fast and Furious” series, portrays Goliath in “House of David.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amazon Prime Video</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Michael Iskander, who appeared in the Broadway musical “Kimberly Akimbo,” makes his screen debut as David, the shepherd turned giant slayer turned king.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amazon Prime Video</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Making a TV show based on a religious text is a different task from adapting a book series that is considered sacred only by its most avowed fans. For “House of David,” pastors, historians and biblical and rabbinical scholars were consulted for accuracy.</p><p>But centuries-old sources translated from Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic do not necessarily make for snappy dialogue. Script writers must put words into the mouths of adored figures and create scenes that connect the dots between events in the original text, which some viewers of “The Chosen” may see as blasphemous.</p><p>Casting also means putting modern faces to ancient names. Erwin said that the actors in “House of David” did not have to be religious, but that the production wanted people who were excited about the story.</p><p>David is played by Michael Iskander, a 23-year-old actor who was born in Egypt and is making his screen debut after appearing in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/theater/kimberly-akimbo-review.html" title="">the Broadway musical “Kimberly Akimbo.”</a> Portraying Goliath is Martyn Ford, a 6-foot-8 bodybuilder and actor from England who has played heavies in the “Fast and Furious” series. His nickname is the Nightmare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The show was filmed in hilly patches of Greece and Canada, stand-ins for the Judean Mountains in the West Bank and Israel. That location filming is a sign of renewed investment into religious entertainment. Dallas Jenkins, the creator of “The Chosen,” said that dedicated viewers of biblical stories often forgave scrappier productions with rough edges, but that high production values make it easier to reach broader audiences.</p><p>“There’s no reason that some of the most famous stories in the world can’t be treated as though they are a relevant part of the culture,” Jenkins said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“There’s no reason that some of the most famous stories in the world can’t be treated as though they are a relevant part of the culture,” said Dallas Jenkins, left, the creator of “The Chosen.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brandon Thibodeaux for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A lasting religious revival in Hollywood is unlikely, said Diane Winston, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies religion in media and pointed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/business/media/hollywood-movies-christian-outreach.html" title="">the cyclical nature</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/style/forget-netflix-and-chill-try-pure-flix-and-pray.html" title="">faith in entertainment</a>.</p><p>But the increased outreach, she said, could be a savvy financial move for a secular business looking to spiritual audiences.</p><p>“Streaming services are companies that need to make money, and what drives them is getting more eyeballs,” she said. “If they think faith-based content is going to get that for them, they will invest in it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Erwin said Wonder Project shows would lean on religious themes and morals while trying to serve an audience with diverse tastes. Amazon has also greenlit the studio’s <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/amazon-series-order-its-not-like-that-wonder-project-1236214532/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“It’s Not Like That,”</a> the story of a widower minister and a divorced mother of teenagers who must now navigate lives as single parents in the church.</p><p>Netflix’s deal for faith-based productions is with the mogul Tyler Perry and DeVon Franklin, a Christian motivational speaker who has previously produced secular films and adaptations of popular Christian memoirs. The partnership will begin with <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/r-and-b-tyler-perry-release-date-photos-news" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“R&amp;B,”</a> the modern-day retelling of Ruth and Boaz, which places the story in Tennessee and follows a young woman finding love after escaping the Atlanta music scene and caring for a widowed woman played by Phylicia Rashad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tyler Lepley and Serayah McNeill in the upcoming movie “R&amp;B,” a modern-day version of the Ruth and Boaz story in the Old Testament.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It is no mistake that streaming services are investing in faith-based entertainment after the success of “The Chosen.” The actor who plays Jesus, Jonathan Roumie, has been swarmed by fans who look to him as a stand-in for Christ, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/magazine/jonathan-roumie-interview.html" title="">he recently told The New York Times</a>, including one woman who hoped he could heal her child who uses a wheelchair.</p><p>Season 5 of the show’s planned seven-season arc, which includes the Last Supper and Judas’s betrayal of Jesus, will premiere in theaters this month (with episodes bundled in sets) before streaming exclusively on Prime Video for 90 days. It will then be available on its own app for free, but can no longer be found on Netflix, Hulu and Peacock.</p><p>The next chapters in the “Chosen” universe will include “The Acts of the Apostles” and stand-alone seasons that follow the biblical figures Joseph and Moses. Jenkins is also developing a reality wilderness program, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beargrylls/p/DAS2FqLolki/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Chosen in the Wild With Bear Grylls,”</a> and a children’s animated series, <a href="https://thechosenadventures.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Chosen Adventures.”</a> As part of the deal that gives Prime Video exclusive streaming rights to the main series, the company will get the first look at all projects related to “The Chosen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>This latest push by streaming services has the potential to expand their international audiences, with large Christian communities in countries including Nigeria and the Philippines. Many of the productions will also appeal to an ascendant group in the United States, where President Trump has received substantial support from white evangelical Christians.</p><p>But Erwin said Wonder Project’s productions were not intended to be partisan. He emphasized that an underdog story like David toppling Goliath has value for anyone, regardless of religious or political affiliation.</p><p><strong>“</strong>We might all have different opinions on the size and scope of government or free enterprise,” Erwin said. “But at our core, we really do believe in a lot of the same things.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>28</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>The Comedy, Romance and Drama Plays Out in Tales Millenniums Old<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
