The Justice Department announced that its acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, had traveled to Chicago to oversee the effort to address what he called a “national emergency.”</p><p>The Trump administration has enlisted various law enforcement agencies within the Justice Department — the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. Marshals — to assist operations in Chicago and elsewhere.</p><p>The scale of arrests in Chicago and elsewhere was unclear on Sunday. Local officials in Chicago said they had not been involved in the operations. In some neighborhoods, residents said people were concerned, but also confused about how the reported immigration operations were going to play out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Bove said in a written statement that he had watched agents from the departments of Justice and Homeland Security deploy in lock step “to address a national emergency arising from four years of failed immigration policy.” The Justice Department, he added, was working to “secure the border, stop this invasion and make America safe again.”</p><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that federal agencies have started “enhanced targeted operations” in Chicago “to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.”</p><p>Mr. Bove urged local officials to aid in the effort, and warned there could be consequences for those who do not.</p><p>“We will support everyone at the federal, state and local levels who joins this critical mission to take back our communities,” he said. “We will use all available tools to address obstruction and other unlawful impediments to our efforts to protect the homeland.”</p><p>Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that his state would cooperate with federal authorities in deporting undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes or with pending deportation orders. But he emphasized that state law enforcement would not take part in targeted raids or profile people in the state who might be without documents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Pritzker also said there was no new legal basis for the memo Mr. Bove issued last week indicating the department may investigate and prosecute officials in any jurisdictions that refuse to assist with the deportation crackdown. “They’re just putting that out because they want to threaten everybody,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Pritzker’s office was not given advance notice of the arrests, officials in the governor’s office said. A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department on Sunday reiterated that the department, in accordance with municipal code, does not document immigration status or share information with federal immigration authorities.</p><p>The field offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration assisted in the operation, officials in Chicago confirmed.</p><p>In the Logan Square neighborhood, on the city’s Northwest Side, residents seemed on edge as news reports emerged about the federal operations, Georgia Hampton, a 31-year-old podcast producer, said as she sat inside New Wave Coffee on Sunday. “It feels like everyone is waiting to have some information to spread,” Ms. Hampton said. “Everyone is holding their breath.”</p><p>In Little Village, on the Southwest Side, Juan Sanchez, a 35-year-old electrician who was born in Chicago, said the streets seemed especially quiet. Even residents with legal status, he said, seemed tense.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I can tell you that even for those of us who are citizens or have a green card, there’s fear,” he said. “I’m scared myself — not that I’ll be deported, because I was born here, but I’m scared that I may get scooped up in a mass arrest.”</p><p>Immigration enforcement is an everyday feature of the Homeland Security Department, which oversees agencies including ICE. But the Trump administration has vowed to devote more Justice Department personnel to those efforts as it takes more aggressive action.</p><p>Several immigration advocacy groups in Illinois filed a lawsuit against ICE last week, attempting to prohibit the agency from conducting certain immigration operations in Chicago. The lawsuit asserted that the Trump administration was curtailing free speech through its deportation threats and targeting Chicago because of its “sanctuary city” status.</p><p>Mr. Bove, who was part of Mr. Trump’s defense team in his Manhattan criminal case, is now overseeing much of the department’s day-to-day activity while the Senate works toward a confirmation vote on Pam Bondi, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general. A vote on her nomination is expected this week.</p><p>Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, said on Sunday that the operation in Chicago, which was focused on public safety threats with a criminal background, had resulted in some arrests, though he did not specify how many. They included members of the Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua and individuals with sexual offenses, some of whom he said had been convicted of other crimes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He confirmed that in the course of the operation ICE officers made “collateral arrests,” picking up migrants who were around the target of the operation. Such arrests have been criticized by immigrant rights groups and were not common practice during the Biden administration.</p><p>Mr. Homan said that other operations were taking place across the country and would continue. He said that other agencies were supporting ICE in those efforts and would help increase the number of arrests that the authorities could make.</p><p>“We’re going full-on on this one, and more resources means more arrests,” he said, “which means more criminals off the streets.”</p><p>Robert Chiarito<!-- --> and <!-- -->Minho Kim<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times, writing and reporting stories from around the Midwest.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-bosman">More about Julie Bosman</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz">More about Hamed Aleaziz</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-justice-department">U.S. Justice Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
