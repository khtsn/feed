JB Pritzker of Illinois said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that his state would cooperate with federal authorities in deporting undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes or with pending deportation orders. But he emphasized that state law enforcement would not take part in targeted raids or profile people in the state who might be without documents.</p><p>Mr. Pritzker also said there was no new legal basis for the memo Mr. Bove issued last week indicating the department may investigate and prosecute officials in any jurisdictions that refuse to assist with the deportation crackdown. “They’re just putting that out because they want to threaten everybody,” he said.</p><p>Immigration enforcement is an everyday feature of the Homeland Security Department, which oversees agencies including ICE. But the Trump administration has vowed to devote more Justice Department personnel to those efforts as it takes more aggressive action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Bove, who was part of Mr. Trump’s defense team in his Manhattan criminal case, is now overseeing much of the department’s day-to-day activity while the Senate works toward a confirmation vote on Pam Bondi, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general. A vote on her nomination is expected this week.</p><p>Hamed Aleaziz<!-- --> and <!-- -->Minho Kim<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
