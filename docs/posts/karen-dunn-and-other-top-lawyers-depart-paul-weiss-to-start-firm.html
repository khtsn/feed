She has also been a key partner at Paul Weiss, representing Alphabet, Apple, Uber and Amazon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Rhee served as a top prosecutor in Robert S. Mueller III’s special counsel investigation and oversaw the firm’s Washington office.</p><p>Mr. Isaacson is considered one of the country’s top antitrust lawyers. Ms. Phillips clerked for Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. of the Supreme Court.</p><p>Since the firm’s chairman, Brad Karp, reached the deal with Mr. Trump in March, Paul Weiss has been widely criticized by its own associates, lawyers at other firms and Democrats for capitulating to the president.</p><p>“It has been an honor to work alongside such talented lawyers and to call so many of you our friends,” the lawyers said in the email. “We hope to continue to collaborate with all of you in the years to come and are incredibly grateful for your warm and generous partnership.”</p><p>In a statement on Friday, Mr. Karp said: “We are grateful to Bill, Jeannie, Jessica and Karen for their many contributions to the firm. We wish them well in their future endeavors.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story. Check back for updates.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael S.
