You don’t need — and then the federal government can help them out with the money.”</p><p>Project 2025, the blueprint for a Republican administration that was produced by the Heritage Foundation, calls for flipping the financial burden of response to small disasters so that 75 percent is carried by states and the rest by the federal government. Russell Vought, the chief architect of Project 2025, is Mr. Trump’s pick to run the Office of Management and Budget, where he would significantly shape the federal budget.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Trump’s comments to Fox News left much unanswered, including how much of the cost of disasters he wants to place on states. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fire-affected residents met with FEMA officials in Pasadena, Calif., on Jan. 14.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Frederic J.

But states generally want more help, not less.</p><p>Mr. Trump may force states to take on a greater role.</p><p>“The gentle nudging hasn’t changed the outcome,” said Roy Wright, who held senior roles at FEMA during the Obama and first Trump administrations. “We need a different approach.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That debate comes as extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-key-driver-of-catastrophic-impacts-of-hurricane-helene-that-devastated-both-coastal-and-inland-communities/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">severe</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/climate/california-fires-climate-change-disasters.html" title="">because of climate change</a>, and Mr. Trump has canceled some of the policies designed to make the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/trump-climate-policies.html" title="">more resilient to climate shocks</a>.</p><p>The president has appointed as FEMA’s acting administrator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/fema-announcement-cameron-hamilton.html" title="">Cameron Hamilton</a>, a former Navy SEAL and a former director of emergency medical services at the Department of Homeland Security who has also appeared on Fox News as a military analyst. Unlike previous FEMA administrators, Mr. Hamilton does not appear to have experience managing responses to large-scale hurricanes, wildfires or other disasters.</p><p>The <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-05.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section in Project 2025 on disasters</a> was written by Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the agency responsible for FEMA in Mr. Trump’s first term. In addition to shifting more costs to states for small disasters, the blueprint called for a disaster “deductible” — reducing federal aid to states that fail to protect their communities against disasters. That switch would push states “to take a more proactive role in their own preparedness,” Mr. Cuccinelli wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ken Cuccinelli, the deputy secretary responsible for FEMA in Mr. Trump’s first term, wrote the section of Project 2025 pertaining to disasters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">T.J.

Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator at the time, argued that states needed a financial incentive to impose tougher building codes, curb construction in high-risk areas and otherwise reduce their exposure to hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We’re not seeing a change in behavior,” Mr. Fugate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-12/fema-s-director-wants-capitalism-to-protect-us-from-climate-change" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Bloomberg News</a> in 2016. “There’s got to be a forcing mechanism.”</p><p>But states balked at the idea of higher costs, and the idea fizzled out. After Mr. Trump first took office in 2017, his FEMA administrator, Brock Long, proposed adjusting the amount of federal disaster aid that states could receive, based on whether they had taken steps like strengthening building codes.</p><p>Mr. Long also believes FEMA funding should be replaced with “block grants” — giving states part of the cost of responding and rebuilding after disasters. That would allow governors “greater control over resources and recovery efforts to meet the unique demands of their communities,” Mr. Long said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>The challenge with shifting responsibility to states is that they vary in their ability to respond to disasters, said Pete Gaynor, who succeeded Mr. Long as FEMA administrator in 2019.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Search-and-recovery specialists from FEMA examining wreckage from Hurricane Helene in Swannanoa, N.C., in October.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Loren Elliott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Only a dozen or so states, such as Florida, Texas and California, have the staff and experience needed to manage large disasters, Mr. Gaynor said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Mr. Gaynor said block grants could reduce costs. Instead of paying for disaster recovery that can sometimes last decades, FEMA would estimate the cost of recovery and send the money to the state.</p><p>If a state rebuilt for less, Mr. Gaynor said, it could invest the difference in measures to protect against future disasters, like building sea walls or elevating buildings. If costs exceeded the initial estimate, the state would have to pay the extra cost.</p><p>Block grants have their critics. Deanne Criswell, who ran FEMA during the Biden administration, said she worried that states without the expertise or money to manage the recovery on their own would simply fail to rebuild, leaving them more vulnerable to the next disaster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deanne Criswell, who ran FEMA during the Biden administration, worried that states without the expertise to manage the recovery on their own would simply fail to rebuild.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Criswell agreed with the idea that FEMA does too much. But she said part of the problem was that the agency was taking on work outside of severe weather events — for example, managing the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106676.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal government’s response</a> to the Covid-19 pandemic under the first Trump administration, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/14/us/politics/fema-migrant-children-border-biden.html" title="">helping shelter unaccompanied minors</a> who were intercepted at the southern border.</p><p>Ms. Criswell agreed with the idea that states should do more to prepare for disasters, which could reduce the burden on FEMA. Like her predecessors, she tried to get states to strengthen their building codes to reduce their exposure to disasters. But there has been little movement among states that oppose tougher standards.</p><p>In his Fox News interview, Mr. Trump said that FEMA had failed to do enough to help storm-damaged North Carolina last fall and that it was politically motivated. “The Democrats actually used FEMA not to help North Carolina,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.</p><p>Mr. Criswell said Mr. Trump was wrong. She said that FEMA had deployed personnel to North Carolina before the storm made landfall, with an army of staff members and partners that eventually numbered in the thousands. “I don’t know what he thinks we should have been doing,” Ms. Criswell said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher Flavelle is a Times reporter who writes about how the United States is trying to adapt to the effects of climate change.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christopher-flavelle">More about Christopher Flavelle</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
