    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marc Toberoff, a Los Angeles lawyer who filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/elon-musk-openai-lawsuit.html" title="">lawsuit against OpenAI on behalf of Mr. Musk</a> last year, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Musk was one of OpenAI’s co-founders and one of its initial investors but left after a power struggle. Mr. Musk also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/elon-musk-ai-openai.html" title="">created his own A.I. company</a> to compete head on with Mr. Altman’s company.</p><p>The unsolicited offer landed as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/technology/openai-softbank-investment.html" title="">OpenAI was set to complete</a> a $40 billion fund-raising deal that would nearly double the high-profile company’s valuation from just four months ago.</p><p>The new fund-raising round, led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, values OpenAI at $300 billion, according to three people with knowledge of the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The deal would make OpenAI one of the most valuable private companies in the world, along with the rocket company SpaceX and ByteDance, the maker of TikTok.</p><p>SoftBank would invest up to $40 billion in OpenAI, with other investors providing about a quarter of the total funds, the people said. (The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)</p><p>This is a developing story. Check back for updates.</p></div></div>
