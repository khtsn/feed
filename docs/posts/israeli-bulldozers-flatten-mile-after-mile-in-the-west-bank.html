But many of them who spoke to The Times said the raids that lasted for nine days in Jenin and even longer in Tulkarm went far beyond, noting that the extent of the damaged roads and infrastructure surpassed any previous assaults.</p><p>Several districts were declared “disaster zones,” officials said, because so many buildings were bombed or blown up that they threatened the stability of the broader neighborhood. And incursions that once focused on the towns’ refugee camps spread deeper into other parts of the city.</p><p>Rights groups have also tracked Israeli forces’ intensifying use of airstrikes in the West Bank, which they say violates international law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“They are imposing conditions, materially and psychologically, that make people feel: Gaza is coming to you,” said Shawan Jabarin, the director of Al Haq, a rights group based in the West Bank. “There is a feeling among Palestinians across the West Bank that what is coming is very bad — that it will be a plan to kill and expel us.”</p><h2 id="link-6e77014e">A Morning Raid</h2><p>The most recent operations began early on Aug. 28 when residents of Tulkarm and Jenin awoke to Israeli military bulldozers ripping up streets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/autossell/Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-3/Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-3-square640.png" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/autossell/Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-3/Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-3-square640.png" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/09/12/123462_1_00vid-westbank-raid-tulkarm2_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The digging damaged water and sewage pipes.

Internet, electricity and phone lines were shut down in some areas. Sewage and water lines were also cut, leaving about 80 percent of Jenin without running water, local officials said, including the main hospital.</p><p>“The problem with trying to calculate the costs is that it doesn’t stop,” Mr. Matar said. “It’s an unending string of raids.”</p><h2 id="link-241b9677">Businesses Destroyed</h2><p>Israeli bulldozers have also plowed through commercial areas.
