Videos filmed in Tulkarm and Jenin show bulldozers destroying infrastructure and businesses, and soldiers impeding local emergency responders.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We watched their bulldozers tear up streets, demolish businesses, pharmacies, schools. They even bulldozed the town soccer field, and a tree in the middle of a road,” said Kamal Abu al-Rub, the governor of Jenin, a governorate in the northern West Bank. “What was the point of all of this?”</p><p>In late August, the Israeli military launched one of its most extensive and deadliest raids in the West Bank in years, an escalation from the nearly nightly raids that have become the norm since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks.</p><p>Israel has described the operations as counterterrorism efforts, aimed at rooting out Hamas and other armed militants who have increased their attacks against Israelis. The military said it had found stockpiles of weapons in its recent operations in the northern West Bank, killed 23 militants and arrested 45. One Israeli soldier was killed in Jenin, it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a response to a detailed list of questions from The Times, the Israeli military said that it operated in accordance with international law and “undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure.” It said military engineers had to undertake such operations to demine roads or destroy arms stores hidden on private property.</p><p>But it acknowledged that these “operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures.”</p><p>Residents in Jenin and Tulkarm, towns with a history of rebellion against Israeli occupation, had long been accustomed to targeted, nighttime raids. But many of them who spoke to The Times said the raids that lasted for nine days in Jenin and even longer in Tulkarm went far beyond, noting that the extent of the damaged roads and infrastructure surpassed any previous assaults.</p><p>Several districts were declared “disaster zones,” officials said, because so many buildings were bombed or blown up that they threatened the stability of the broader neighborhood. And incursions that once focused on the towns’ refugee camps spread deeper into other parts of the city.</p><p>Rights groups have also tracked Israeli forces’ intensifying use of airstrikes in the West Bank, which they say violates international law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“They are imposing conditions, materially and psychologically, that make people feel: Gaza is coming to you,” said Shawan Jabarin, the director of Al Haq, a rights group based in the West Bank. “There is a feeling among Palestinians across the West Bank that what is coming is very bad — that it will be a plan to kill and expel us.”</p><h2 id="link-6e77014e">A Morning Raid</h2><p>The most recent operations began early on Aug. 28 when residents of Tulkarm and Jenin awoke to Israeli military bulldozers ripping up streets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/autossell/Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-3/Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-3-square640.png" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/autossell/Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-3/Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-3-square640.png" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/09/12/123462_1_00vid-westbank-raid-tulkarm2_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The digging damaged water and sewage pipes.

Internet, electricity and phone lines were shut down in some areas. Sewage and water lines were also cut, leaving about 80 percent of Jenin without running water, local officials said, including the main hospital.</p><p>“The problem with trying to calculate the costs is that it doesn’t stop,” Mr. Matar said. “It’s an unending string of raids.”</p><h2 id="link-241b9677">Businesses Destroyed</h2><p>Israeli bulldozers have also plowed through commercial areas.

Local business owners who spoke to The Times insisted this area had no links to militants in the city.</p><p>Rami Kmail, 35, is the owner of Rami Center, overlooking the square — the corner building with a red storefront seen in the video below.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-18"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/11/00vid-westbank-raid-32615-cover/00vid-westbank-raid-32615-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/11/00vid-westbank-raid-32615-cover/00vid-westbank-raid-32615-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/09/11/123325_1_00vid-westbank-raid-32615_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Mr. Kmail said his store had been damaged in 10 Israeli raids since Oct. 7.

His teams, he said, failed to respond to 500 to 600 calls per day because they simply could not reach them.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>The sudden rise in calls was not only related to the fighting, medics and municipal officials said, but also to soldiers encircling hospitals. The soldiers, they said, granted entry only to ambulances and not civilian vehicles, so rescuers also had to escort patients needing regular treatments, like dialysis or radiation.</p><p>As a result, the army said it “has been compelled, in some instances, to search ambulances leaving the camps and villages,” but said it tried to minimize the delays.</p><p>Mr. Al-Saadi said some of his teams were forced to wait for long periods of time, putting some patients’ lives at risk.</p><p>With evacuations so difficult, many volunteers said they put together first-aid kits to treat people at their homes.

After Oct. 7, airstrikes by drones, fighter jets and helicopters increased rapidly, killing 41 Palestinians in August alone — more than at any point in close to two decades, according to the U.N.
