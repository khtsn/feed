I’m the co-writer and director of “Saturday Night.” “O.K, let’s see if we can get through one of these skits.” “Sketches! Davey, please.” So what you’re seeing here is a scene from very early in the film. We’re getting introduced to characters left and right. And what we really wanted from the very beginning was a completely immersive experience. You’re watching a movie that is 90 minutes of real time, the 90 minutes leading to the first episode of “Saturday Night Live.” The last line we knew from the beginning it was going to be, “Live from New York, It’s Saturday Night.” “What’s the problem?” “What’s going on, Dan?” “It’s a little lodged.” And we’re seeing the rehearsal of a sketch with John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd and Garrett Morris. And we wanted to give the audience a pure adrenaline roller coaster ride of what it’s like to be there minute to minute as things are happening. And at the beginning, it’s going through the normal steps of trying to figure out blocking and camera work. And by the end, it’s obviously it’s a total catastrophe and it’s one of the many things that hopefully keeps you on the edge of your seat as you’re watching this film. And to do that, we needed to create a living, breathing set where every background actor was brought through a boot camp where they learned how to do their jobs, whether it was cable lighting, sound, and every actor was mic’d every single day. “I’m president of Trojan Horse Home Security.” “I’ve broken into your home tonight to illustrate to you and your family just how ...” [LOUD CRASH] Boom! There goes the light boom. And this refers to something that’s actually happening that Lorne just kept requesting more and more lights. He was being demanding because he had never made television before. No one on that show had done television before. In order to create this kind of chaos on screen, what we found is that we actually had to choreograph this movie like a dance film. I’d have a giant white board like a football coach, and I would have to write plays for all the extras and background actors and crew just so everyone would know where to be. We were given this giant stage to create chaos every single day. And what continues to boggle my mind is that Lorne Michaels does this every Saturday. “I don’t guys. It was kind of exciting. Like, it’s probably good luck.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/saturday-night-anatomy1-hlvq/saturday-night-anatomy1-hlvq-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The director Jason Reitman narrates a sequence from his film about the making of the first episode of “Saturday Night Live.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Hopper Stone/Sony Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/manohla-dargis"><img alt="Manohla Dargis" title="Manohla Dargis" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/15/reader-center/author-manohla-dargis/author-manohla-dargis-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/manohla-dargis" itemprop="name">Manohla Dargis</a></p></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-09-27T08:57:12-04:00"><span>Published <!-- -->Sept. 26, 2024</span><span>Updated <!-- -->Sept. 27, 2024, <span>8:57 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><div><div><div><dl><dt>Saturday Night</dt><dd>Directed by <span>Jason Reitman</span></dd><dd>Biography, Comedy, Drama, History</dd><dd>R</dd><dd>1h 49m</dd></dl></div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Movies about tectonic cultural shifts tend to be too neat and tidy, too frictionless. “Saturday Night,” the director Jason Reitman’s fictional reimagining of the debut of “Saturday Night Live,” is a nice, safe movie about a revolution. Busily plotted and sporadically funny, it is a backstage look at the night a gang of comics whom most of the world had never heard of began taking over TVs across the country. It was a comedy home invasion on a national scale, and it was glorious (when it didn’t suck).</p><p>The movie, written by Reitman and Gil Kenan, has a straightforward conceit. It opens at on Oct. 11, 1975, the night that the show, then called “<a href="https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/first-saturday-night-live-cast-snl-season-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC’s Saturday Night</a>,” is scheduled to debut. (The name was changed in 1977.) In just 90 minutes — ticktock — the show will go live if the performers, writers, crew, network suits and some guy named Lorne can get it together in time. A lot of money, reputations and possibly bright futures are riding on the show, but with its deadline looming, it still seems underbaked and, from some vantage points, overly abstract.</p><p>To convey that premiere and what it portended, Reitman both sticks to the historical record and embellishes it, building momentum by zeroing in on some mini-crisis amid rapid edits, swish pans and rushing bodies. Everything and everyone at 30 Rockefeller Plaza runs too fast or seems immobilized, with characters either in frenetic motion or huddling in pools of flop sweat. As the minutes pass, Reitman periodically cuts to a clock onscreen or someone calls out the time; at one point, a set designer, Leo Yoshimura (Abraham Hsu), slowly begins installing bricks on the stage of Studio 8H, each brick an emblem of the show’s parts sliding into place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/26saturday-night-review-mwlj/26saturday-night-review-mwlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/26saturday-night-review-mwlj/26saturday-night-review-mwlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/26saturday-night-review-mwlj/26saturday-night-review-mwlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A dressing room with brightly lighted mirrors.

But it was unclear what it was, maybe even to those behind the scenes. That much seems obvious when an NBC executive, Dick Ebersol (Cooper Hoffman), asks the show’s creator-producer, Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle), if he knows what it is. The straight-faced Lorne responds with an amusing, self-aggrandizing analogy involving Edison, the lightbulb and electricity. Who are you in this metaphor, the baffled exec asks.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Lorne doesn’t answer, but the movie does by making him its focus. The character is less interesting than his surroundings — he’s more a blurry place holder than a fully realized personality — but whether here or there, Lorne is the center of this storm. He’s the hub, the visionary, the guy who can see past the chaos. Sure, there’s his wife, the writer Rosie Shuster (a tart Rachel Sennott); the host, George Carlin (Matthew Rhys); and a creepy suit, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/arts/television/david-w-tebet-tv-talent-executive-dies-at-91.html" title="">Dave Tebet</a> (Willem Dafoe, in by far the funniest turn). But the star is Lorne because even genius apparently needs a boss.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>So, hi Chevy Chase (Cory Michael Smith), Gilda Radner (Ella Hunt), Jane Curtin (Kim Matula), Laraine Newman (Emily Fairn), Dan Aykroyd (Dylan O’Brien), Garrett Morris (Lamorne Morris, no relation) and John Belushi (Matt Wood). It’s nice to see them, so it’s too bad that only a few of the actors playing the main cast — and only the men — manage to register. That’s the case even when Reitman gestures at the show’s gender problems, as in a peek at a still-funny sketch about female construction workers learning how to harass a guy in short shorts. It’s Dan’s squirmy embarrassment, and how he then wags his rump, that makes it work.</p><p>Reitman does better when he takes on the show’s racial homogeneity, largely by foregrounding Garrett. Long the only Black cast member, the real Garrett Morris held his own despite some <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/snl-veteran-garrett-morris-dave-chappelle-comic-genius-1235036790/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ghastly treatment</a>, which, in the movie, his fictional counterpart expresses by belting, “I’m going to get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see.” Lorne Michaels helped write the song, and Garrett Morris sang it while wearing prison stripes in a later episode for a sketch set in prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The song is queasily, gleefully tasteless, though I still don’t know what we’re being asked to laugh at, and at whose expense? Does it punch up or down, and where does it land? I mean, I laughed when I heard it again in the movie. Among other things, I have been taught by comedy, including by “S.N.L” itself — which rocked my teenage world to the point that I used to hang out at 30 Rock looking for cast members — to laugh at stereotypes, something the show certainly excelled in and the movie smartly evades. It’s another question whether “S.N.L.,” which has a famously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/arts/television/for-snl-cast-being-diverse-may-be-better-than-being-ready.html" title="">terrible record</a> when it comes to diversity, has encouraged viewers to interrogate stereotypes or just enjoy them and move along. It’s only a joke, right?</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Saturday Night” is a movie made by fans, but because Reitman assumes that his viewers are fans, too, and because he’s racing against the clock, he gestures at instead of digging into the show, its humor and history. He nods at the generational shifts in comedy and TV, and tweaks the censors. Yet there’s not enough about how the show’s comedy works, and why one sketch kills and another dies. And there’s no sense of how it works as television. The medium’s intimacy can make you feel as if you’re in on the subversion, though nothing can prepare you for the destabilizing conceptual genius of <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xi2h1n" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andy Kaufman</a> (Nicholas Braun) lip-syncing — to you, in your parents’ home! — the theme of an old cartoon you watched as a child.</p><p>It’s agreeable hanging again with Kaufman, however adulterated this version is. The same holds true of the rest of the crew, even if it’s often like watching children play dress up at a party, one that Reitman keeps flowing, never mind that none of this should flow. It should stagger, erupt and nearly or entirely go off the rails. There’s no danger of that happening in a movie that is finally about a nice boss, a benign paterfamilias, tending to his unruly charges. There’s no doubt of the real Michaels’s importance to “S.N.L.” Yet when I — and I bet you — think about the show that’s helped define pop culture for half a century, it isn’t Michaels who comes to mind. It’s the comedy that happened with and around him, but also, sometimes, despite him.</p><p><strong>Saturday Night</strong></p></div></div></section><div><div></div><div><div><div><p>Manohla Dargis is the chief film critic for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/manohla-dargis">More about Manohla Dargis</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>C</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>5</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>The Evening ‘S.N.L.’ Sprang to Life<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jason-reitman">Jason Reitman</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/george-carlin">George Carlin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/matthew-rhys">Matthew Rhys</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
