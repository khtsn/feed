I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies.”</p><p>LuPone’s offending comments came while discussing an incident last year when she had become concerned about distracting noise levels inside the theater, the Booth, where she was performing. (This is a frequent phenomenon on Broadway, where noise from the streets, and sometimes from adjoining theaters, can be audible.)</p><p>LuPone sought help by asking the Shubert Organization, which operates the theaters where both “Hell’s Kitchen” and “The Roommate” were running, and the issue was apparently addressed when the musical made some adjustments. But after LuPone sent flowers of thanks to the sound crew at “Hell’s Kitchen” and was videotaped describing “Hell’s Kitchen” as “loud” while declining to sign a Playbill from that show, Lewis posted a video calling LuPone’s actions “racially microaggressive.” McDonald posted supportive emojis to the video.</p><p>Asked about the criticism by the New Yorker reporter, LuPone diminished Lewis’s experience (“Don’t call yourself a vet, bitch,” she was quoted as saying) and said McDonald “should know better.” (She also said that she and McDonald, once friends, had had a rift. Asked about that by “CBS Mornings” this week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=29576054272038714&amp;rdid=QLx81veO78isGuVD" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McDonald said</a>, “If there’s a rift between us, I don’t know what it is.”)</p><p>The language about Lewis and McDonald was not the only example of LuPone’s impolitic speech in the interview. She also referred to Glenn Close, who replaced her in “Sunset Boulevard,” with the word “bitch,” and she said that the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, now run by appointees of President Trump, “should get blown up.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>LuPone acknowledged that apologizing was an unusual move for her — she has previously reveled in her devil-may-care candor. “For as long as I have worked in the theater, I have spoken my mind and never apologized,” she wrote in the statement. “That is changing today.”</p><p>Her apology appears to have been prompted in part by <a href="https://assets.playbill.com/editorial/Open-Letter-From-The-Broadway-Theater-Community.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an open letter criticizing her conduct</a> that circulated late this week. “No artist, producer, director or leader — regardless of legacy or celebrity — should be allowed to weaponize their platform to belittle, threaten or devalue others without consequence,” the letter said.</p><p>LuPone did not dispute that.</p><p>“I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday,” she wrote in her statement. “From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theater has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don’t belong anywhere else.</p><p>“I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theater community deserves better.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Paulson is the theater reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
