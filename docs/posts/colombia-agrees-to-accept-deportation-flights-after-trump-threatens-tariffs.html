This set off a furious back and forth with Mr. Trump, who in turn announced a barrage of tariffs and sanctions targeting the country, which has long been a top U.S. ally in Latin America.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113896070273857964" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on social media that the United States would immediately impose a 25 percent tariff on all Colombian imports and would raise them to 50 percent after a week. The Trump administration would also “fully impose” banking and financial sanctions on Colombia, apply a travel ban on Colombian government officials and their associates, and revoke their visas, the president said.</p><p>Mr. Petro hit back on social media. In one post, he announced retaliatory tariffs of <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1883627992150073761" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">25 percent</a> on U.S. imports to Colombia; in another, <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1883624818811236502" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">longer</a> post, he said those tariffs would hit 50 percent. </p><p>Directly addressing Mr. Trump, Mr. Petro also questioned whether the American president was trying to topple him. </p><p>“You don’t like our freedom, fine,” Mr. Petro said. “I do not shake hands with white enslavers.”</p><p>The clash reflected how Mr. Trump was ready to make an example out of Colombia as countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/asia/india-illegal-immigration-trump.html" title="">around the world</a> grapple with how to prepare for the mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants that he has promised.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This looks like a pretty bold and daring escalation on both sides,” said Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, citing Colombia’s economic reliance on the United States, which is still the South American country’s largest trading partner even as China has been making inroads. </p><p>“But equally, for Trump to threaten Colombia this way is pretty bold itself,” Mr. Freeman added. “That’s because Colombia remains historically the longest standing, the deepest, strategic ally in the region.” </p><p>Mr. Trump signed an executive order last week authorizing the U.S. military to assist in securing the border, and the Department of Defense said it would use military aircraft to deport people held in U.S. custody along the southern border.</p><p>Mr. Petro said Sunday <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1883522921710158113" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a series of posts</a> that Colombia would not accept military deportation flights from the United States until the Trump administration provided a process to treat Colombian migrants with “dignity and respect.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Trump administration’s move to use military jets to deport migrants is an expansion on civilian deportation flights, like this one carrying 135 migrants to Guatemala City on Jan. 15.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniele Volpe for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“I cannot make migrants stay in a country that does not want them,” Mr. Petro wrote, “but if that country sends them back, it should be with dignity and respect for them and for our country.” </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He said he was still open to receiving deportees on nonmilitary flights. </p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a <a href="https://www.state.gov/ending-illegal-immigration-in-the-united-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, “Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air.” </p><p>Mr. Petro’s office said the presidential plane would be made available to transport the migrants who had been scheduled to arrive on the military planes. Representatives for Colombia’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The immediate snag with the deportation flights appeared to be that U.S. military planes were transporting the undocumented migrants, a U.S. military official said on Sunday. </p><p>The two U.S. aircraft that were denied the ability to land in Colombia were Air Force C-17 transport planes. One turned around and returned to San Diego; the other flew back to Texas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Petro’s remarks came in response to a post about the treatment of Brazilian deportees. Brazil’s foreign ministry complained of “<a href="https://x.com/ItamaratyGovBr/status/1883313955495645540" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">degrading treatment</a>” of its citizens after 88 migrants arrived in the country handcuffed on Friday and some complained of mistreatment after not being given water or allowed to use the bathroom during the flight.</p><p>Since taking office last Monday, Mr. Trump has issued a series of executive orders and made other moves aimed at laying the groundwork to deport an enormous number of migrants.</p><p>In his missive on social media, Mr. Trump called Mr. Petro, a former left-wing guerrilla, a “socialist” — a term that Mr. Petro has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gustavopetrourrego/posts/943384344271623/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no problem in using</a> to describe himself — and contended that Mr. Petro was “very unpopular.” Mr. Petro’s approval ratings stand at around 34 percent, as he has been weighed down by corruption scandals and a resurgence in fighting among armed groups. </p><p>To justify his measures targeting Colombia, Mr. Trump also claimed that the military deportation flights refused landing by Mr. Petro included a “large number of Illegal Criminals” and that the United States was seeking the “return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.”</p><p>The U.S. tariffs that Mr. Trump had threatened would deal a significant blow to Colombia’s economy. The United States is Colombia’s largest trading partner, with top Colombian exports to the American market including crude oil, coffee and cut flowers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Trade between the two countries totaled $53.5 billion in 2022, with the United States having a trade surplus of $3.9 billion that year. Colombia is the <a href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/opportunities-us-agricultural-products-colombia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largest</a> South American market for U.S. agricultural products, absorbing imports of American pork, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, and dog and cat food. </p><p>Mr. Petro also cast attention on Americans living in Colombia, saying that more than 15,000 Americans were living in the country without authorization, and calling on them to “regularize” their immigration status. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.S. Embassy in Bogotá, Colombia’s capital.
