This is completely unacceptable, and we need immediate change.”</p><p>The Postal Inspection Service <a href="https://x.com/USPIS_CHI/status/1815424093027443004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in July</a> that it was offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in Ms. Redmond’s case.
