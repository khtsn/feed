His wife, Gisèle, became a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/europe/france-rape-trial-gisele-pelicot.html" title="">feminist icon.</a></p><p>But the police and prosecutors suspect that she was not his first victim. “Gisèle Pelicot fears that she herself is only the tip of the iceberg,” one of Ms. Pelicot’s lawyers, Antoine Camus, said in an interview.</p><p>While Mr. Pelicot was in prison awaiting his trial, the police confronted him with DNA evidence linking him to the attempted rape of a 19-year-old woman in the Paris region in 1999. After hours of questioning, he admitted to drugging her, telling the police, “It is me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He is also being investigated for the rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in 1991. Mr. Pelicot has denied any involvement in the murder. But prosecutors indicted him in 2022 for both crimes, which are so similar they have been folded into one case.</p><p>Both victims were young real estate agents in the Paris area. Both were violently assaulted with a blade, tied up, drugged with ether and the lower part of their bodies undressed. In both crime scenes, the victim’s shoes were found neatly placed in the room.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Nanterre courthouse before a hearing last week about Dominique Pelicot and attacks on two women in the 1990s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bertrand Guay/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>No trial date has been set.</p><p>Today Mr. Pelicot, 72, is jailed in southern France, not far from the village where he and his wife, now divorced, had retired. But in 1991, Mr. Pelicot was working as a real estate agent in Paris, and by 1999 had taken a job as a salesman for fire alarms and telephone systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The woman who was murdered, Sophie Narme, had been working for a month in her first job as a real estate agent when she was killed.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sophie Narme.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Hélène Blondel</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>On the evening of Dec. 4, 1991, her employer discovered her lifeless, partly undressed body in a top-floor flat she had shown to a client earlier that morning in the 19th Arrondissement of Paris. The police suspect the client was Mr. Pelicot using a false name.</p><p>They detected a strong smell of ether at the crime scene and during the autopsy. She had been beaten, drugged, stabbed, strangled with her own belt and raped, according to investigation documents read in court during his trial last year.</p><p>Though the crime scene showed traces of violence, with the content of Ms. Narme’s purse scattered across the room, her high-heeled shoes were found carefully placed next to the corpse.</p><p>Eight years later, in 1999, a 19-year-old real estate agent met a prospective client on the top floor of an apartment building in the Paris region for what was supposed to be a routine visit to look at a rental unit. The client, whom the authorities again suspect was Mr. Pelicot using an alias, asked her to take some measurements in the flat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As she turned her back, he pinned her to the ground, forced her onto her belly, bound her wrists with a rope and pressed a fabric covered in ether to her nose, according to the lawyer for the victim, whose name has not been disclosed. She tried holding her breath as he drugged her.</p><p>He took off her high-heeled shoes, carefully placing them on the side. She remembered feeling a box cutter against her skin as her attacker squeezed her throat with his arm. </p><p>“I was still sluggish from the product he’d made me inhale,” the woman told investigators according to case documents read in court. “I couldn’t turn around, I remember feeling like a prisoner in my own body. I didn’t want him to see that I was awake. I felt I couldn’t move.”</p><p>But the effects of the drug soon wore off, and the victim fought off her attacker and then managed to hide in a storeroom for hours, locking it from the inside. Her attacker eventually left.</p><p>The police collected traces of his blood on her shoes and on the carpeted floor. But for years, they made no progress. In 2011, the case was dropped.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It was only reopened when it was linked to Narme murder case.</p><p>For the past 34 years, Florence Rault, the lawyer for Ms. Narme’s mother, had continued to pursue the murder case, regularly asking the court to analyze pieces of evidence or to explore new leads.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Florence Rault at a Paris courthouse in 2023.

But back then, the national system classifying DNA criminal records had just been created and was barely functional.</p><p>Traces of sperm found on the 1991 crime scene were lost by the forensic institute in charge of analyzing the sample.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2010, Mr. Pelicot was arrested for the first time for filming up women’s skirts at a shopping mall in the Paris region, using a camera hidden in a pen. He was let off with a fine of 100 euros, equivalent to roughly $104.</p><p>He was caught doing it again in 2020, in a supermarket in the south of France. But this time, the security guard encouraged the victims to file an official complaint, allowing the police to conduct an investigation.</p><p>That is when the police say they linked Mr. Pelicot’s DNA to the 1999 attempted rape.</p><p>Ms. Rault is now the lawyer for that case, too. Through Ms. Rault, the woman who survived said she had moved on and did not want to talk publicly about the case. She did, however, engage in the legal proceedings and confronted Mr. Pelicot in 2023 as part of the investigation.</p><p>By then, Mr. Pelicot had confessed to many details of the attempted rape. He told the police that he had gone to a real estate agency in Paris because he wanted to get a feel of his old job and to check out prices for rentals.</p><p>He said he acted on “impulse,”<span>  </span>after meeting the agent and setting up an appointment to visit the apartment. He then went back to his car to get the rope and what he described as “a product for cleaning headrests” — a bottle of ether.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I wasn’t planning to have relations with her,” he told the investigating judge, explaining that he drugged her because he wanted to look at her undressed body while avoiding any violence.</p><p>“I tried to forget that for a long time,” he added. “I apologize for lying, it was difficult to admit.”</p><p>His lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, said the statement to the police did not amount to a “formal recognition” of the crime.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dominique Pelicot’s lawyer Béatrice Zavarro outside the courthouse in Nanterre last week.
