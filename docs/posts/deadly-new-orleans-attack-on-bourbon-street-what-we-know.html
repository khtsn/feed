Officials called it an attack, and the F.B.I. said it was investigating it as a potential act of terrorism.</p><p>“This man was trying to run over as many people as he possibly could,” the New Orleans police superintendent, Anne Kirkpatrick, said in a news conference Wednesday morning. “He was hellbent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did.”</p><p>Here’s what we know so far about what happened.</p><h2 id="link-106bb124">How did the attack unfold?</h2><p>The man sped a truck into crowds on Bourbon Street around 3:15 a.m. After crashing, he opened fire, officials said. At least 10 people were killed and about 35 were injured.</p><p>Investigators said they later found what appeared to be improvised explosive devices in the truck and were trying to determine whether the devices were viable. It is not clear if any such devices were detonated.</p><h2 id="link-177f4028">Where exactly did the attack happen?</h2><p>The carnage occurred in the area of the intersection of Canal and Bourbon Streets in the city’s historic French Quarter, one of its most crowded areas and the heart of its tourism industry.</p><p>Officials asked the public on Wednesday morning to stay away from a half-mile stretch of Bourbon Street as the F.B.I. investigated.</p><h2 id="link-4df57769">Who is the suspect?</h2><p>Officials have not yet released the man’s name. He crashed the truck and died after a shootout with police officers, according to the F.B.I.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
