The pageantry on that <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/bishop-eamonn-casey-s-hidden-realites-recalled-at-funeral-mass-1.3013317" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cool March day in 2017</a> included 11 bishops and five dozen priests, all in white, gliding as if airborne up the center aisle of the pew-packed cathedral in Galway.</p><p>Incense and awkwardness commingled. Bishop Casey, who was 89, had once been the charismatic and progressive leader of the Galway Diocese, in western Ireland. But the disclosure in 1992 that he had fathered a child with a distant American cousin, and then refused to have anything to do with the boy, had rocked the Catholic-dominant country and sent him into the wilderness.</p><p>At the funeral, a fellow bishop referred to Bishop Casey’s “profoundly upsetting” actions. Then pallbearers carried his wooden coffin down to the cathedral’s crypt, the apparent end to the story of a charismatic but duplicitous cleric whose transgressions at least had been with a consenting adult.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But the past is patient. In late July, seven years after Bishop Casey’s death, Ireland’s national broadcaster, RTÉ, aired a sobering television documentary asserting that an affair was the least of the man’s covered-up offenses. The disturbing allegations, including that he had begun sexually abusing a niece when she was 5, have now ignited demands that his remains be removed from the crypt — that he effectively be evicted from the sacred ground reserved for the former bishops of Galway.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bishop Casey’s funeral in March 2017.

Mr. Duffy said that the phone lines for his program “just went on fire” after the new allegations, with furious callers demanding the bishop’s disinterment.</p><p>“For the Church to remove him from the crypt would be a major act of atonement,” Mr. Duffy said. “But they don’t want to do it. They literally want it buried.”</p><p>To confront the clerical sins of the past, is it best to disinter the remains of a predatory bishop to reflect atonement by the church? Or, as some have argued, is it better to leave the remains where they are as an eternal reminder of pastoral betrayal?</p><p>Under usual circumstances, the Catholic hierarchy would not deign to engage in calls for exhumation. But with a remarkable <a href="https://www.galwaydiocese.ie/news/2024/07/27/statement-galway-diocesan-office" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">July news release</a> bearing an equally remarkable headline — “Statement from the Galway Diocese on the Interment of the Remains of Bishop Eamonn Casey” — church leaders signaled their recognition of a volatile subject that could not be prayed away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Casey in the early 1980s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Stephen Pearson/Fairfax Media, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Acknowledging that this was “a very sensitive issue that deeply affects people in different ways, and which has different facets,” the diocese said the matter would require “a period of careful consideration and consultation, which has already begun.”</p><p>“Time and space are required to adequately and appropriately bring this undertaking to completion,” the diocesan statement continued. “We will not be making any further public comment until we are in a position to provide an update.”</p><h2 id="link-7756ea91">A Host to the Pope — and a Hypocrite</h2><p>By the time Anne Sheridan, a veteran reporter, began investigating Bishop Casey’s past in 2016, the man was both the personification of clerical deceit and a remnant from another Irish time.</p><p>The ubiquitous clergyman rose to prominence in the 1960s as the outspoken chaplain for the down-and-out Irish emigrant community in London before eventually ascending in 1976 to the prestigious post of bishop of Galway. Widely seen as a refreshing change from the repressive Irish Catholicism of the time, he spoke out for social justice, bantered on late-night television shows and raced expensive sedans along narrow back roads. When Pope John Paul II visited Ireland in 1979, <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/news/irishvoice/pope-eamon-casey-michael-cleary" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bishop Casey was a de facto host</a> — but also a hypocrite.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the early 1970s, while serving as bishop of Kerry, he had an affair with his distant cousin Annie Murphy, then 25, who had come to Ireland from the United States to recover from a miscarriage and divorce. When she later gave birth to their son, Bishop Casey tried to pressure her into giving the infant up for adoption and then ignored the boy’s existence, all while publicly decrying the plight of unmarried mothers.</p><p>Ms. Murphy ended the relationship and returned with the boy, Peter, to the United States. Over the years, the bishop sent monthly support payments. But when he refused her demand to be more involved in their son’s life, Ms. Murphy filed a paternity suit in New York, after which Bishop Casey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/09/world/mother-of-bishop-s-son-tells-of-irish-love-affair.html" title="">sent her $100,000 in diocesan funds for Peter’s education</a>.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the early 1970s, while serving in the Kerry Diocese, Bishop Casey had an affair with Annie Murphy, his distant cousin, and tried to persuade her to give up their baby, Peter.

Bishop Casey resigned, left Ireland and before long was serving penance as a missionary in Ecuador.</p><p>After a spell in England, he returned in 2006 to a transformed Ireland, where seemingly endless scandal — including revelations of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/world/europe/ireland-shaken-by-sex-abuse-report.html" title="">pedophile priests</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html" title="">cruel institutions for unwed mothers</a> — had weakened the influence of the Catholic hierarchy on everyday Irish life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Bishop Casey’s known offenses seemed venial by comparison; he had repeatedly apologized, and had reconnected with his son. When he retired to the rural Galway community of Shanaglish, the locals celebrated his arrival with fireworks.</p><p>The aged bishop was living with Alzheimer’s disease in a nursing home in 2016 when Ms. Sheridan, the reporter, received an anonymous letter concerning the man, someone she had heard about all her life. Like Bishop Casey, she had grown up in Kerry, where everyone knew about the larger-than-life cleric and his reckless driving, memorialized in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGa5uB7bonM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cheeky song by the folk singer Christy Moore</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anne Sheridan, a veteran reporter, began investigating claims against Bishop Casey in 2016 and revealed that five women had independently complained to the church authorities of having been sexually abused by the clergyman.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.rte.ie/player/movie/bishop-caseys-buried-secrets/536413224317" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documentary that aired in July, “Bishop Casey’s Buried Secrets,”</a> which relied in part on Ms. Sheridan’s reporting for the Limerick Leader and the Irish Mail on Sunday newspapers, revealed that five women had independently complained to the church authorities of having been sexually abused as children by Bishop Casey. The complaints, dating back decades, involved all three Irish dioceses in which he served.</p><p>Ms. Sheridan and two RTÉ producers, Roger Childs and Birthe Tonseth, reported that the Galway Diocese had insisted for years that it knew of only one allegation, which was filed with the police but did not result in prosecution. Finally, though, the diocese acknowledged having five child-abuse allegations in its files, in addition to two complaints from women who said that the bishop’s abuse of their trust had involved sexual acts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Sheridan discovered that one child-abuse complaint, filed in 2001, had resulted in a confidential settlement, while another was settled by the Limerick Diocese with a payment of more than $100,000 after Bishop Casey’s death.</p><p>The documentary centered on Patricia Donovan, a niece of the bishop, who said that he had sexually abused her for at least a decade, beginning when she was 5, in the 1960s. She portrayed him as a fearless pedophile who “thought he could do what he liked, when he liked, how he liked.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The documentary that aired in July, “Bishop Casey’s Buried Secrets,” relied in part on Ms. Sheridan’s reporting for the Limerick Leader and the Irish Mail on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Donovan filed complaints with the police and church officials in England — where she lived — in late 2005, and then shortly afterward with authorities in Ireland. Her allegations, described as credible by a leading child-safeguarding consultant who appears in the documentary, did not result in criminal charges. Still, they prompted church officials in England to push for Bishop Casey to leave their country.</p><p>He returned to Ireland to retire, but by then the Vatican had quietly restricted his ministry, prohibiting him from conducting priestly duties in public. He did anyway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In a written statement to Ms. Sheridan, a spokesman for the Galway Diocese said: “This prohibition was a source of upset to Bishop Casey and on a few publicly documented occasions, it is known he violated this prohibition.”</p><h2 id="link-39dc214c">Pastoral Betrayal</h2><p>The latest revelations have sparked rage. Catholic Church coverups of pedophile priests had become all too familiar in Ireland, but this case involved a notorious bishop who in later years had been treated almost like a lovable rogue.</p><p>“Betrayal is the word now used most frequently when Bishop Casey’s legacy is raised,” Ms. Sheridan said.</p><p>Compounding that sense of betrayal are memories of the send-off given to Bishop Casey by the church hierarchy: a packed cathedral that included Ireland’s president, Michael D. Higgins, scores of clerics and a solemn recessional leading to the exclusive crypt below.</p><p>Only those steeped in Catholic protocol would have detected the modifications to ritual designed to play down his elevated status as a bishop, or noticed the absence of any archbishop or Vatican representative. The service was both loud and quiet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Now, people are revisiting that ceremony and demanding that Bishop Casey’s remains be removed from the cathedral’s resting place of honor. Even the country’s prime minister, Simon Harris, has chimed in. He welcomed plans by the national police to review its Casey case file, and urged the Galway Diocese “to ensure their further consideration and consultation is victim focused.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Among those championing the disinterment of Eamonn Casey’s remains is Joe Duffy, who hosts a popular nationwide call-in radio show.
