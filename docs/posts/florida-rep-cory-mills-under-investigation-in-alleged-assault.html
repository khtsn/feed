data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., said on Friday that it was investigating U.S. Representative Cory Mills, a Republican representing a district northeast of Orlando, in connection with a report of an assault on a woman this week.</p><p>Tom Lynch, a spokesman for the police, confirmed the investigation into Mr. Mills, who is not named in a police report on the matter.</p><p>The police are also investigating their own handling of the matter, which has not resulted in an arrest, Mr. Lynch said.</p><p>The congressman’s office said in a statement on Friday that law enforcement was “asked to resolve a private matter” at his residence, but that Mr. Mills “vehemently denies any wrongdoing whatsoever, and is confident any investigation will clear this matter quickly.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The woman, who is not the congressman’s wife, said in a statement that “several factors” had influenced her decision to “involve the authorities.”</p><p>She said she had just returned from a 14-hour flight “severely jet-lagged and sleep-deprived.”</p><p>Additionally, she said she had been drinking during her vacation and that she had a drink in front of her when the police arrived, “which contributed to my emotional state.”</p><p>“Upon their arrival, they noticed some bruising and marks on my arms, which I explained were the result of medical conditions like eczema and activities from my recent trip to Dubai,” she said. “While the personal matter in question was emotionally charged, there was no physical altercation.”</p><p>The woman, 27, added that this was “a deeply personal matter that is being unfairly exploited for political purposes or other motives.”</p><p>The police report offers scant details about what happened at a penthouse residence in a luxury apartment building on Feb. 19, stating simply that the alleged assault is being investigated and that hands/feet were the “personal weapons” involved in the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The woman did not respond to questions regarding the nature of her relationship with the 44-year-old congressman.</p><p>Mr. Lynch, the police spokesman, said that internal affairs was looking into the initial handling of the case, “from the very moment officers arrived on the scene, and looking into all the decision making and the classification of the offenses that were determined throughout the last 48 hours.”</p><p>Though he said that he could not confirm whether there had been revisions to a police report on the episode, Mr. Lynch said that such changes would not be “a unique thing to this incident.”</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/iQ3QC8uhH3U?si=0loNdBnJx9mXeO7j&amp;t=932" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">During a news conference</a> on Friday, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the internal investigation was about “making sure that all of our members did what they were supposed to do, according to M.P.D. policy.”</p><p>Mr. Mills <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-florida-us-house-7.html" title="">won re-election</a> in November. He previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/30/us/politics/florida-republican-sends-grenades.html" title="">made headlines</a> in 2023 when he handed out an unusual welcome gift to colleagues in the House of Representatives: inert grenades with a letter inviting them to “come together.”</p><p>Luke Broadwater contributed reporting, and Kirsten Noyes contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
