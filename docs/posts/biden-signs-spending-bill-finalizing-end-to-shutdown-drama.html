    <h1>Biden Signs Spending Bill, Finalizing End to Shutdown Drama</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Biden on Saturday signed the spending package that allowed federal funds to keep flowing until mid-March, formally ending the week’s unexpected drama over the issue a few hours after the deadline for a shutdown had technically passed.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s signature came after the Senate passed the legislation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/us/politics/congress-shutdown-budget-deadline.html" title="">early on Saturday</a>, after a bipartisan vote in the House on Friday evening. The bill, which maintains the current level of government funding and also provides $100 billion in disaster relief for regions still recovering from storms and $10 billion in direct aid for farmers, punted the spending deadline to the early months of the Trump administration, when Republicans will control both chambers of Congress.</p><p>“This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,” Mr. Biden said in a statement released after he signed the bill. “But it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the government can continue to operate at full capacity.”</p><p>Mr. Biden had been all but absent from the chaotic spending negotiations that gripped Washington for several days as the shutdown deadline loomed. (In a statement earlier in the week, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, accused President-elect Donald J. Trump of ordering a shutdown and said: “A deal is a deal. Republicans should keep their word.”)</p></div></div>
