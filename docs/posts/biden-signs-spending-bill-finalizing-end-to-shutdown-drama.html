The bill, which maintains the current level of government funding and also provides $100 billion in disaster relief for regions still recovering from storms and $10 billion in direct aid for farmers, punted the spending deadline to the early months of the Trump administration, when Republicans will control both chambers of Congress.</p><p>“This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,” Mr. Biden said in a statement released after he signed the bill. “But it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the government can continue to operate at full capacity.”</p><p>Mr. Biden had been all but absent from the chaotic spending negotiations that gripped Washington for several days as the shutdown deadline loomed. (In a statement earlier in the week, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, accused President-elect Donald J. Trump of ordering a shutdown and said: “A deal is a deal. Republicans should keep their word.”)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Two earlier versions of the bill that Mr. Biden signed had failed to make it to his desk. The first, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/spending-bill-explainer.html" title="">sprawling package</a> attacked relentlessly on Wednesday by Elon Musk on social media and eventually by Mr. Trump as well, didn’t even make it to the House floor for a vote. A more stripped-down version carrying a suspension of the debt limit, which Mr. Trump had demanded, failed to pass the House amid a rebellion by three dozen fiscally conservative Republicans, who joined nearly all Democrats in voting it down on Thursday night.</p><p>The spending fight demonstrated the limited grip that Mr. Trump has on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/us/politics/gop-spending-hawks-trump-debt.html" title="">right-wing faction of the Republican Party that is adamantly opposed to taking on more debt</a>.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
