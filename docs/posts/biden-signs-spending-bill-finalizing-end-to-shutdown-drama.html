    <h1>Biden Signs Spending Bill, Finalizing End to Shutdown Drama</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Biden on Saturday signed the spending package that allowed federal funds to keep flowing until mid-March, formally ending the week’s unexpected drama over the issue a few hours after the deadline for a shutdown had technically passed.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s signature comes after the Senate passed the spending bill early on Saturday, which followed a bipartisan vote in the House on Friday evening. The bill, which maintains the current level of government funding and also provides $100 billion in disaster relief for regions still recovering from storms and $10 billion in direct aid for farmers, punted the spending deadline to the early months of the Trump administration, when Republicans will control both chambers of Congress.</p></div></div>
