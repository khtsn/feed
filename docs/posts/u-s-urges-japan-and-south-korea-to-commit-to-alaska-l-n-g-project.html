Its feasibility hinges on securing backing from the region, home to some of the world’s largest purchasers of liquefied natural gas.</p><p>A group created by Mr. Trump that is advising him on domestic energy production, the National Energy Dominance Council, is seeking to convene officials from the trade ministries of both Japan and South Korea for a summit in Alaska on June 2, according to three people with knowledge of the confidential outreach who requested anonymity.</p><p>The project’s proponents want to be able to announce at the summit that they have received signed letters of intent from Japan and South Korea to invest in Alaska L.N.G. or purchase its gas, the people said. Taiwan formally signed a similar letter of intent to purchase gas from Alaska L.N.G. last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The White House, as well as the Japanese and South Korean trade ministries, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Alaska L.N.G., first proposed more than a decade ago, had been considered by many in the energy industry to be a long shot. But it occupies a prominent spot in Mr. Trump’s efforts to reshape the U.S. energy landscape and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/climate/interior-department-gas-and-mining-projects.html" title="">restore momentum for fossil fuels</a>.</p><p>The plan is to construct an 800-mile pipeline from fields north of the Arctic Circle to southern Alaska. From there, the gas would be cooled into liquid form and shipped on tankers to Asia.</p><p>For Asian countries, shipping L.N.G. from Alaska would be cheaper and quicker than importing it from many of their traditional sources, including Australia, the Middle East and the Gulf Coast of the United States.</p><p>But major Asian buyers of the fuel, including Japan, have long been cautious about the Alaska L.N.G. project because of its substantial costs, and doubts that it would actually be able to get off the ground.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order aimed at “unleashing” Alaska’s energy potential, including the pipeline proposal.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/multimedia/24biz-alaska-lng/24biz-alaska-lng-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/multimedia/24biz-alaska-lng/24biz-alaska-lng-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/multimedia/24biz-alaska-lng/24biz-alaska-lng-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An oil drilling site with oil rigs in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/multimedia/24biz-alaska-lng/24biz-alaska-lng-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/multimedia/24biz-alaska-lng/24biz-alaska-lng-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/multimedia/24biz-alaska-lng/24biz-alaska-lng-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/multimedia/24biz-alaska-lng/24biz-alaska-lng-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a1565386-664b-5392-bea3-c3dbe0b64c7c" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An oil well on the North Slope of Alaska.

South Korea has made similar promises and is set to begin negotiations in Washington on Thursday.</p><p>Last month, Taiwan’s state oil and gas company, CPC, signed a letter of intent to buy six million metric tons of gas from Alaska L.N.G. That would represent almost a third of the total amount of liquefied natural gas Taiwan imported last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump has said he believes that countries in Asia would sign on to support the Alaska project. During his address to Congress in March, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/trump-lng-japan-south-korea.html" title="">said</a> Japan and South Korea wanted to invest “trillions of dollars each” in the project, a statement that took officials in Tokyo and Seoul by surprise. He did not clarify how the project, which isn’t expected to begin shipping liquefied gas until the early 2030s, would receive trillions in investment.</p><p>In Japan, and most likely elsewhere, the challenge will be securing private-sector buyers willing to align with government plans and enter into long-term agreements to purchase gas from Alaska L.N.G. In Japan, U.S. officials see three energy companies — Jera, Tokyo Gas and Inpex — as potential customers, two of the people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Many remain wary of the economics of such a deal. Letters of intent to participate in the project are likely to include room to withdraw. Alaska L.N.G. says the price of its gas would be competitive when it begins operations.</p><p>Kiuko Notoya<!-- --> and <!-- -->Jin Yu Young<!-- --> contributed reporting</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Challenging Migrants’ Due Process Rights: </strong>White House officials are eschewing normal legal processes as they ramp up deportations, saying there is no time to afford unauthorized immigrants any rights — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-immigrants-trials-deportation.html">and that they don’t deserve them anyway</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Approval Rating Falling Steadily:</strong> Trump’s approval rating has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-approval-rating.html">sunk to about 45 percent</a>, down from 52 percent one week after he took office.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk Backs Away: </strong>As Elon Musk moves to spend less time in Washington, it is unclear whether his plan to overhaul the federal bureaucracy will have lasting power. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-trump.html">The endeavor has still not come close to cutting the $1 trillion</a> he vowed to find in waste, fraud and abuse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oil, Gas and Mining Projects: </strong>The Trump administration plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/climate/interior-department-gas-and-mining-projects.html">dramatically reduce environmental reviews</a> before permitting drilling and mining projects on public lands and in federal waters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Private Dinner for Memecoin Investors:</strong> A website promoting $TRUMP, the president’s so-called memecoin, announced that the largest buyers would be invited to meet President Trump.
