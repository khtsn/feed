The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/science/nuclear-reactor-waste-finland.html" title="">reported on their plans</a> in 2017.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Posiva has been working on the site, located on the country’s western coast, since 2004, and it hopes to begin permanent disposal in less than a year.</p><p>“We have a solution,” said Pasi Tuohimaa, Posiva’s communications manager. “Final disposal of the spent fuel, it has been the missing part of sustainable use of nuclear energy.”</p><p>Earlier this month, the United States Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-hears-dispute-nuclear-waste-storage-texas-rcna194740" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heard arguments</a> in a lawsuit over the federal government’s decision to approve a temporary storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. The lawsuit underscored a touchy subject — plans to store nuclear waste deep under Yucca Mountain in Nevada, the only permanent storage site in the United States <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-603#:~:text=The%20NWPA%2C%20as%20amended%2C%20requires,significant%20financial%20consequences%20for%20taxpayers." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allowed by federal law</a>, have been stalled for years.</p><p>The World Nuclear Association estimates the amount of spent nuclear fuel in the U.S. at the moment would fill up only half of a football field. But, as demand for electricity has risen, the nuclear industry is going through something of a renaissance, with companies investing billions and planning to reopen shuttered plants in the U.S.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><h3 id="link-50f4eb69"><span><strong>How Posiva’s storage plan works</strong></span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A copper capsule for spent nuclear fuel during a test in the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository in Eurajoki, Finland, in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lehtikuva/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The barriers to permanently storing nuclear waste aren’t as much technical as about planning and politics. Permanent nuclear waste storage facilities can take decades to study and build.</p><p>At its disposal site, Posiva has drilled an array of tunnels spanning a collective 10 kilometers, Tuohimaa said. The company’s plan is to insert the used fuel pellets into rods that are contained in iron and copper canisters. The containers are then stored hundreds of meters underground and surrounded by compressed bentonite, a type of clay that swells when it comes into contact with moisture and essentially tightens the area around the containers. The tunnels are then backfilled.</p><p>“The main thing is to isolate it safely,” Tuohimaa said.</p><p>Right now, spent nuclear fuel in the U.S. can be temporarily stored in special pools or in dry casks at nuclear-reactor sites, <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>. It can also be stored at independent storage sites <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/licensing.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if authorized by the commission</a>, which is one of the issues at the heart of the case that has made its way to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Storing it temporarily, however, has a hefty price tag. The federal government currently pays hundreds of millions of dollars per year for the spent fuel’s temporary storage.</p><h3 id="link-51de56ad"><span><strong>Where permanent storage goes from here</strong></span></h3><p>In Finland, which gets more than 40 percent of its power from nuclear energy, Posiva is currently doing a trial run using fill-in elements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Other countries are following in Finland’s footsteps.
