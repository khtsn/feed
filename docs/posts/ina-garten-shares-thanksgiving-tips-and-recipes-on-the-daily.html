It’s 6:41 a.m. And we are on the Long Island Expressway. For most of you, Thanksgiving is going to mean either hosting or being hosted for a very special meal. So yeah, we’re going to be sitting in traffic for quite some time. And when we thought about that, our minds immediately went to the great host of our times, Ina Garten, a.k.a. the Barefoot Contessa. And she invited us into her absolutely idyllic home. Let us into her barn, which is her test kitchen. “Thank you so much. That’s really sweet.” “We don’t have to drink it, but we could.” “We could.” And there she taught us how to make the perfect glazed ham that is completely ready by the time you walk in her door. “Ham, meet ham.” And how to make the perfect seasonal cocktail. In this case, it was a cranberry martini. “It’s really nice.” “Isn’t it good.” And for your benefit, we recorded the entire thing. And it is today’s “Daily.” Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/28/podcasts/the-daily/Ina_Garten_THM4/Ina_Garten_THM4-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Michael Barbaro, host of “The Daily,” visited the legendary cook at her home in East Hampton, N.Y., for a Thanksgiving meal.</span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2024-11-28T05:55:04-05:00">Nov. 28, 2024, <span>5:55 a.m. ET</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><h3 id="link-61cd52a9"><span><strong><em>Listen to and follow ‘The Daily’</em></strong></span></h3><p>Leading up to Thanksgiving, we took a trip to the home of Ina Garten, the iconic cookbook author and TV star. For one glorious afternoon, she gave us a master class on the art of hosting. She answered our questions big and small — seating arrangements, whether to have bread at the table, what to do with that difficult relative, how to zest correctly. Plus, she walked us through two of her go-to holiday recipes, which turned out to be simpler than we expected. Listen to the episode below, and explore some of her recipes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-1"><figure><figcaption><div><h3>Listen to ‘The Daily’: Thanksgiving With Ina Garten</h3><p><span>The Barefoot Contessa shares her expert hosting advice. “The simpler the meal is, the more fun everybody has,” she said.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-2"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="28DAILY-garten" data-id="100000009847035" data-source-id="100000009847035"><div slug="28DAILY-garten" data-sourceid="100000009847035" id="embed-id-100000009847035">
