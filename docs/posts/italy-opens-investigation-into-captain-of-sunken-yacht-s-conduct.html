    <h1>Italy Opens Investigation Into Captain of Sunken Yacht’s Conduct</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The 183-foot vessel, the Bayesian, sank as Mr. Lynch and his friends were celebrating his acquittal from a bruising fraud case. The boat sank early last Monday morning about half a mile off the port of Porticello, a small Italian fishing town, after it was caught in a strong, sudden storm.</p><p>Many questions remain as to why such a massive, luxurious and expensive boat could sink so quickly as another boat nearby weathered the storm largely unscathed.</p><p>The chief executive of the company that acquired the yacht’s manufacturer has been adamant that the boat was virtually unsinkable if all the correct procedures to operate it were followed. But many experts in the maritime field have pushed back, warning that too little is known about the accident and the weather conditions at the time to come to any conclusions.</p><p>Mr. Mordiglia declined to comment further on the case. Several crew members approached by The New York Times declined to comment.</p><p>For a week, the crew has been staying at a sprawling resort by Porticello, one of the few large hotels in the area. The resort has become an unlikely shelter for the survivors of such a dramatic accident, with loud group dances, speakers blaring Italian summer hits and water aerobics directives for the families vacationing.</p></div></div>
