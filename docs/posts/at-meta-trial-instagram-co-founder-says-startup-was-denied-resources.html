Last week, current and former Meta executives testified that the social media giant, formerly known as Facebook, used its deep pockets to invest in Instagram after its purchase.</p><p>In testimony at the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, Mr. Systrom painted a different picture, saying he left Meta because Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, wasn’t investing enough. At that time, Instagram had grown to 1 billion users, about 40 percent of Facebook’s size, yet the photo-sharing app had only 1,000 employees compared to 35,000 employees at Facebook, he said.</p><p>“We were by far the fastest growing team. We produced the most revenue and relative to what we should have been at the time, I felt like we should have been much larger,” said Mr. Systrom, who is expected to testify for six hours.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Systrom said he found the decisions baffling. When asked by an F.T.C. lawyer why Mr. Zuckerberg might have decided to give Instagram fewer resources, Mr. Systrom said it was a consistent pattern during his tenure at Meta.</p><p>“Mark was not investing in Instagram because he believed we were a threat to their growth,” he said, referring to Mr. Zuckerberg’s prioritization of Facebook.</p><p>The case, Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms, entered its second week on Monday and hinges on Meta’s purchases of Instagram, more than a decade ago for $1 billion, and WhatsApp, in 2014 for $19 billion. The government has argued that the acquisitions harmed competition by removing promising startups from the market that could have challenged Meta’s dominance.</p><p>The company and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/meta-antitrust-trial-mark-zuckerberg.html" title="">Mr. Zuckerberg</a> were paranoid about the rise of smaller rivals, which offered superior products to those built by Meta, the government has argued. By buying both companies, Meta hurt competition and consumers who were deprived of more choices, the government has said.</p><p>The F.T.C. seeks to break up the social media giant, threatening Meta’s $165 billion advertising business, alongside 3.5 billion users who get and share information from the company online.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, the first witness called by the government, said last week that Meta provided key technological help to Instagram, including spam filtering technology and eventually computing systems to store content and operate the app.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Systrom said that Instagram had spam “under control,” and that the company already had a solid computing system technology infrastructure provided by Amazon.</p><p>The government’s case against Meta is part of a broad assault against the power of the biggest tech companies. Last week, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/technology/google-ad-tech-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">won an antitrust case against Google’s monopoly</a> in parts of ad technology, the second government victory after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/technology/google-search-remedies-hearing.html" title="">winning a case against Google’s search monopoly</a> last year. On Tuesday, in the same courthouse where Mr. Systrom testified, a judge heard arguments from the Justice Department to break up Google over its anticompetitive behavior to dominate search.</p><p>The F.T.C. and the D.O.J. have also sued Amazon and Apple over claims of anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>The Trump administration first sued Meta over allegations of an anticompetitive acquisition strategy in December 2020. The case is the third against a tech giant to go to trial in two years.</p><p>The F.T.C. is testing antitrust law with a novel case that relies on a rarely used legal theory that Meta sought to kill competition through mergers. The F.T.C. approved the purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The government’s questioning of Mr. Systrom focused on events from around the time he co-founded Instagram in 2010 as a photo-sharing app for mobile phones. From the time of its launch, growth was “exponential, unstoppable,” Mr. Systrom said. The app registered 25,000 users its first day. By January 2012, Instagram was adding 4 million users a month.</p><p>The government previously pressed Mr. Zuckerberg about the acquisitions, showing him internal communications about Meta’s growing rivalry with Instagram. Mr. Zuckerberg said in one email he sought to “neutralize” Instagram as a competitor.</p><p>In an email exchange on Feb. 11, 2012, Mr. Zuckerberg proposed Meta acquire Instagram and “keep their product running and just not add more features to it.” The F.T.C. said that demonstrated that Meta bought Instagram to kill it off.</p><p>The F.T.C. has also argued that other investors wanted to buy or pump funds into Instagram, something that could have transformed it into a true rival.</p><p>Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital and an investor in Instagram, said in video testimony on Monday that the venture capital firm would have been able provide funding to support the company’s growth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Instagram had investors feeling like it was “lightening in a bottle” he said. He wanted to invest more money into Instagram but faced intense competition.</p><p>There were “too many pigs at the trough,” Mr. Botha added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cecilia Kang reports on technology and regulatory policy for The Times from Washington.
