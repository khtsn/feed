And we’re going to speed up the process, too, at the same time.”</p><p>Within minutes, managers at the agency said they received a White House memo telling them to prepare for mass layoffs.</p><p>The memo, which was sent to leaders of multiple agencies, said that the federal government “is costly, inefficient, and deeply in debt.” It did not mention the 65 percent goal, but laid out steps for the E.P.A. to prepare for what is known as a reduction in force, which would result in eliminating jobs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The agency did not respond to a request to discuss Mr. Zeldin’s job-cutting goal.</p><p>The E.P.A. had 15,123 full-time employees at the end of December, according to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-03/fy-2025-epa-bib.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the latest budget</a>. A reduction of 65 percent would mean the loss of nearly 10,000 jobs, which would devastate the agency responsible for clean air and clean water, said Marie Owens Powell, the president of the agency’s biggest union, the American Federation of Government Employees.</p><p>Ms. Owens Powell said the administration had not informed the union about its 65 percent goal and that she had heard about it first from Mr. Trump on television.</p><p>“This is so much bigger than just 65 percent of the employees,” she said. “What does it really mean? It means 65 percent less people available to respond to natural disasters, which are happening more frequently, not less. It would mean 65 percent less people to respond to hazardous cleanups, to do air monitoring and lead abatement.”</p><p>Nicole Cantello, president of federation’s Local 704, which represents employees in the Midwest, said the result was that “polluters would have a holiday.”</p><p>Trump administration officials “really have no idea what we do, and they don’t want to see us as people who are protecting human health and the environment, and doing good,” she said. “They just want to attack us as faceless bureaucrats.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, the leading Democrat on the committee that oversees the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement that Mr. Zeldin was repeatedly asked at his confirmation hearing whether he supported mass layoffs.</p><p>“Each time, he responded that he looked forward to working collaboratively with E.P.A.’s dedicated staff,” Mr. Whitehouse said. “It is now clear that the fix was in from the very beginning, to help the looters and polluters who bankrolled President Trump’s campaign.”</p><p>The fossil fuel industry, which includes petrochemical manufacturers, donated heavily to Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to remove regulations that add to their costs. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/climate/epa-staff-oil-gas-chemical-industry-lobbyists.html" title="">populated the senior ranks at the E.P.A.</a> with people who have served as lawyers and lobbyists for the oil and chemical industries, many of whom worked in his first administration to weaken climate and pollution protections.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Zeldin have repeatedly said they intend to ensure the country has clean air and water. Mr. Whitehouse said that “cannot mask the cruel reality that those goals fail if E.P.A. is disabled.”</p><p>In the past weeks, the Trump administration has fired 388 probationary employees at the agency and put 168 others on administrative leave, most of whom work on protecting poor and minority communities that face disproportionate levels of pollution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>During his first term Mr. Trump promised to eliminate the E.P.A. “in almost every form,” leaving “only tidbits” intact at the agency responsible for protecting the air and water from pollution, toxic chemicals and climate change.</p><p>The agency saw severe cuts to both its budget and staffing during those years, but it began rebuilding during the Biden administration. It was budgeted to have about 17,000 full-time employees this year, roughly the staffing levels last seen during the Obama administration.</p><p>Myron Ebell, a longtime critic of the E.P.A. who led the agency transition team during Mr. Trump’s first term, said a 65 percent cut was a start. He said the E.P.A. had largely fulfilled its mission and could be downgraded to an agency that monitors and assists state environmental agencies.</p><p>“It could be an awful lot smaller,” said Mr. Ebell, who does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that the planet is warming because of human activity.</p><p>The White House memo was issued by Russell T. Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, along with Charles Ezell, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management. It said that voters “registered their verdict on the bloated, corrupt federal bureaucracy” in the November election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund unproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups, while hurting hard-working American citizens,” it said. The memo directs agency heads to develop “agency reorganization plans” by March 13 and said those plans should seek to achieve “a significant reduction” in the number of full time employees as well as “a reduced real property footprint.”</p><p>The E.P.A. was created by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970, the year after the Cuyahoga River in Ohio became so polluted that it caught fire and shocked the nation. The fire helped galvanize a national environmental movement and Congress passed a series of major laws, including the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, the E.P.A. became a focal point for another environmental crisis, climate change. The agency moved to limit the greenhouse gases from automobiles and power plants that scientists say are dangerously heating the planet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lisa Friedman is a Times reporter who writes about how governments are addressing climate change and the effects of those policies on communities.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lisa-friedman">More about Lisa Friedman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/environmental-protection-agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/american-federation-of-government-employees">American Federation of Government Employees</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Bid to Punish Perceived Rivals: </strong>President Trump said that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/trump-jack-smith-law-firm-security.html">strip security clearances from lawyers at a prominent Washington law firm aiding Jack Smith</a>, who led investigations into Trump as special counsel, and end any federal government work the firm may have.</p></li><li><p><strong>Former Lobbyist at the E.P.A.: </strong>Lynn Dekleva, who recently took a senior role at the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/climate/epa-lynn-dekleva-formaldehyde.html">once led an aggressive effort by industry to block regulations on formaldehyde</a>, which can cause cancer and severe respiratory problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>America’s New Friends: </strong>When it comes to the war in Ukraine, Trump finds common cause with Russia, North Korea and Belarus — the world’s outlier states — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-diplomacy.html">stands against traditional U.S. allies</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump Eyes the Postal Service</strong><strong>: </strong>Trump’s attempt to exert more control over the U.S. Postal Service has fueled concerns that those efforts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-usps.html">could hurt the agency’s ability to reliably deliver mail</a> to all corners of the country, a mandate that is core to its mission.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dr. Oz’s Financial Ties: </strong>The Times’s examination of the myriad financial interests of Dr. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV doctor nominated to oversee Medicare and Medicaid, revealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/health/dr-oz-medicare-finances-conflicts.html">opaque ties with the industries he may soon regulate</a> as well as a coziness with health care companies that has lawmakers questioning his independence.</p></li><li><p><strong>F.D.A.
