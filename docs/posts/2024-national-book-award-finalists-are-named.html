The winners of the National Book Award, among the most prestigious literary prizes in the United States, will be announced in November.</p><p>The fiction finalists also included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/05/style/miranda-july-all-fours-profile.html#:~:text=In%20her%20new%20novel%2C%20%E2%80%9CAll,turning%20point%20in%20her%20life." title="">Miranda July</a>’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/books/review/all-fours-miranda-july.html" title="">All Fours</a>,” about a 45-year-old artist whose road trip is cut short for a torrid affair. ’Pemi Aguda’s “Ghostroots,” a debut short story collection set in Lagos, Nigeria, was also on the list, as was “Martyr!” by Kaveh Akbar, a book about addiction, grief and art, and “My Friends,” by Hisham Matar, which follows three Libyan exiles living in Britain.</p><p>In the nonfiction category, Kate Manne’s “Unshrinking: How to Face Fatphobia” explores weight stigma in different facets of society, including health care and employment. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/books/review/circle-of-hope-eliza-griswold.html" title="">Circle of Hope</a>: A Reckoning with Love, Power, and Justice in an American Church,” by Eliza Griswold, who won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction, documents the rise and fall of a progressive Christian church.

RedCherries, who was nominated for her debut poetry collection, “mother,” which is about an Indigenous child who is adopted by a non-Indigenous family. Anne Carson’s “Wrong Norma” is made up of prose poems and drawings about everyday life. Fady Joudah’s collection “[…]” is about Palestinians and the horrors of war, and Lena Khalaf Tuffaha’s “Something About Living” is about the erasure of Palestinian history.</p><p>In translated literature, Bothayna Al-Essa’s “The Book Censor’s Library” is set in a dystopian future. It was translated from Arabic by Ranya Abdelrahman and Sawad Hussain. “Taiwan Travelogue,” by Yáng Shuāng-zǐ and translated from Mandarin Chinese by Lin King,<strong> </strong>is about a Japanese writer and her relationship with her Taiwanese interpreter. “Where the Wind Calls Home,” by Samar Yazbek, translated from Arabic by Leri Price, is told through a 19-year-old soldier who is trying to survive the Syrian Civil War. “The Villain’s Dance,” by Fiston Mwanza Mujila, was translated from French by Roland Glasser and “Ædnan” by Linnea Axelsson was translated from Swedish by Saskia Vogel.</p><p>“The Great Cool Ranch Dorito in the Sky,” by Josh Galarza, is one of the finalists in young people’s literature. In that debut novel, a child’s diary goes viral on social media. Shifa Saltagi Safadi’s “Kareem Between,” a novel in verse, tells the story of a Syrian American teenager pulled between different worlds and cultures. “Buffalo Dreamer” is inspired by the family history of its author, Violet Duncan. “The Unboxing of a Black Girl” by Angela Shanté is about Black girlhood, and “The First State of Being” by Erin Entrada Kelly is about time travel and friendship.</p><p>At the awards ceremony next month, two lifetime achievement prizes will also be given out. One will go to the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Barbara Kingsolver, who will receive the organization’s annual medal for distinguished contribution to American letters. W. Paul Coates, the publisher and founder of Black Classic Press, will receive the foundation’s Literarian Award for outstanding service to the American literary community.</p><h2 id="link-4729bcd2">Fiction</h2><ul><li><p>‘Pemi Aguda, “Ghostroots”</p></li><li><p>Kaveh Akbar, “Martyr!”</p></li><li><p>Percival Everett, “James”</p></li><li><p>Miranda July, “All Fours&#34;</p></li><li><p>Hisham Matar, “My Friends”</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-4700b7ab">Nonfiction</h2><ul><li><p>Jason De León, &#34;Soldiers and Kings: Survival and Hope in the World of Human Smuggling”</p></li><li><p>Eliza Griswold, “Circle of Hope: A Reckoning with Love, Power, and Justice in an American Church”</p></li><li><p>Kate Manne, “Unshrinking: How to Face Fatphobia&#34;</p></li><li><p>Salman Rushdie, “Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder”</p></li><li><p>Deborah Jackson Taffa, “Whiskey Tender&#34;</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-64bdc25">Poetry</h2><ul><li><p>Anne Carson, “Wrong Norma”</p></li><li><p>Fady Joudah, “[…]&#34;</p></li><li><p>m.s.
