    <h1>Trump Fires 17 Inspectors General in Late-Night Purge</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the time, Mr. Trump was dealing with a raging coronavirus pandemic across the country, but he also was seeking to reshape the government to remove people he saw as trying to damage him. That included Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community, who dealt with the anonymous whistle-blower complaint that led to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment by the House.</p><p>Democrats accused Mr. Trump of trying to gut the independent offices.</p><p>Mr. Horowitz delivered to the Justice Department in late 2019 a report about the F.B.I. investigation of potential links between his campaign and Russians that began in 2016, called Crossfire Hurricane.</p><p>Mr. Horowitz found that the F.B.I. had a valid basis for opening the investigation, but he was critical of the application for a warrant to secretly monitor a Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. He also said the F.B.I. director at the time the investigation was opened, James B. Comey, had violated the department’s policy with secret memos about his interactions with Mr. Trump that later became public.</p><p>The Justice Department declined to prosecute Mr. Comey, a decision that infuriated Mr. Trump.</p></div></div>
