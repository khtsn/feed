In his February message, he said the P.K.K.’s armed struggle had outlived its initial purpose.</p><p>The P.K.K. began as a secessionist group that sought to create an independent state for Turkey’s Kurdish minority. More recently, it has said that it sought greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey.</p><p>In a statement on Monday, the group said it had “carried the Kurdish issue to a level where it can be solved by democratic politics, and the P.K.K. has completed its mission in that sense.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The group said Mr. Ocalan should lead the process of disarming and it called on Turkey’s Parliament to be part of it.</p><p>The decision could end one of the most enduring security problems in Turkey and deliver a significant political victory to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p><p>The move could end a<span>  </span>conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives. </p><p>The P.K.K.’s declaration could also have profound influence over other Kurdish militias, particularly in Syria, and shift regional dynamics beyond Turkey’s borders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdistan Workers’ Party fighters in northern Iraq in 2018. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ceerwan Aziz/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Kurds — an ethnic group of roughly 40 million — are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/middleeast/turkey-kurds-pkk.html#link-2fa1d7f3" title="">spread</a> across Turkey, Syria, Iran, and Iraq.

Turkey has repeatedly bombarded P.K.K. strongholds in northern Iraq, as well as the group’s offshoot controlling the northeastern regions of Syria, branding them a terrorist threat near its borders.</p><p>Turkish officials have insisted publicly that the government offered no concessions to the P.K.K. to persuade it to disarm. But officials from Turkey’s main pro-Kurdish party have expressed hope that the government would expand cultural and educational rights for Kurds.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
