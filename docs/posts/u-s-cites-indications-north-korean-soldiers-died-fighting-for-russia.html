    <h1>U.S. Cites ‘Indications’ North Korean Soldiers Died Fighting for Russia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The entry of North Korea into the war with Ukraine has marked a serious escalation in the conflict, one with consequences for Asia and the West.</p><p>The decision by President Biden a month ago to allow Ukraine to use American long-range missiles against certain military targets in Russia was in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-atacms-missiles.html" title="">response</a> to Russia’s decision to bring North Korean troops into the war, U.S. officials said.</p><p>In June, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Kim Jung-un, North Korea’s leader, revived a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/world/asia/putin-meets-kim-north-korea.html" title="">mutual defense pledge</a>, deepening ties that stretch beyond the Cold War.</p><p>Ukraine and South Korea first warned about the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-north-koreans-fighting-with-russians-ukraine-2024-10-13/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">movement</a> of North Korean troops to Russia in mid-October. In early November, General Ryder said that at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine.html" title="">least 10,000</a> North Korean troops had traveled thousands of miles from eastern Russia to the Kursk region, which borders Ukraine.</p><p>While there have been daily rumors about the North Koreans — about what they are eating, where they are and how they are communicating with Russians — this was the first official confirmation by the Pentagon that the North Koreans are actually fighting in Kursk.</p></div></div>
