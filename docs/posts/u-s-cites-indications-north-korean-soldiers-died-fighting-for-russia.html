Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters on Monday that the North Koreans had entered combat last week in the Russian region of Kursk, where Russia has been trying to recapture territory that Ukraine seized in a surprise cross-border offensive starting in August.</p><p>“We do assess that North Korean soldiers have engaged in combat in Kursk,” General Ryder said. “We do have indications that they have suffered casualties, both killed and wounded.”</p><p>On Monday, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said at least 30 North Korean soldiers had been killed or injured along the front line in Kursk over the weekend, in the Russian villages of Plekhovo, Vorozhba and Martynovka.
