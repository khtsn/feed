    <h1>Biden Says Netanyahu Is Not Doing Enough to Free Israeli Hostages</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>White House officials are considering pushing another “final” draft of the agreement in coming days, after the region has cooled off from the execution of the hostages.</p><p>There have been other final drafts. A week and a half ago, White House and State Department officials said there would be a meeting of the negotiators, except for Hamas, to approve a final accord. That meeting never happened after Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, rejected elements of it, and Mr. Netanyahu insisted on the continued military presence in the corridor.</p><p>After the Situation Room meeting on Monday, Mr. Biden said little about his strategy over the next days and weeks, including whether there would be a presentation of another final draft. “We’re in the middle of negotiations,’’ Mr. Biden said to reporters after the meeting, on the way to a campaign event with Ms. Harris in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Mr. Biden ignored a question about Mr. Netanyahu’s defiant stance during a news conference in Israel on Monday, when the prime minister questioned what message it would send to Hamas after the deaths of the hostages if Israel let up in the fighting. “Slay hostages and you’ll get concessions?” the prime minister said.</p><p>Mr. Biden would only say that “we’re still in negotiations — not with him, but with my colleagues from Qatar and Egypt.”</p><p>Ms. Harris did not talk about the strategy. At the Democratic National Convention two weeks ago, she strongly backed Israel, while saying more had to be done to relieve the sufferings of the Palestinian people. But she has been careful to hew closely to the administration’s current policy, and deflected calls from the progressive wing of the party to cut off some or all weapons shipments to Israel, a step the British took on Monday.</p><p>The British decision puts its government and Washington at odds on the tactics for dealing with Mr. Netanyahu. Washington suspended export of 2,000-pound bombs earlier this year, saying their use could lead to wide civilian casualties and were not needed by the Israelis. But Britain has gone further. David Lammy, Britain’s foreign secretary, said that a legal review concluded there was “clear risk” that a number of weapons would be used in ways that would breach international law. Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris have not reached a similar conclusion.</p><p>Still, Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu have clashed often in the past 10 months, and with particular intensity since the spring. White House officials thought they were near a hostage deal in mid-July, one of several moments in which they believed — and Mr. Biden publicly declared — that the negotiations mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt would result in a temporary cease-fire, with hopes of a longer-lasting one.</p><p>Other obstacles to a deal have come from Mr. Sinwar, the Hamas leader, who has been engaged in the negotiations remotely as he hides out, presumably underground in Gaza. Israeli military and intelligence officials, with American help, are hunting for Mr. Sinwar, considered the lead architect of the Oct. 7 attack that killed roughly 1,100 Israelis.</p></div></div>
