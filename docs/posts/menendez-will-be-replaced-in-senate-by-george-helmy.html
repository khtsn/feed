Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey has selected George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to serve out the remainder of the term of Senator Robert Menendez, who was convicted of corruption and is stepping down next week, according to three people familiar with the decision.</p><p>Mr. Murphy plans to formally announce the selection in Newark on Friday, according to the three people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the choice. Mr. Helmy, one of the governor’s longest-serving inner-circle loyalists, is expected to be sworn in when the Senate returns from its summer recess in September. The term ends in January.</p><p>Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, was found guilty last month of taking bribes and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/nyregion/senator-bob-menendez-trial.html" title="">acting as an agent of a foreign government</a> after a two-month trial in Manhattan. He plans to appeal the verdict, but has said he intends to leave office on Aug. 20 to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/23/nyregion/menendez-letter.html" title="">avoid becoming a distraction</a> to the Senate’s “important work.”</p><p>In tapping Mr. Helmy for the temporary position, Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, bypassed several women who were under consideration. He also passed over Representative Andy Kim, a third-term congressman and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/nyregion/andy-kim-nj-primary-senate.html" title="">Democratic nominee</a> for Senate, who won the primary with 75 percent of the vote.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Kim, 42, is considered the favorite in the November race against Curtis Bashaw, the Republican nominee. Being appointed to the job several months early could have given Mr. Kim a seniority edge and a possible head start toward preferred committee assignments. But Mr. Murphy’s closest advisers had said from the start that the governor was unlikely to select Mr. Kim, who for months was locked in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/14/nyregion/tammy-murphy-andy-kim-menendez.html" title="">bruising competition for Mr. Menendez’s seat</a> with the governor’s wife, Tammy Murphy.</p><p>Mr. Helmy has worked for both Senator Cory Booker and former Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/nyregion/frank-lautenberg-new-jersey-senator.html" title="">Frank Lautenberg</a>, experience the governor’s aides said was important to Mr. Murphy.</p><p>Mr. Helmy, 44, was Mr. Murphy’s chief of staff from early 2019 through September 2023, when he resigned to take a job managing lobbyists for a large health care network. He has remained one of the governor’s closest advisers.</p><p>Mr. Helmy is likely to work closely in Washington with Mr. Booker, his former boss, who, according to an aide, had publicly and privately urged the governor to appoint Mr. Kim.</p><p>The four-month stint in Washington and the prorated $174,000 salary could result in a pension boost for Mr. Helmy, who worked for about seven years as a Senate staff member. Members of Congress must have at least <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL30631" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five years of federal service</a> to qualify for a pension at 62; the pension amount depends on length of service and the average of the highest three years of salary.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The title is also likely to carry benefits that outlive Mr. Helmy’s time in the Capitol. Jeffrey Chiesa, a New Jersey lawyer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/nyregion/in-new-jersey-scrambling-to-vie-for-a-senate-seat.html" title="">appointed to the Senate in 2013</a> by former Gov. Chris Christie after Mr. Lautenberg died, emphasizes his five months in Washington in a biography that remains prominently displayed on his law firm’s website.</p><p>Hours after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/nyregion/senator-bob-menendez-resignation.html" title="">Mr. Menendez announced</a> last month that he would resign, Ms. Murphy said she would not accept an appointment by her husband to the seat. During her campaign, Ms. Murphy, a first-time candidate, was battered by concerns about her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/14/nyregion/tammy-murphy-andy-kim-menendez.html" title="">limited experience</a>, her longtime <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/nyregion/tammy-murphy-senate-robert-menendez-seat.html" title="">affiliation with the Republican Party</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/nyregion/menendez-tammy-murphy-senate-new-jersey.html" title="">governor’s influence</a> in boosting her odds of winning the coveted job. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/nyregion/tammy-murphy-new-jersey-political-machine.html" title="">dropped out</a> of the Democratic primary in March.</p><p>Aides to the governor said the short list of candidates to replace Mr. Menendez included <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/admin/lt/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tahesha Way</a>, the state’s lieutenant governor; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-jersey-trenton-corzine-names-first-cabinet.html" title="">Nina Mitchell Wells</a>, a former New Jersey secretary of state; Representative <a href="https://watsoncoleman.house.gov/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bonnie Watson Coleman</a>, the first Black woman to represent New Jersey in Congress; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/us/jeh-c-johnson-will-be-nominated-as-homeland-security-chief.html" title="">Jeh C. Johnson</a>, Homeland Security secretary under former President Barack Obama. Some state lawmakers had also urged Mr. Murphy to appoint Patricia Campos-Medina, a labor leader who ran for the Senate nomination against Mr. Kim and garnered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/04/us/elections/results-new-jersey-us-senate-primary.html" title="">16 percent</a> of the vote.</p><p>The selection of a woman would have represented a history-making — if brief — moment for New Jersey. The state has had one female governor, Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, but has never sent a woman to the U.S. Senate.</p><p>Mr. Helmy left his job working for Mr. Murphy in the State House last year to join RWJBarnabas Health as an executive vice president for external affairs and policy. A resident of Morris County, N.J., he also sits on the powerful board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates five <a href="https://www.panynj.gov/airports/en/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">airports</a>, six <a href="https://www.panynj.gov/port-authority/en/help-center/faq/bridges-and-tunnels-faq.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bridges and tunnels</a>, the PATH rail system, a bus terminal and the World Trade Center.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He is one of five <a href="https://www.panynj.gov/corporate/en/government-ethics/board-of-commissioners.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">board members</a> — four men and one woman — nominated by Mr. Murphy. In 2023, another one of Mr. Murphy’s appointees to the Port Authority, Rob Menendez, the son of Senator Menendez, <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/menendez-resigns-port-authority-post/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resigned from the board</a> after he was elected to the House of Representatives.</p><p>A Port Authority spokesman had no comment on whether Mr. Helmy would be required to resign, as Representative Menendez did.</p><p>A spokeswoman for RWJBarnabas Health, one of the state’s largest health care networks, also declined to comment about how the Senate appointment would affect Mr. Helmy’s job. She referred questions about Mr. Helmy’s employment at the company to the governor’s office.</p><p>Senator Menendez, 70, will be sentenced in the corruption case in late October, and his political career is almost certainly over. But he has not formally suspended his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/nyregion/senator-robert-menendez-independent-campaign.html" title="">long-shot bid for re-election</a> as an independent; he has until Friday to remove his name from the ballot.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tracey-tully">More about Tracey Tully</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tragic End to an Instagram-Perfect Hamptons Life: </strong>A couple showed the public a world of glittering parties and vacations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/nyregion/brandon-miller-suicide-debt.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The money to sustain it did not exist</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brooklyn’s Great Goldfish Heist: </strong>In Bedford-Stuyvesant, an animal lover thought she was doing the right thing by freeing fish from a sidewalk pit. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/goldfish-sidewalk-pond-brooklyn.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">But was it a rescue or a robbery</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Zombie Pharmacies: </strong>Over a million square feet of prime real estate is collecting dust across New York City. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/pharmacies-vacant-drugstores-retail.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">It could stay that way for years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Street Wars: </strong>New York City bus stops without trees or shelter are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/nyregion/street-wars-hot-bus-stops.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">leaving riders sweating</a> as they wait — and wait — for buses that a transportation group says do not come fast enough.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine: </strong>Jackie Chang, a subway mosaic artist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/nyregion/jackie-chang-subway-mosaics.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">spends her Sundays</a> designing in her studio, making Taiwanese breakfast and practicing violin.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div>
