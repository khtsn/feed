The crew handed out water and snacks to the passengers, she said.</p><p>Ms. Meng said she was booked on another American flight around 3 p.m. and was rushing to get to a memorial service later in the day for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/us/politics/nita-m-lowey-dead.html" title="">Nita M. Lowey</a>, a Democrat who represented Westchester County in the House for three decades. Ms. Lowey died last month at 87.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. LaLota posted about the experience on social media shortly after the accident.</p><p>“Serving in Congress has come with some once in a lifetime experiences… like just now while stationary on the runway at DCA, another plane just bumped into our wing,” he wrote on X, using the three-letter airport code for Reagan Airport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It’s not unusual to spot members of Congress on commercial flights at Reagan Airport, especially during breaks on Capitol Hill. The lawmakers quickly began chronicling the mishap on social media.</p><p>The episode brought further scrutiny to safety procedures at the Reagan Airport, where an American Airlines regional jet making its final approach was struck by an Army helicopter on Jan. 29, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-dc-helicopter-reagan-airport.html" title="">killing all 67 people aboard the two aircraft</a>. That crash was the deadliest in the United States in 20 years.</p><p>American Airlines said that there were 67 passengers and four crew members on the flight bound for Kennedy and 76 passengers and four crew members on the Bombardier CRJ-900 that was heading for South Carolina.</p><p>“Safety is our top priority, and we apologize to our customers for their experience,” the airline said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some of the Democrats who were on the plane that was clipped used the incident to level fresh criticism at the Trump administration, which they said was undermining safety by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-firings-faa.html" title="">laying off about 400 employees</a> at the Federal Aviation Administration as part of a cost-cutting initiative spearheaded by Elon Musk. The Trump administration has insisted that air traffic controllers, of which there is a shortage, were not included in the cuts.</p><p>“Just a reminder: Recent cuts to the FAA weaken our skies and public safety,” Mr. Gottheimer <a href="https://x.com/RepJoshG/status/1910384486782550385" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>.</p><p>Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, pushed back against the criticism in a <a href="https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1910417536459342218" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a> responding to Mr. Gottheimer.</p><p>“Glad to hear everyone on board is safe,” Mr. Duffy said. “But stop the fear mongering and let’s stick to the facts. No safety-critical positions at the FAA have been cut.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neil Vigdor covers breaking news for The Times, with a focus on politics.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
