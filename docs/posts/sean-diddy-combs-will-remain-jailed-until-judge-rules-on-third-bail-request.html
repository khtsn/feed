Mr. Combs, 55, has been detained since his arrest two months ago after a nearly 10-month federal investigation. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><p>Mr. Combs, in tan jail clothes, entered the courtroom smiling, and mouthed “love you” to his mother and six of his children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The central question of the hearing was whether he could be trusted to follow his lawyers’ commands and follow the specifications of his release if granted bail. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Combs of contacting grand jury witnesses, paying a potential witness to make a statement in his favor and attempting to use three-way phone calls from jail to contact associates whom prosecutors consider part of his “criminal enterprise.”</p><p>The judge queried both sides closely, noting some evidence that Mr. Combs had not fully obeyed his lawyers, while also indicating some skepticism of the government’s argument that he was trying to obstruct the case from jail. (That included an allegation that Mr. Combs had orchestrated a social media post on his birthday that prosecutors said was intended to influence potential jurors.)</p><p>But the judge acknowledged there was some evidence that Mr. Combs did not always follow jail policies around communicating with the outside world, even when he knew his behavior was being closely monitored.</p><p>“Even a minor infraction is puzzling,” the judge said.</p><p>After his arrest in September, Mr. Combs’s lawyers proposed a robust bail package that they said was more than sufficient to assuage the court’s concerns about the risks of his release. They offered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-bail-appeal-private-security.html" title="">a $50 million bond</a>, secured by Mr. Combs’s Florida mansion, and said he would pay for round-the-clock security at his home, with visitors restricted to family and lawyers.</p><p>After one of the defendants’s lawyers acknowledged that the Miami-area mansion had access to a dock, the judge swiftly ruled out that location as a place for Mr. Combs to be housed if he was granted bail. “That’s not going to work,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As an alternative, the defense suggested a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan where three private security officers would be stationed at once.</p><p>The prosecution argued that regardless of the restrictions that would be put on Mr. Combs outside of jail, his lawyers had an “inability to control their client.” They cited as an example Mr. Combs’s communications with a grand jury witness, whom they described as an escort who participated in multiple “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html" title="">freak-offs</a>” — the drug-fueled sexual encounters at the heart of the case — as recently as August. Some of those communications were deleted from his phone, she said.</p><p>“The defendant, simply put, can’t be trusted,” said Christy Slavik, one of the prosecutors.</p><p>Mr. Combs’s lawyers disputed the idea that Mr. Combs was uncooperative, noting that he had flown to New York to face the charges even before an indictment was unsealed and was attentive to his lawyers’ directions on how to communicate from jail.</p><p>“The idea that he’s just a lawless person who doesn’t follow instructions — that’s just not factually accurate,” said one of his lawyers, Anthony Ricco.</p><p>The first two judges who considered the bail issue were persuaded by the government’s arguments that Mr. Combs posed a danger to the safety of others, relying largely on leaked hotel footage from 2016 of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video.html" title="">Mr. Combs abusing his girlfriend</a>, Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, which was broadcast in May by CNN. Ms. Ventura, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">filed a bombshell civil suit a year ago</a>, is the center of the government’s case, though she is identified only as “Victim-1” in its indictment.</p><p>In their third attempt at securing bail, Mr. Combs’s lawyers sought to undercut the impact of that video by arguing that the government had not presented the footage in good faith, accusing prosecutors of omitting key scenes and presenting events out of order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Combs’s lawyers have argued that their defendant’s contacts with witnesses have been entirely “innocuous” and simply intended to help build up his defense for trial. They underscored that the government had pointed to no communications indicating threats or pressure, and they characterized the accusations about him breaking jail policy around phone privileges as “overblown.”</p><p>The grand jury has continued to meet since Mr. Combs was charged and prosecutors have said that their investigation is continuing.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>22</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Combs Will Remain in Brooklyn Jail Until Judge Rules on Third Bail Request<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
