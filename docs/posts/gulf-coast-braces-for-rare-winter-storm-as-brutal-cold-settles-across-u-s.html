The Houston metropolitan area was preparing for what could be “a historic snowfall in terms of modern history,” said Bradley Brokamp, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service there. The area could see between 4 and 6 inches of wet snow starting Monday night into Tuesday afternoon, he said.</p><p>The last time Houston recorded six inches of snow was in 1886. More recently, Houston recorded 2.5 inches of snow in 1973, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Brokamp said the early morning commute on Tuesday could be “extremely dangerous” and that the National Weather Service was advising drivers to stay off the roads “at all costs,” he said.</p><p>More than 40 million people were under some form of severe winter weather advisory. The cold and snow shuttered school campuses across the South for Tuesday, and in some cases, through Wednesday as well, from <a href="https://x.com/UTAustinOEM/status/1881324572848353336" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Austin</a> and <a href="https://x.com/RiceUniversity/status/1881162253111529680" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Houston</a> to <a href="https://x.com/LSU/status/1881396515496685937" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baton Rouge</a> and <a href="https://tulane.edu/emergency" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Orleans</a>, to <a href="https://alerts.fsu.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tallahassee, Fla.</a> There were delays announced in <a href="https://www.ccsdschools.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">South Carolina</a> and Georgia.</p><p>Elsewhere in the country, temperatures in the northern Plains and Upper Midwest were expected to hit the negative teens or single digits, and the Rockies, central Plains and Midwest were likely to see highs in the single digits or teens. With wind chills as severe as 20 to 30 degrees below zero expected along with snow, school closures were announced in parts of <a href="https://x.com/DMschools/status/1881421109809295541" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Iowa</a>, <a href="https://x.com/mentorschools/status/1881420721328640332" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ohio</a> and Minnesota.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The southern storm system is forecast to sweep across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, North Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist at the Weather Service. Heavy snow is expected along and near the Interstate 10 corridor, while sleet and freezing rain are forecast for parts of southern Texas, southeast Georgia and northern Florida.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Numerous <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=usa&amp;wwa=Freeze%20Warning" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">freeze warnings</a> were in place in the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, as subfreezing morning temperatures could threaten sensitive plants and exposed plumbing. These frigid conditions are expected to persist for the next few days over eastern and southern parts of the country.</p><p>Department of Transportation workers in Texas and Louisana were <a href="https://x.com/La_DOTD/status/1881359719505485895" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">treating major highways with salt and brine</a> <a href="https://x.com/TxDOTSanAngelo/status/1881393727056601314" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ahead of the storm</a> on Monday afternoon. The Texas transportation department <a href="https://x.com/TxDOTBryan/status/1881362210812997799" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it had treated 3,000 lane miles of roads on Sunday.</p><p>Major travel disruptions, with flight delays and cancellations, are also anticipated, given these areas are not equipped to handle winter weather, Mr. Chenard added. The Houston Airport System, which includes George Bush Intercontinental Airport, William P. Hobby Airport and Ellington Airport, said it would <a href="https://www.fly2houston.com/alerts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shutter all flight operations</a> beginning midnight Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Strong winds and the weight of snow on tree limbs may bring down power lines and cause sporadic power outages.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Weather Service has issued <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=usa&amp;wwa=Winter%20Storm%20Warning" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">winter storm warnings</a> for southern areas of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and northwest Florida. Total snow accumulations over southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana are expected to be between two and six inches.</p><p>Bitter cold and winter storm impacts are expected to linger across the Southeast and eastern United States until at least midweek. Dangerous driving conditions and travel disruptions are likely to continue for a few days in the South after the storm clears, Mr. Chenard said: “Given the cold air still in place, it might take a little while for things to melt out.”</p><p>The southern storm comes as the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic were digging out of weekend snowfall, which left behind some of the largest accumulations of the season. Two towns in West Virginia, Thomas and Elkins, each recorded 16 inches. Accident, Md., just south of the Pennsylvania border, recorded 14.5 inches. In New York, the largest totals were north of New York City, with around eight inches in Fahnestock State Park, Highland Mills and Hopewell Junction. Central Park recorded 1.6 inches.</p><p>In Washington, D.C., which received a little less than an inch of snow on Sunday, temperatures measured 28 degrees at noon on Monday, the National Weather Service said, making this one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/inauguration-forecast-cold-history.html" title="">the coldest Inauguration Days in decades</a>.</p><p>Frigid temperatures in many areas will feel even more severe because of dangerous wind chills, particularly in the Rockies, northern Plains and Upper Midwest. These areas are forecast to have wind chills as low as 30 to 55 degrees below zero through Tuesday morning, levels that pose a severe risk of frostbite and hypothermia to anyone with exposed skin, the Weather Service warned. Even areas as far south as the south-central Plains and the Ohio Valley will experience subzero wind chills by the middle of the week.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
