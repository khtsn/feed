When I was an assistant at a legendary publishing company in my early 20s, some of the editors smoked in their offices. I used to love to go dancing, but it meant coming home coated with the acrid stench of cigarette smoke clinging to my clothes and absorbed into my hair.</p><p>The subways are now scrubbed of graffiti. The buses, instead of spewing exhaust, are hybrid or electric. Smoking indoors is rare.</p><p>But the streets that were clogged with cars in my youth continue to be choked with traffic.</p><p>People who study cities and think deeply about how they function agree that reclaiming some space from cars is crucial.</p><p>“Our streets were not built for cars,” said John Massengale, an <a href="https://urbanist.massengale.com/street.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">architect and urbanist</a> and a co-author of “Street Design: The Secret to Great Cities and Towns.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mulberry Street around 1900. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Massengale is fond of posting a photo on social media of <a href="https://x.com/jmassengale/status/1828199789034414214/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mulberry Street in the early 1900s</a>, bustling with people socializing and shopping, as a response to people who claim that streets are for cars. It’s an example of how New York’s streets were once used, and could be again.</p><p>Massengale’s book highlights <a href="https://x.com/jmassengale/status/1820153165041586495" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lexington Avenue</a>, where the sidewalk was narrowed, most recently in 1960, to make more room for cars, as part of the problem. “Driving is not the point of a city,” he said.</p><p>(One of Massengale’s most radical ideas? <a href="https://urbanist.massengale.com/BrooklynBridgeChange.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Removing cars from the Brooklyn Bridge</a> and turning it into a park, with cycling paths and food carts: “It would be as popular as the High Line.”)</p><p>Nicole Gelinas, author of “Movement: New York’s Long War to Take Back Its Streets From the Car,” agrees that fewer cars would make for a better New York City.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We’re not going to recover from Covid and from population dislocations and so forth by re-embracing the car,” she said. “You could pave over every single sidewalk and give it to cars and you would still have traffic problems.”</p><p>Gelinas said that we need to get people back into the mass transit system and to continue to make it easier and safer for buses, bicycles and people on foot. “As long as we’re continuing to make slow progress doing those things, we are heading in the right direction and not the wrong direction,” she said.</p><p>While she’d like to see the city streets safe enough that people feel comfortable biking with their children to school, in her mind, not all bikes are equal. “We have not dealt with the e-bikes very well,” she said. “Having the bike lanes largely taken over by a poorly regulated commercial exploitative business, which is the app delivery, is not a good thing for the future of New York City cycling.”</p><p>The good news is that even though congestion pricing stalled out, big changes are in the works, with more coming.</p><p>Broadway below Herald Square in Manhattan has transformed into a <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/nyc-dot-latest-redesign-union-sq.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared street</a>, with two-way bike lanes, seating and planters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>More new <a href="https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1837217773174378509" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bike infrastructure</a> is planned, including a <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/31/city-officials-unveil-bike-boulevard-design-for-31st-avenue-in-queens" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bike boulevard on 31st Avenue</a> in Queens, and one on <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2023/berry-st-bike-boulevard.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Berry Street in Brooklyn</a>.</p><p>Plus, existing bike lanes, on Manhattan’s Second Avenue, 10th Avenue, 38th Street and 39th Street, will soon be wider. Segments of bike lanes on Third Avenue and Ninth Avenue are also wider.</p><p>More room in the bike lane means more space for cyclists to pass one another and also allows for the opportunity to bike alongside a friend or family member. And New York City could see a cargo bike boom, like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-25/london-cargo-bikes-rising-to-curb-pollution-not-just-in-ulez-areas?cmpid=BBD092524_CITYLAB&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=240925&amp;utm_campaign=citylabdaily" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the one London is having</a>, which means deliveries of anything from food to laundry to heavy equipment arrive by eco-friendly electric cycles instead of polluting vans.</p><p>New York now has “busways” — protected and dedicated bus lanes — on 14th Street in Manhattan, on <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/jamaica-archer-busway-brochure.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jamaica and Archer Avenues</a> in Queens, and <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/nyc-dot-livingston-st-redesign.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn</a>.</p><p>While some of these things seem incremental, they start to add up.</p><p>“We envision a future of more people-centered streets,” said Ydanis Rodriguez, the commissioner of New York City’s Department of Transportation. “More plazas and pedestrian space, more outdoor dining, and a continued shift to smaller, safer and more efficient options like bikes, e-bikes and other legal micromobility options.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He added, “We will adapt our streets and bring about the culture shift needed to make these changes work for everyone.”</p><p>As for Massengale, he doesn’t believe that the city should be completely car-free. “New York needs cars,” he said. But he stressed that trying to alleviate congestion without removing some vehicles from the mix will always be unsuccessful.</p><p>“Traffic engineers do not lead the design teams that make the beautiful, safe, low-traffic streets for people we see in Europe,” he said.</p><p>“New York should do whatever it takes to change our streets now,” he added. “We’ve been a model for the nation, and can be again. No place in America is more ready for safe, slow, walkable streets.”</p><hr/></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Dodai Stewart writes about living in New York City, with a focus on how, and where, we gather.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
