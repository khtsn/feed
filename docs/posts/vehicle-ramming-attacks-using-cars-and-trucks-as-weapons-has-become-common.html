The tactic gives “marginal actors” the ability to “strike at the heart of urban centers and sow fear in the wider society,” they added.</p><p>After potential targets such as airports and public buildings became more heavily secured, especially after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, some terrorists and other assailants began to use vehicles against more vulnerable targets, such as groups of people congregating in public spaces.</p><h2 id="link-5544c805">What is the history of such attacks?</h2><p>Using vehicles to indiscriminately attack people has a long history, mostly unrelated to organized terrorism, such as the 22-year-old Czechoslovak woman who <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/olga-hepnarova" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed eight people in 1973</a>, citing her grievances against society.</p><p>Terrorist groups began using ramming attacks in the 1990s, according to a study by the Mineta Transportation Institute, part of San Jose State University. The majority of the 184 vehicle-ramming attacks between 1963 and mid-2019, when the study was published, took place in Israel and the West Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Islamist groups: </strong>In a 2010 article in its magazine, Inspire, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/world/europe/truck-attack-nice-france.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/world/europe/truck-attack-nice-france.html">Al Qaeda encouraged adherents</a> to use vehicles “to mow down the enemies of Allah.” But the tactic did not really catch on among would-be terrorists until several years later, when the Islamic State began to call publicly for vehicle attacks.</p><p><strong>New York City:</strong> A man drove a pickup truck into a crowded bike path in 2017 along the Hudson River in Manhattan, killing eight and injuring at least 11 before he was shot by the police. Notes found near the scene indicated the killer’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/police-shooting-lower-manhattan.html" title="">allegiance</a> to the Islamic State, authorities said.</p><p><strong>Israel and the West Bank: </strong>The use of vehicles as weapons <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/15/world/middleeast/israel-raanana-attack.html" title="">has become common</a>, with dozens of attacks by Palestinians against Israeli soldiers and civilians in the past few decades. The tactic became more prominent in the 2010s, during a wave of “lone wolf” attacks by Palestinians who were largely unaffiliated with organized armed groups.</p><p><strong>Nice, France:</strong> More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/world/europe/nice-bastille-day.html" title="">80 people were killed and hundreds injured</a> when a man drove a 19-ton truck through a crowd of spectators watching Bastille Day fireworks in southern France.
