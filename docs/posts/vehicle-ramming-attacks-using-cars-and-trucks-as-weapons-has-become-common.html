The authorities are investigating the attack as an act of terrorism.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-vehicle-crash#new-orleans-vehicle-crash" title="">incident</a> was the latest in a long string of vehicle-based attacks against crowds, dating back decades. Vehicle ramming did not start as a terrorist tactic, but it has frequently been used by extremist organizations and radicalized individuals to kill, injure and instill fear, using some of the most commonplace objects in modern life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-3afd031e">Why are vehicles used as weapons?</h2><p>Cars and trucks are ubiquitous, especially in the developed world, and can easily be repurposed into deadly weapons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Assailants with “limited access to explosives or weapons” can use vehicles to cause great harm “with minimal prior training or experience,” according to an F.B.I. <a href="https://info.publicintelligence.net/DHS-TerroristRamming.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">handout</a> on “Terrorist Use of Vehicle Ramming Tactics.”</p><p>Vehicle ramming attacks transform “a bland, everyday object into a lethal, semi-strategic weapon,” the researchers Vincent Miller and Keith Hayward <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/59/1/1/5052837#126685952" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in a 2019 study</a> published in The British Journal of Criminology. The tactic gives “marginal actors” the ability to “strike at the heart of urban centers and sow fear in the wider society,” they added.</p><p>After potential targets such as airports and public buildings became more heavily secured, especially after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, some terrorists and other assailants began to use vehicles against more vulnerable targets, such as groups of people congregating in public spaces.</p><h2 id="link-5544c805">What is the history of such attacks?</h2><p>Using vehicles to indiscriminately attack people has a long history, mostly unrelated to organized terrorism, such as the 22-year-old Czechoslovak woman who <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/olga-hepnarova" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed eight people in 1973</a>, citing her grievances against society.</p><p>Terrorist groups became using ramming attacks in the 1990s, according to a study by the Mineta Transportation Institute, part of San Jose State University. The majority of the 184 vehicle-ramming attacks between 1963 and mid-2019, when the study was published, took place in Israel and the West Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Islamist groups: </strong>In a 2010 article in its magazine, Inspire, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/world/europe/truck-attack-nice-france.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/world/europe/truck-attack-nice-france.html">Al Qaeda encouraged adherents</a> to use vehicles “to mow down the enemies of Allah.” But the tactic did not really catch on among would-be terrorists until several years later, when the Islamic State began to call publicly for vehicle attacks.</p><p><strong>New York City:</strong> A man drove a pickup truck into a crowded bike path in 2017 along the Hudson River in Manhattan, killing eight and injuring at least 11 before he was shot by the police. Notes found near the scene indicated the killer’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/police-shooting-lower-manhattan.html" title="">allegiance</a> to the Islamic State, authorities said.</p><p><strong>Israel and the West Bank: </strong>The use of vehicles as weapons <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/15/world/middleeast/israel-raanana-attack.html" title="">has become common</a>, with dozens of attacks by Palestinians against Israeli soldiers and civilians in the past few decades. The tactic became more prominent in the 2010s, during a wave of “lone wolf” attacks by Palestinians who were largely unaffiliated with organized armed groups.</p><p><strong>Nice, France:</strong> More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/world/europe/nice-bastille-day.html" title="">80 people were killed and hundreds injured</a> when a man drove a 19-ton truck through a crowd of spectators watching Bastille Day fireworks in southern France. The Islamic State <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/05/world/europe/france-nice-trial-terrorist-attack.html" title="">claimed responsibility</a> for the attack; investigators said the driver had been self-radicalized by watching jihadist videos, with no evidence linking him directly to the terrorist group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Charlottesville attack.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ryan M.

Weil, the deputy research director at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats of the University of Chicago.
