    <h1>What to Know About Israel’s Decision to Halt Aid to Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Israel attributed its extension proposal to the work of the new U.S. envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff. It would replace the original deal, negotiated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, which called for the next phase to include a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a commitment to a permanent cease-fire in return for the release of all remaining living hostages in Gaza.</p><h3 id="link-42bc0d20"><span>How has Hamas responded?</span></h3><p>Hamas issued a statement on Sunday describing the halt in aid as “cheap blackmail.” The group said Israel’s decision was a “blatant upending of the agreement,” and added that it remained willing to begin negotiations for the second stage of the deal.</p><h3 id="link-1e8962f"><span>What is the impact of the announcement?</span></h3><p>The halt, which does not apply to water, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/europe/israel-aid-gaza-cease-fire-proposal.html" title="">according to two Israeli officials</a>, is likely to cause further hardship to Palestinian civilians, many of whom are at the start of the holy month of Ramadan. Supplies of fuel, vital for bakeries, are also being halted.</p><p>Aside from stopping humanitarian aid, Israel’s decision is also likely to inflate the price of goods that have begun to appear in Gaza’s markets in greater quantities in recent weeks amid the lull in fighting.</p><p>Abdulrahman Mohammed, 35, a father of four from Gaza City, said the announcement had already caused a spike in the prices of essential goods.</p></div></div>
