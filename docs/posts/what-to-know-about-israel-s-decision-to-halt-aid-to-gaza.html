Here’s what to know:</p><h3 id="link-78f3d178"><span>What has Israel said?</span></h3><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel announced the halt to the flow of humanitarian assistance and goods hours after his government proposed a seven-week extension of the temporary cease-fire, at the start of which it said that Hamas would have to release half the remaining living hostages as well as the remains of half the deceased ones.</p><p>The decision was apparently part of a bid to force Hamas into accepting Israel’s cease-fire proposal.</p><p>Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that killed around 1,200 people, resulted in the seizure of around 250 hostages and set off the devastating war in Gaza. During the initial cease-fire, 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight dead ones were returned to Israel in exchange for about 1,500 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. That deal also allowed for a significant increase of aid to Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel attributed its extension proposal to the work of the new U.S. envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff. It would replace the original deal, negotiated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, which called for the next phase to include a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a commitment to a permanent cease-fire in return for the release of all remaining living hostages in Gaza.</p><h3 id="link-42bc0d20"><span>How has Hamas responded?</span></h3><p>Hamas issued a statement on Sunday describing the halt in aid as “cheap blackmail.” The group said Israel’s decision was a “blatant upending of the agreement,” and added that it remained willing to begin negotiations for the second stage of the deal.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
