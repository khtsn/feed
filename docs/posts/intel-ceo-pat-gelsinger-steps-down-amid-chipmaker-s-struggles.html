He will be replaced in the interim by two Intel executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, the company said in a statement on Monday, adding that it would continue its search for a permanent chief executive.</p><p>Intel’s abrupt change was the latest sign of the 56-year-old company’s fall from grace. Intel was one of the pioneers that gave Silicon Valley its name and for years was one of the world’s best-known tech names. But the company has been mired in recent years in innovation struggles and has ceded ground to rivals including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/technology/nvidia-earnings-chips-ai.html" title="">Nvidia</a>, the reigning maker of artificial intelligence chips.</p><p>In particular, Mr. Gelsinger’s exit suggested that Intel’s board of directors had lost faith in his plan to restore the company’s growth and a stock price that had slumped 52 percent this year. The company said his departure was a “retirement.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Frank Yeary, who will serve as interim executive chair on the board, said in a statement.</p><p>Intel’s struggles reached the point this year that Wall Street analysts began considering it a potential takeover candidate or a target for a breakup. The change also came amid signs that the company’s latest production process, a technology at the center of Mr. Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, might not restore Intel to a leadership position next year as he promised.</p><p>Intel, which makes chips that handle calculations in a majority of the world’s computers, lost its lead in developing manufacturing technology to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/technology/the-chip-titan-whose-lifes-work-is-at-the-center-of-a-tech-cold-war.html" title="">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a> toward the end of the last decade. It also missed out on supplying processors for mobile phones and, more recently, the booming market for A.I. applications.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger embarked on an ambitious plan to introduce five new production processes in four years while remaking Intel as a manufacturer for other chip designers, as well as producing its own products. He also spent much of his time pushing the Biden administration and Congress to pass a measure called the CHIPS Act, which was designed to encourage more U.S. production of the foundational silicon components.</p><p>As part of that lobbying effort, Mr. Gelsinger committed to building new factories in the United States and promised that Intel would catch up to TSMC’s technology by 2025.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But Mr. Gelsinger also hired aggressively as its latest microprocessors ran into slower demand and stiff competition. Revenue plunged more than 30 percent from 2021 through 2023. In October, the company posted a $16.6 billion quarterly loss, the biggest in its history.</p><p>Along the way, Intel’s stock market valuation withered as Nvidia turned into one of the world’s most valuable companies.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger, acknowledging that Intel’s costs and revenue were out of balance, announced plans in August to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/technology/intel-layoffs-quarterly-report.html" title="">cut 15,000 jobs</a>. After a board meeting in September, he announced further belt tightening, including delaying plans for a new factory in Germany.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said that month that he still had the board of directors’ support. But Mr. Yeary’s statement suggested the board was not satisfied with Intel’s focus on making its chips more competitive with offerings from Nvidia and its longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices.</p><p>“As a board, we know first and foremost that we must put our product group at the center of all we do,” Mr. Yeary wrote. “Our customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Part of that effort will be elevating Ms. Holthaus, who rose through Intel’s sales and marketing ranks to be an executive vice president of its client computing group. She was named chief executive of Intel products as part of the changes announced Monday.</p><p>Mr. Zinsner, who will help run Intel during a transition period, was hired in January 2022 as chief financial officer after a stint at Micron Technology.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger said in the statement that the move was bittersweet. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” he added.</p><p>Shares of Intel rose about 5 percent in premarket trading, before paring back some of those gains, after the company announced Mr. Gelsinger’s retirement.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger first joined Intel in 1979, eventually ascending to become the company’s chief technology officer during his initial 30-year stint at the chipmaker. His initial tenure coincided with the era when Intel grew into the dominant supplier of chips for personal computers and, later, the server systems that power the internet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Gelsinger later left Intel, eventually leading the software maker VMware before rejoining Intel in early 2021. He vowed to restore the company’s engineering-led corporate culture that was instilled by Andy Grove, the onetime Intel chief who died in 2016.</p><p>But that culture had always bound Intel too closely to its lucrative franchise in chips for computers, making it difficult to move into new markets. Mr. Gelsinger’s style and some of his tactics also did not sit well with some Intel engineering leaders, who complained privately that he had lost touch with industry changes and put too much emphasis on building new factories rather than Intel’s products.</p><p>His crusade to create new manufacturing processes, which determine the computing power of chips, also ran into problems.</p><p>Some customers were recently informed by Intel that its most advanced manufacturing processes, which it calls 18a and 16a, were far behind TSMC, a chip industry official briefed on Intel’s progress said. TSMC is producing 30 percent of its leading-edge chips, known as 2 nanometer chips, without any flaws, while Intel’s new process produces less than 10 percent of its 18a chips without flaws, the person said.</p><p>The difference in the production quality between TSMC and Intel means that customers would have to spend more money with Intel to produce the same number of chips, so it makes more sense to choose TSMC.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Gelsinger’s turnaround plan partly hinged on the U.S. government providing financial support for its manufacturing expansion. As the Biden administration pushed the CHIPS Act, Mr. Gelsinger pledged to spend $100 billion in the next five years on U.S. manufacturing, including building <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/technology/intel-chip-factories-ohio.html" title="">two plants in Ohio</a>.</p><p>In March, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/intel-chips-biden.html" title="">Biden administration</a> made an initial commitment of $8.5 billion to support Intel’s plan in Ohio, as well as manufacturing expansions in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon. But when the government announced its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/economy/intel-chips-award-biden.html" title="">ultimate grant last week</a>, it reduced that total to $7.8 billion and said that Intel would be spending $90 billion by the end of the decade, with only one plant slated to be completed in Ohio.</p><p>Some analysts and industry experts had also questioned Mr. Gelsinger’s strategy of becoming a chip-making foundry for other companies, but keeping that business as a unit of Intel rather than spinning it off entirely.</p><p>Former Intel board members, including Reed Hundt and David Yoffie, urged the company to split into two parts — one for manufacturing chips, the other for designing them. They argued that potential chip designers that compete with Intel would shy away from using its manufacturing processes as part of a combined company.</p><p>Mr. Gelsinger had already announced plans to make Intel’s chip-making business an independent subsidiary, arguing that the time was not right for a complete spinoff. His departure suggested that the issue of how to structure Intel’s business could be reconsidered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Intel said on Monday that the leadership structure of the company’s foundry business would remain unchanged.</p><p>“Ultimately, returning to process leadership is central to product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater efficiency and improved profitability,” Mr. Yeary said.</p><p>Analysts said they were more surprised by the timing of the announcement than that Mr. Gelsinger departed. The main question, they said, is what comes next.</p><p>“There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note on Monday.</p><p>Danielle Kaye<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tripp Mickle reports on Apple and Silicon Valley for The Times and is based in San Francisco.
