    <h1>Trump Clashed With South Africa’s President</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump’s sit-down today with President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa briefly resembled Oval Office meetings of an earlier era. The leaders exchanged a handshake and cordial pleasantries. Ramaphosa even brought along a couple of pro golfers whom he knew the American leader would like.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-ramaphosa-south-africa-visit.html" title="">Trump and his aides had prepared an extraordinary ambush</a>. In front of the television cameras, the president dimmed the lights and played a video that he cited as evidence of racial persecution of white South Africans. Trump then went on to repeatedly make claims of land seizures and mass killings of white farmers in Ramaphosa’s country.</p><p>With the stunned South African president looking on, Trump flipped through printouts that he said proved his narrative: “Death, death, death,” the president said.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/afrikaner-refugees-trump-south-africa.html" title="">Trump’s claims were false</a>. Police statistics show that white South Africans are not killed at a higher rate than others in the country. South Africa approved a plan similar to eminent domain in the U.S., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-ramaphosa-south-africa-eminent-domain.html" title="">which Trump has used to take land</a>. Ramaphosa tried to gently explain the situation in South Africa to the president, but Trump was unmoved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Our White House correspondent Zolan Kanno-Youngs said it “was a stark example of a foreign leader essentially trying to give a reality check to Trump, who instead amplified fringe theories.”</p><p><strong>For context: </strong>The meeting came about a week after the Trump administration welcomed as refugees a group of white South Africans who claimed they had been persecuted in their home country. Zolan and John Eligon, our Johannesburg bureau chief, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/100000010169282/inside-trumps-exception-for-white-south-african-refugees.html" title="">explained in this video</a> what led to this moment.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics" title="">Sign up for our On Politics newsletter</a>.

For now, their flight has landed in the east African nation of Djibouti.</p><p>The judge, a Biden appointee, said the short notice was “plainly insufficient” in allowing the men an opportunity to object to their removal. In one of the strongest judicial rebukes the administration has faced, he asked for a list of names of people involved so he could notify them that they might face criminal contempt penalties.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brian O’Hara, the police chief in Minneapolis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-42a8349">Justice Dept. ended oversight of local police in several cities</h2><p>The Trump administration said today that it was planning to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/trump-police-consent-decrees.html" title="">abandon efforts to force police reforms in several cities</a>, including Minneapolis and Louisville, Ky.

The singer’s new album, “I’m the Problem,” is almost unrelentingly tragic. And it’s already on track to become one of the most commercially successful releases of the year.</p><p>The album is mostly without the playful hip-hop-informed tunes of earlier Wallen releases. Instead, a new generation of singers — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/podcasts/100000010180577/country-is-having-another-rap-moment.html" title="">you could call them Wallen’s protégés</a> — have used that framework with repeated success.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Will Matsuda for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-1d1faba">A chocolate cake with an added bonus</h2><p>Deservingly or not, vegan desserts often have a bad reputation: dry, dense and unexciting.

Her vegan chocolate cake recipe, which uses applesauce and apple cider vinegar, has fans across the country. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/climate/oregon-vegan-portland-climate.html" title="">It even helped convince my colleague Cara Buckley to commit to plant-based eating</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times.
