</span> was subbing in place of <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/48161/1hp">

</span> due to health issues. Compared to GiantX&#39;s storied experience and considerable prior LAN experience, ALG had only played three maps in the China playoffs before making it to Berlin. Ness and Smurfette in particular were happ</p>

<p>Haven was chosen by ALG and saw them open off with a pistol win. Once both teams got their full-buys, the map saw a consistent tug of war culminating in a 6-6 half. This trend continued in the second half with ALG taking a small lead at 10-9 but consecutive 3Ks from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/24101/miyori">
		Miyori	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17343/ness">
		ness	</a>
</span> saw GiantX gain the momentum to win the map 13-4. While only <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/25415/yusin">
		Yusin	</a>
</span> went positive on ALG&#39;s side, four of GiantX&#39;s players managed the same feat.</p>


<p><em>GiantX&#39;s retakes were clean.</em></p>

<p>Map two saw GiantX opt for one of their best maps and their experience on Ascent was clear to see, with a 11-1 first half. The combined efforts of Miyori and Joliinaa saw a six round win streak, and the only round that ALG won was thanks to XiMiLu taking down Miyori in a 1v1. The decision to let GiantX start on defense on Ascent was also a key factor in the map being so dominant for the European squad. That one round was all ALG would get and a 13-1 victory for GiantX saw ALG eliminated from the event. GiantX had found ten first kills across the map, compared to the four from ALG to boot. </p>


<p><em>Smurfette pops off with a crucial 3K.</em></p>

<p>For GiantX, both <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/26632/joliinaa">
		Joliinaa	</a>
</span> and Miyori had standout performances on both maps, with the former having a +20 kill differential on the Omen. While all of GiantX went positive in terms of K/D, the opposite was true for ALG. Overall, GiantX were able to consistently funnel their opponents into fights where they had advantages, and capitalized to find a win, especially on Ascent. </p>
