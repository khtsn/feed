The strike stoked fears that Israel is driving toward a full-blown war against Hezbollah.</p><p>Lebanese officials said that two apartment buildings had collapsed, killing at least 14 people and injuring at least 66 others, including children. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/20/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share" title="">Here’s the latest.</a></p><p>A spokesman for the Israeli military said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/world/middleeast/ibrahim-aqeel-hezbollah-commander-what-to-know.html?smid=url-share" title="">Ibrahim Aqeel</a> had been killed while meeting with other commanders, and that they were all underneath the building. Hezbollah confirmed Aqeel’s death. Aqeel was wanted by the U.S. in connection with two bombing attacks in 1983 that killed more than 350 people at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine Corps barracks. </p><p>The strike on the Hezbollah commanders was the latest in a series of humiliating blows to the group, coming just days after coordinated attacks blew up its pagers and walkie-talkies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elijah Nouvelage/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-76f93bef">Georgia will count ballots by hand </h2><p>Georgia’s election board today voted to force counties to hand-count all ballots cast on Election Day.

Last month, the board granted local officials new power over certifying the election, which opponents say could potentially disrupt the process if Trump loses in November.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-34ae93eb">Drug middlemen are being sued over high insulin prices </h2><p>The Federal Trade Commission said today that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/health/ftc-drug-price-inflation-insulin.html" title="">had taken legal action</a> against CVS Health’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx and their subsidiaries.</p><p>These pharmacy benefit managers have been accused of inflating insulin prices and steering patients toward higher-cost insulin products to increase their profits.

It’s one of a few decades-old diners across the city that were spared from closing by new owners. These ventures are hiring chefs who can bring modern sensibilities to the beloved restaurants, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/dining/nyc-old-school-diners-kelloggs.html" title="">ideally without losing too much of what made them special.</a></p><p>Reviving Kellogg’s might be a tough balance. It was a neighborhood institution, but that neighborhood has changed. My dad and I were regulars at Imperial Coffee House in Lower Manhattan until it shut down, and I lived around Kellogg’s for close to 20 years. Hopefully this restoration works as intended so that more New York memories can be made.</p><p>Have a revitalizing weekend.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
