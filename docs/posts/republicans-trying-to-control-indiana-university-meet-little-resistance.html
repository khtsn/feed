Faculty were downgraded to “advisory only” roles in university decision-making. Degree programs that graduated too few students would be closed.</p><p>And at Indiana University, whose flagship campus in Bloomington is ranked among the nation’s top 100 schools, the state’s governor was given new power over the school’s governing board.</p><p>The moves align with a conservative playbook to reduce faculty power on campuses perceived by many on the right as bastions of liberal thought. This year, several other Republican-led states passed laws requiring reviews for tenured faculty and the reorganization of programs at public institutions that have low enrollment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Democrats, civil liberty groups and many university presidents have responded with outrage as the Trump administration has tried to force private institutions like Harvard and Columbia to give the federal government similar powers. Harvard’s leadership sued.</p><p>At Indiana University, the president, Pamela Whitten, has stayed silent on the state’s recent moves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Indiana University’s president, Pamela Whitten, during the commencement ceremony last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeremy Hogan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Many faculty members see the Indiana bill as an attack on their university’s independence and part of an effort to restrict their own freedom to teach and speak. They read Dr. Whitten’s silence as support for the changes.</p><p>“In comparison to Harvard, the damage is very similar,” said Heather Akou, an associate professor of fashion design at Indiana University Bloomington and the incoming president-elect of the Bloomington Faculty Council.<strong> </strong>“It’s just that it’s not as public and it’s being handled mostly within the state instead of by the federal government.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Higher education leaders in other states have acted similarly.</p><p>Under pressure from the Trump administration, the University of Michigan eliminated the diversity, equity and inclusion efforts it once held up as a model. In Ohio, university leaders said little as lawmakers debated and then passed sweeping changes to higher education. The changes included prohibiting D.E.I. programs, creating a mandatory civics course and evaluating faculty members based on whether their classrooms were free of political bias.</p><p>Sometimes acquiescing has not been enough. Michigan’s former president, Santa Ono, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/santa-ono-university-of-florida-president.html" title="">lost out on his bid</a> to become the University of Florida’s new president this week, even as he had disavowed diversity programs. But Republican leaders there said his handling of pro-Palestinian unrest on Michigan’s campus showed he was not dedicated enough to the conservative agenda.</p><p>Dr. Whitten’s supporters argue that she has been a savvy leader maintaining a good relationship with Republican state leaders. Some of those leaders say she is simply protecting her vision for the institution and preventing the school from becoming a target of lawmakers’ ire.</p><p>And for some on the right, a tense relationship with faculty is not a black mark against a university leader. Todd Huston, Indiana’s House speaker, praised her in an interview as “frankly the type of change agent Indiana University needed.”</p><p>Indiana University did not make Dr. Whitten available for an interview.</p><p>In a public statement after the bill’s passage, the university said in a statement that it was working to “ensure compliance with new laws.” It added: “IU will continue to focus on its key priorities of championing student success, shaping research and innovation that improve the lives of Hoosiers, and strengthening communities across the state.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Indiana’s experience has been emblematic of the pressures facing public universities. But several factors — an active protest movement on campus, a state with strong conservative leanings and Dr. Whitten herself, a leader at odds with many on her campus — have created especially tense conditions.</p><p>The flagship campus in Bloomington, which enrolls more than 40,000 students, has historically been known for its strong arts and humanities programs.</p><p>Now, many Republican lawmakers view that focus with suspicion, seeing these fields, with their courses on race and gender, as ideologically driven. Two years ago, for example, the legislature banned public funding for the Kinsey Institute at Indiana, an internationally renowned research center devoted to human sexuality.</p><p>And when pro-Palestinian students set up an encampment on the Bloomington campus in the spring of 2024, conservatives were disturbed by how similar it felt to what was happening at Columbia, in New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pro-Palestinian students at an encampment on the Bloomington campus last spring.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeremy Hogan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Dr. Whitten’s administration acted almost immediately. The university called in the Indiana State Police, which stationed snipers on rooftops and arrested 57 people, including a handful of faculty members.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Dr. Whitten and the faculty have long had a frosty relationship. Earlier that spring, more than 800 faculty member approved a vote of no confidence in Dr. Whitten. (More than 3,000 were eligible to vote.) The aggressive response to the encampment deepened professors’ anger. The local prosecutor’s office called the arrests “constitutionally dubious” and dropped the charges.</p><p>But Dr. Whitten won plaudits from Republicans. Speaker Huston wrote a column in The Indianapolis Star praising her quick action to “maintain public order and ensure peaceful protests followed campus rules.”</p><p>Protests died down, but the discontent continued to brew.</p><p>In March 2024, the state enacted a new “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/23/us/indiana-professors-tenure-diversity.html" title="">intellectual diversity</a>” law. Dr. Whitten criticized it, saying it would put academic freedom at risk. Since then, at least two professors have been investigated over accusations that they had violated the law by making criticisms of Israel.</p><p>As the Indiana legislative session ramped up in January, the Trump administration was beginning to target universities. But higher education was not a major focus of the session in Indiana, until the changes appeared late this spring in the 220-page budget bill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>After a heated but brief debate, lawmakers approved it two days later.</p><p>“It’s not unusual for a few new things to show up in a budget bill, but for something that significant, that comprehensive, to show up all at once at the very end of the process without any hearings or opportunity for public input was pretty staggering,” said Representative Matt Pierce, a Democrat who represents Bloomington.</p><p>In the bill was a budget cut for state universities, of 5 percent over the next two years. Many on the Bloomington campus and beyond were just as upset by a provision that would remove seats on the governing board elected by alumni. The provision gave the governor full power to appoint the board, and removed a potential check on the school’s leadership. The governor has already dismissed the trustees elected by alumni.</p><p>One alumnus wrote a <a href="https://www.idsnews.com/article/2025/05/optransfer050825" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guest column</a> in the student newspaper urging students to “transfer before it’s too late.”</p><p>Now, Indiana’s public universities are scrambling to figure out which of their programs have too few graduates and must be considered for reorganization or closure. At IU Bloomington alone, dozens of degree programs, particularly in the humanities, could be affected, according to an Indiana administrator.</p><p>The legislation reflects a broader trend as Republican state leaders argue that public colleges need to offer taxpayers better returns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“There’s this shifting mentality that the state is the owner of these institutions — it’s not the students, it’s not the alumni,” said Isabel McMullen, a doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies public university boards.</p><p>Benjamin Robinson, a professor of Germanic studies at IU Bloomington, who was arrested during a pro-Palestinian demonstration in the spring of 2024, said the new laws had scared and frustrated faculty members, and left them feeling unsupported by their administrators.</p><p>He is now separately facing an investigation for violating the intellectual diversity law, after he was accused of talking negatively about the state of Israel.</p><p>“What she seems to have delivered up to the legislature is the autonomy of the institution,” he said of Dr. Whitten.</p><p>Dr. Whitten’s supporters say many faculty members simply don’t understand the need for transformation. “Change is not always well received,” Speaker Huston said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Unlike some of her peers, Dr. Whitten’s position seems secure. This year, the board of trustees voted to raise her salary to $900,000 from about $700,000. And they <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2025/02/20/iu-president-pam-whitten-gets-raise-and-contract-extension/79339794007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extended her contract</a> by five years, without waiting for the results of a tenure review scheduled for next year.</p><p>The only dissenting trustee was elected by alumni. But the governor has already removed that person from the board.</p><p>Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabelle Taft is a reporter covering national news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
