The plan calls for a target of military spending at 3.5 percent of their gross domestic product, plus another 1.5 percent for newer, nontraditional “defense-related” spending by 2032, officials said.</p><p>The latter could include building or improving rail lines and bridges to withstand the weight of military convoys, strengthening cybersecurity or developing advanced technology for weaponry and communications. Some member nations are open to shouldering more of their collective costs, alarmed by Mr. Trump’s threats to weaken American support for European security if they don’t.</p><p>“We have to make sure that we have all the enablers in place, everything related to defense spending in place,” the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_235107.htm?selectedLocale=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last week</a> after meeting with the alliance’s foreign ministers in Turkey, where countries agreed to the 5 percent plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Sometimes when you cross a bridge in Europe, you hope with your own car that you safely get across it — let alone with a tank,” he added.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Rutte, NATO’s secretary general, speaking in Turkey last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Rutte came up with the approach to meeting the spending goal, according to a NATO country’s foreign minister and a European diplomat. It combines what many experts think: European countries must spend on hard military power to take responsibility for conventional deterrence while meeting Mr. Trump’s demand.</p><p>Germany’s newly appointed foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said in Turkey that his government backs Mr. Rutte’s proposal. His French counterpart, Jean-Noël Barrot, said that a “3 percent to 3.5 percent target is right,” but hinted at backing the broader plan in remarks to reporters.</p><p>The new approach reflects allied governments’ efforts to win over Mr. Trump, or at least show him they are making progress on his appeals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It is also an acknowledgment that NATO members’ current pledge, to spend 2 percent of G.D.P. on the military, is too little to sustain the alliance against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the first full-scale land war in Europe since World War II. Some member states have yet to meet even that commitment.</p><p>NATO spending is expected to be the focus of an annual summit meeting scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague, in Mr. Rutte’s native Netherlands. Already, it has stirred considerable debate within the alliance, and officials are trying to reach a consensus on spending goals before the summit begins, said Radmila Shekerinska, NATO’s new deputy secretary general.</p><p>While Mr. Trump’s schedule is not finalized, he is expected to attend the summit meeting.</p><p>In the latest official figures, <a href="https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">23 of NATO’s 32 member states</a> meet or surpass the current 2 percent threshold. The Trump administration appears to be open to allies broadening how they invest in defense spending, so long as the total reaches 5 percent.</p><p>“It is definitely more than just missiles, tanks, and howitzers,” Matthew G. Whitaker, the new American ambassador to NATO, <a href="https://www.state.gov/digital-press-briefing-u-s-permanent-representative-to-nato-ambassador-matthew-whitaker/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last week</a>. “But at the same time, it’s got to be defense-related. It’s not a grab-bag for everything.”</p><p>At the Lennart Meri security conference in Estonia last weekend, Mr. Whitaker said that the United States would also commit to the same spending goal of 5 percent, though that amount is much larger than for other NATO countries. The United States spends <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/article/the-united-states-spends-more-on-defense-than-the-next-9-countries-combined/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly $1 trillion</a> on global military operations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Increasing the overall spending threshold to 5 percent would bring NATO’s collective defense spending to $2.4 trillion, with the United States still paying more than half, <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/trumps-five-percent-doctrine-and-nato-defense-spending" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a recent estimate</a> by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Spanish Navy saluting each other during NATO exercises in the Atlantic in March.

But the new spending commitment would require significant investment from laggards like Italy, Portugal and Spain, and put more pressure on key countries with already high budget deficits, like France and Britain.</p><p>Some states, like <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2025/04/estonia-approves-3-2b-defense-spending-spike-locks-in-5-4-percent-gdp-target/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baltic nations</a> that border Russia, have already planned to spend at least 5 percent of their gross national product on traditional military costs like personnel, weapons and military operations, including exercises, by the end of the decade. Estonia plans on surpassing that goal <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/26/estonian-government-approves-additional-funding-to-raise-defence-spending-to-54-of-gdp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 2026</a>.

But Italy does not yet count certain technologies that could be put to military use strictly as defense spending, said Roberto Cingolani, the chief executive of the Italian defense firm Leonardo.</p><p>If they were, he predicted the percentage of Italy’s defense expenditures could quickly rise.</p><p>Advanced technology, like artificial intelligence and cloud computing, are “becoming the new backbone of defense,” Mr. Cingolani said in a recent interview. “It’s not just bullets — it’s bullets and bytes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“The target of NATO member countries must be 5 percent in the future,” Estonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said at the meeting last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Experts said Mr. Trump’s demands also created an incentive for Europe to finally break through funding and bureaucratic hurdles to address another vulnerability: upgrading key transit routes for any rapid deployment of troops and weapons.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The war in Ukraine has highlighted Europe’s shortcomings in such logistical preparedness.
