                  <p>A slow debut in the online portion of Bounty gave way to an IEM Krakow recovery, where <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/20968/soulfly" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1496247552">soulfly</a> showed a better face in his transition from aggressive to supportive roles, even though it ended with a whimper as it so often did for <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid79378800">Aurora</a> in playoffs in the past.</p>

                  <p>&#34;We showed good things. We showed also the same mistakes, the same things we had last year in the playoffs, so we tried to fix that mentally, but also we have to understand it was soulfly&#39;s first LAN tournament in six years,&#34; he told HLTV.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I feel like we are in a good way, but sometimes I feel like we are not in the same shape we had last year individually,&#34; he went on.</p>
                  <p>In Cluj-Napoca, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid79378800">Aurora</a> are 1-1 after opening the tournament with a loss to <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1866687773">FUT</a> and coming back in round 2 with a win over <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/4773/pain" data-tooltip-id="uid115904049">paiN</a>.</p>

                  <p>They&#39;re not the first team to suffer at the hands of the former <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/10371/navi-junior" data-tooltip-id="uid939291382">NAVI Junior</a> squad, who have quickly risen up the ranks with a promising showing in Krakow, and <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/150/maj3r" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1854862582">MAJ3R</a> attributed that success to their immense firepower.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I think their in-game leader is good, lurking a lot and putting a lot of firepower on the other side, and he&#39;s offering a lot of B plans,&#34; he gave props to <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/22203/krabeni" data-tooltip-id="uid762633305">Aulon <span>&#34;⁠Krabeni⁠&#34;</span> Fazlija</a>. &#34;But I think the biggest strength they have is the firepower they have.

                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>It was a surprisingly competitive game out of a paiN that has just come into the new season fresh off changes. Can you tell me about it? What was challenging about it?</strong></p>
                  <p>Nuke was not a good map for us today, but after that I think we played good Counter-Strike on Dust2 and Anubis, and congrats to them, yeah.</p>
                  <p><strong>You came into the season fresh off a change, bringing in soulfly to replace jottAAA. How has the season gone so far after this change? Do you feel like you are on the right track to make that replacement work?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think that we are on the right track because in the last tournament in Krakow we showed good things. We showed also the same mistakes, the same things that we had last year in the playoffs, so we tried to fix that mentally, but also we have to understand that it is soulfly&#39;s first LAN tournament in six years, even in playoffs in front of the crowd. It&#39;s also an experience for him.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>My strategy as an in-game leader in this team is to make XANTARES and Wicadia play late-rounds</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>But I think we are on a good track because I try to play more intelligently on the CT side, making more gambles, and on T side I try to make us play better Counter-Strike overall. I feel like we are in a good way, but sometimes I feel like, individually, we are not in the same shape we had last year. Individually, my players are not the same, even me, but not in Krakow, I think in Krakow I played well, but now in this tournament I&#39;m also not good. But if we can fix the individual [form] and if we keep working, hopefully we can achieve what want.</p>
                  <p><strong>It was a tough run, you played four top-five teams, so he got about as tested as he could possibly have, but he came out of it with a couple of really strong games in the group stage to help get you guys through to the playoffs. Before that, he was struggling a bit with adapting to the new roles. Is it reassuring that he&#39;s adapting to these roles well?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah. I feel like we are on a good track, also for him because, yeah, the first tournament was not every good, but in Krakow, I think he had a negative rating in Stage 1, and then he went to Stage 2, he put up a 1.20, he was the best player in my team.</p>
                  <p>I think it&#39;s a good thing for him, if he can play very good Counter-Strike and he can show this level against very good opponents, it&#39;s very good signs for us. Our objective is obviously to be top-five, but we feel that we still have the same mistakes that we were making last year, so we work and try to fix that for the next tournament.</p>

                  <p><strong>What have been your biggest points of feedback to him about adapting to these roles and what you&#39;re looking to get out of him in these roles?</strong></p>
                  <p>On FireFlux, he was playing more of an aggressive role, taking some zones, but here there is XANTARES and Wicadia. My goal, to be honest, my strategy as an in-game leader in this team is to make XANTARES and Wicadia play late-rounds, more in the clutch. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking soulfly sometimes, in set tactics, to go first so that my star players can play clutch. It&#39;s important, I think, for them.</p>
                  <p>We are a team and we all sacrifice for that, and soulfly is also very willing to do that. He&#39;s not like, &#39;Oh, MAJ3R, I don&#39;t want to do it.&#39; He&#39;s doing everything for the team, and I want to thank him for that. The strategy is that, it&#39;s 50-50, he changed some roles since FireFlux, and here he has to adapt. For now, I think he&#39;s adapting well, and hopefully it can be better in the future.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>Krabeni is good, lurking a lot and putting a lot of firepower on the other side</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>I remember you were complaining about the previous couple of map changes, Valve always removing the maps you&#39;ve been good on. Obviously, now you&#39;re getting one back in Anubis. How good is that for the team?</strong></p>
                  <p>It&#39;s very good. We feel very confident on Anubis, not only as a team, but individually all the players really like the map, and it&#39;s helped a lot. We really like the map and, obviously, I&#39;m very happy that it&#39;s come back. We can show that, I think we played it four times since it came back, and we have four wins, so it&#39;s very good for us to have Anubis back, to be honest.</p>
                  <p><strong>You played FUT earlier. They have been on a quick rise and surprised everyone with how competitive they can be with how young and inexperienced they are. What do you think makes them a scary team?</strong></p>
                  <p>Bro, I think the gamestyle is very good in Counter-Strike. I think their in-game leader is good, lurking a lot and putting a lot of firepower on the other side, and he&#39;s offering a lot of B plans.</p>
                  <p>But I think the biggest strength they have is the firepower they have, aim-wise, of all five people. It&#39;s very good. When I play Spirit or Vitality or I play Falcons, FUT are shooting better than all these teams. Yesterday, they really shoot better than every opponent I&#39;ve played right now, so really congrats to them, but hopefully, next time we can get our revenge.</p>
