The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive intelligence operation, confirmed the details of the assassination given by Russia.</p><p>The S.B.U. considered General Kirillov a legitimate target, the official said.</p><p>A day before his killing, the S.B.U. had charged General Kirillov in absentia, saying he was responsible for the “massive use of banned chemical weapons” in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The division he oversaw carries out specialized tasks, including protecting Russian troops when chemical and nuclear weapons are used.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene of the explosion in Moscow on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxim Shemetov/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>General Kirillov was also a player in Russia’s propaganda campaign against Ukraine and the West, frequently addressing the news media with unfounded claims. In 2023, for instance, he <a href="https://ria.ru/20230619/biooruzhie-1879093322.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that</a> the United States was planning to use drones “designed to spread infected mosquitoes.”</p><p>General Kirillov <a href="https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/21306349" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also claimed</a> that Russian forces had uncovered a chemical weapons production laboratory near Avdiivka, a Ukrainian city that Moscow’s troops captured in February.</p><p>On Tuesday, the RIA Novosti state news agency published a photograph of what it said was a bomb-disposal robot operating outside a brick building in Moscow. The agency reported that the explosion occurred at about 6:12 a.m. and was so powerful that it damaged windows as far up as the third floor and shattered them in a building across the street.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>General Kirillov was the head of Russia’s radioactive, chemical and biological defense forces. He helped develop a thermobaric rocket launcher, the TOS-2, according to a biography published by RIA Novosti. The Russian military frequently reports its use in Ukraine.</p><p>Dmitri Medvedev, a former president and deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, on Tuesday blamed Kyiv for the killing, pledging “inevitable retaliation” against “military and political leadership of Ukraine.”</p><p>By assassinating General Kirillov, the Ukrainian government is trying to “drag out the war and killing” in Ukraine, Mr. Medvedev said in a statement issued by the security council, <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22691857" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Tass.</a></p><p>The killing of General Kirillov was the highest-profile apparent assassination of a Russian military official far from the battlefield since the start of the invasion in 2022. While other Russian generals have died in occupied Ukraine or near the front line, he is the highest-ranking military official to have been killed inside Russia.</p><p>Several previous targeted killings in Russia have been tied to Ukraine, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/ukraine-russia-dugina-assassination.html" title="">a car-bomb attack near Moscow</a> that killed the daughter of a prominent nationalist in October 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Outnumbered on the battlefield, where it is steadily losing ground under relentless Russian assaults, Ukraine has regularly engaged in unconventional warfare that include acts of sabotage and suspected assassinations of Russian officials, like local administrators in the occupied territories of Ukraine.</p><p>The S.B.U. said that Russian forces had used chemical weapons on the battlefield more than 4,800 times since the war began, on General Kirillov’s orders. Russia <a href="https://www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2024/07/ec106nat06%28e%29.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied the accusations</a> during a July meeting of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</p><p>Ukraine has said the chemical weapons used by Russia often include combat grenades equipped with the irritant chemical agents CS and CN. These tear gases, most commonly used by riot police officers to control crowds, are banned in warfare under the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries, including Russia.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/world/europe/us-russia-chemical-weapons-ukraine.html" title="">The U.S. State Department said this spring</a> that Russia had used chloropicrin, a choking agent widely used in World War I, as well as tear gas on the battlefield. Britain also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-sanctions-russian-troops-deploying-chemical-weapons-on-the-battlefield" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imposed sanctions on General Kirillov</a> this fall for his responsibility in deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine.</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv, and <!-- -->Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> from Istanbul.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
