</span> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498627/paper-rex-vs-wolves-esports-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubf" target="_blank">2-0 in the upper bracket finals</a> of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">VCT 2025 Masters: Toronto</a>, earning their third international grand finals appearance. The first map of the series was a nailbiter, but the second was a stomp in favor of the last Pacific team in Toronto.</p>

<p>The series started on Lotus, with Paper Rex running double Duelist with Vyse to fight the double Controller from Wolves. <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11218/yuicaw">
		Yuicaw	</a>
</span> got three and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7849/siufatbb">
		SiuFatBB	</a>
</span> got two to win the first pistol, and barely converted their anti-eco: a round they have struggled to convert all event long. Wolves were unable to convert the bonus round, and Paper Rex nearly capitalized to tie the game early. Yet, Wolves recovered a 5v3 to add to their lead.</p>

<p>Paper Rex was able to claw some rounds back thanks to some questionable decision-making from Wolves, especially with their ultimates. The rounds were tense, but Wolves decided to play slower rounds to bait Paper Rex into their trademark aggression. It did lead to some very worrying ends to rounds, but Wolves did finish them on top. SiuFatBB clutched another round to add to his library of clutches at Masters Toronto, and Wolves entered halftime up 7-5. </p>

<p>The second half started with <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9803/d4v41">
		d4v41	</a>
</span> quickly snapping the heads off three Wolves players, flawlessly winning the pistol. Paper Rex nearly lost the anti-eco, just like Wolves almost did in the first half, but were able to convert the bonus thanks to a Judge triple kill from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7378/jinggg">
		Jinggg	</a>
</span>. Wolves lost the lead quickly, and d4v41 got a gem of an ace to keep the momentum going.</p>

<p><em>d4v41 gets an ace to win a big round for Paper Rex against Wolves.</em></p>

<p>Even as Paper Rex got the lead for the first time in the game, Wolves have been a team that thrives on comebacks and making momentum out of nothing. The team flooded flawlessly on A Site, then Yuicaw outsmarted Paper Rex with an anti-teleport setup on C Site, tying the game again at 9-9. Just as Wolves needed another hero, <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7426/juicy">
		Juicy	</a>
</span> got three to retake the lead. That was when the rounds traded back and forth, staying tied late into the map and going to overtime.</p>

<p>Paper Rex showed off their stalwart B Site hold to start overtime ahead, and Wolves crumbled after going up 3v2 to lose map one in overtime 14-12.</p>

<p>The next map was Ascent: Wolves&#39; map pick. The final team from China had to show resilience between maps, considering they hadn&#39;t lost a map since the Swiss stage against Sentinels. Paper Rex decided to change their Ascent composition for this match, reverting to the standard Ascent comp with Jett and KAY/O. Wolves ran their double Sentinel with <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/37489/lysoar">
		Lysoar	</a>
</span> on Deadlock, and SiuFatBB led his team to a pistol win.</p>

<p>For once, Wolves had a flawless anti-eco round and were able to convert their bonus off some heroism from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/14125/spring">
		Spring	</a>
</span>, who took B Site cleanly with Lysoar late into the round. It could&#39;ve been an amazing start, but Paper Rex were quick to eco Wolves off another star moment from d4v41. <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13744/patmen">
		PatMen	</a>
</span> got a four-kill clutch to get Paper Rex another round win on defense, to shake some of the confidence from Wolves.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lzP34BPZeSM?si=shHEGl_aRGqIOYr-&amp;clip=Ugkxtlc81pSIf36Pc3_uFcxVZ__atDt0OKco&amp;clipt=EIOJ_gMYy5L_Aw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>PatMen flanks to get four against Wolves.</em></p>

<p>Wolves went from 3-0 up to tied 4-4, and the tides of the map shifted back to Paper Rex. They won seven rounds in a row to lead the half 8-4, and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9801/f0rsaken">
		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span> led Paper Rex to a pistol win to extend that streak. Wolves had to win the bonus, and they did, but Paper Rex won the round after to take an 11-5 lead. That meant Wolves had to do another comeback like their game against Gen.G, but it was not meant to be. Paper Rex dominantly closed out Ascent 13-8 and swept Wolves for their second loss in the tournament.</p>

<p>A lot of Paper Rex players ended with great stats, but f0rsakeN was the best player when the series concluded, with a series rating of 1.31, 40 kills, and a lobby-leading 239 ACS.</p>

<p>With this win, Paper Rex secures another <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498628/paper-rex-vs-tbd-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-gf" target="_blank">grand finals</a> appearance, this time through the upper bracket at Masters Toronto, earning the map ban advantage over whichever team makes it through the lower bracket. As for Wolves, they will face the victor of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498633/g2-esports-vs-fnatic-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-lr3" target="_blank">Fnatic versus G2 Esports</a> in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498634/wolves-esports-vs-tbd-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-lbf" target="_blank">the lower bracket final</a>, for another attempt to defeat Paper Rex and earn an international title.</p>
