			<p>I wonder if that will be badly perceived by Riot.</p>
<p>I mean, LEV is one of the two teams that represent Latam (not including BR teams) and they have an almost complete NA roster. Next year will be the end of the 4 year contract that T1 teams have.</p>
<p>I wonder if Riot won&#39;t renew with them due to that and favor another LATAM org such as 9Z, FSN, AK, etc.</p>		</div>

		<div>
			
			<p>I hope it is badly perceived, last year at least 3/5 players were South American (kingg, mazino, aspas), but now its only kingg and not even the coaching staff has a singular Latin American.</p>
<p>Really sad that KRU is the only LATAM representative, and if they lose and dont qualify, an entire region will almost always have no one to cheer for from their region. At least KRU somehow always goes on a run and qualifies to Champions.</p>		</div>

		<p>I mean if they didn&#39;t do anything about it in League of Legends, doubt they&#39;ll enforce anything for Valorant. Not big enough game or funding to care IMO. We&#39;ll see though. it&#39;s almost the same thing as FPX getting an all EU roster then changed back to CN. </p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4646109">
		
		
		<div>
			
			<p>The thing with FPX was that the chinese org had a team based in Europe and participated in the EMEA during the time when there was an open qualifier.</p>
<p>After the franchises were stablished, the whole EU roster was dropped (later they were mostly taken by NAVI, iirc), and they took the chinese one to participate in that region.</p>
<p>Somethig similar happened with G2 and NiP. G2 dropped the EU roster and went with a NA one (mostly The Guard), while NiP went to BR.</p>
<p>LEV has only 2 members that are from their region (1 player and their manager) while they are supposed to represent LATAM (I know that the rest of the or is mostly latinoamerican, but they are not usually seen/talked about when refering to a team</p>
<p>I won&#39;t comment on the LoL part as I don&#39;t follow that competitive scene, but I would appreciate the context if it doesn&#39;t bother you.</p>		</div>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4646406">
		
		
		<p>Yeah so in League of Legends pro scene. I don&#39;t know how much has changed, but before. they only allowed like X amount of &#34;imports&#34; aka players not from said region. So example if you were in NA LCS, your team would need 2 NA residents, and can hire up to 3 non-Residents. So that&#39;s how they were able to control an Org from having a team full of EU or Pacific players in NA. But because Valorant is still very new in comparison, my gut is that they will not pour more resources to add rules and regulations like that until it brings in more money. They still lack a replay system, and haven&#39;t introduced any banning for agents, so lot to expand on in the future.</p>

			<p>Would be nice, but the main reason we don&#39;t see rosters stay together longer is the ridiculously long off season combined with a busy (and relatively short) active season for competitive.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t get that many shots to make it very far, let alone in actually making it to international events.</p>
<p>Looking at CS for comparison, they have 1 month off seasons 2-3 times per year, wayyy more tournaments (actually LANs with teams from multiple countries), and we&#39;re not even talking about what the actual majors look like.</p>
<p>Tl;dr Riot&#39;s structuring of the competitive scene is what necessitates cut-throat roster decisions. If they added a policy to deter orgs from making roster decisions, the irony would be pretty apparent.</p>		</div>

			<p>L move. Mark my words this will be another trophyless season for Lev even though they have C0m and demon1, I would be surprised they even make it out of group stages at an international let alone making it to an international. </p>
<p>Weird how so many people on vlr are so high on rossy when he hasn&#39;t accomplished anything in this game despite being in the scene for the last 3+ years. </p>		</div>

			<p>honestly i think people are hype of rossy because he got booted out of c9 when playing well and everyone thinks want him to prove c9 wrong</p>
<p>but your right though he didn&#39;t really have any standout performance or appearances apart from his time on t1 where he played ok</p>		</div>

		<p>I think this helps the team a lot, and it&#39;s great that since leviatan has been comming in english for a while now, they can just select the players they want from anywhere in the world. In general i am mainly happy for Rossy as he did not have the easiest of roads lately and i hope he takes this opportunity and shows what he&#39;s made off. </p>
