Austin III called his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Mr. Austin “stressed the importance of finding a path to a diplomatic solution that will allow residents on both sides of the border to return to their homes as quickly and safely as possible, as well as reaching a Gaza cease-fire deal that will bring all the hostages home,” the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3914549/pentagon-press-secretary-maj-gen-pat-ryder-holds-an-off-camera-on-the-record-pr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pentagon said in a statement</a> on Monday.</p><p>“The secretary made clear that the United States remains postured to protect U.S. forces and personnel and determined to deter any regional actors from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict,” the statement said.</p><p>About 40,000 American troops are stationed in the region on bases in Iraq, in Syria and in the Persian Gulf countries. The U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln is in the Gulf of Oman, and a second aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, left Norfolk, Va., on Monday for the Mediterranean as part of a regularly scheduled deployment.</p><p>Tensions have significantly escalated this week between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia supported by Iran. Back-and-forth attacks have brought the two sides to the brink of their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/world/africa/30iht-mideast.4.9621692.html" title="">first full-scale war since 2006</a>, when they fought a 34-day conflict that involved an Israeli ground invasion and the deaths of over 1,000 Lebanese and 150 Israelis.</p><p>In recent days, Israel has carried out a series of attacks on Hezbollah targets, raising concern in the Biden administration that retaliatory strikes by the group or its patron, Iran, could endanger U.S. troops in the region.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Helene Cooper is a Pentagon correspondent.
