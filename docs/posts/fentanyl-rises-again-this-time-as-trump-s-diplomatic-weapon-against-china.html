    <h1>Fentanyl Rises Again, This Time as Trump’s Diplomatic Weapon Against China</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite the recent momentum, <a href="https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/no-china-isnt-really-suppressing-its-production-of-fentanyl-precursors/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experts have warned</a> that much still needed to be done. Chinese producers of fentanyl ingredients, which are also used to produce legal pharmaceutical drugs, can circumvent laws by developing new uncontrolled precursor chemicals. Experts at the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/what-chinas-role-combating-illegal-fentanyl-trade" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Council on Foreign Relations</a> say that Chinese and U.S. law enforcement officials need to work together more closely, and that China needs to provide the United States with more support in anti-money laundering efforts to block the flow of illicit money funding the trade.</p><p>Some analysts were concerned that tariffs might hurt that effort more than help it.</p><p>“An imposition of tariffs is not going to do anything regarding the flow of fentanyl,” said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert on global drug policy. “In fact, it might undermine the counternarcotics cooperation that the U.S. and China have been doing in 2024 and that came after no cooperation for over two years.”</p><p>Chinese officials have tended to use the fentanyl issue as leverage over the United States, cooperating only when they receive something in return.</p><p>To restart talks on narcotics after Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi met in California, Washington agreed to Beijing’s demand that U.S. sanctions be lifted on a forensics institute run by China’s Ministry of Public Security. The institute was placed on a trade blacklist in 2020 because it was linked to abuses against ethnic minorities in China, particularly the Uyghurs. The Biden administration said the move was justified because China had shut down some companies exporting fentanyl precursors and closed their bank accounts.</p><p>“If the United States wants to get more cooperation from China on the domestic fentanyl issue, it should seek China’s support in a constructive way instead of using unilateral, punitive measures to force China to make concessions,” said Song Guoyou, an American studies expert at Fudan University in Shanghai.</p></div></div>
