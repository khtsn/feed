Regulators said the app service would resume after they had ensured it complied with South Korea’s laws on protecting personal information.</p><p>The Chinese chatbot has topped the charts of most downloaded apps around the world since its release last month. The app is powered by an A.I. system whose performance rivals top products made by American companies and was built, DeepSeek said, for a fraction of their cost.</p><p>DeepSeek’s claims that it built its technology with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/deepseek-china-ai-chips.html" title="">far fewer expensive computer chips</a> than companies typically use sent U.S. tech stocks tumbling last month and provoked a debate over whether Washington has failed in its attempts to block China’s access to such chips.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>DeepSeek’s success has thrust the little-known company, which is backed by a stock trading firm, into the spotlight. In China, DeepSeek has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/business/deepseek-china-reaction.html" title="">heralded as a hero</a> of the country’s tech industry. The company’s founder, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/deepseek-china-liang-wenfeng.html" title="">Liang Wenfeng</a>, met China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, along with other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/business/china-xi-jinping-jack-ma.html" title="">tech executives on Monday</a>.</p><p>But outside China, the app’s popularity has worried regulators over DeepSeek’s security, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/world/asia/deepseek-china-censorship.html" title="">censorship</a> and management of sensitive data.</p><p>The app had become one of South Korea’s most popular downloads in the artificial intelligence category. Earlier this month, South Korea directed many government employees not to use DeepSeek products on official devices.</p><p>Government agencies in Taiwan and Australia have also told workers not to use DeepSeek’s products, over security concerns.</p><p>South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Commission said it had identified problems with how the app processes personal information, adding that it decided “it would inevitably take a considerable amount of time to correct” them. To address these concerns, DeepSeek had appointed an agent in South Korea last week, the regulator said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Chinese government has always required Chinese companies to conduct overseas operations in strict compliance with local laws and regulations, Guo Jiakun, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said at a briefing on Monday.</p><p>“We also hope that relevant countries will avoid taking the approach of generalizing and politicizing economic, trade and technological issues,” Mr. Guo said.</p><p>Li You<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/meaghan-tobin">More about Meaghan Tobin</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Coverage of Artificial Intelligence</h2><hr/><p><strong>News</strong><strong> and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p>Vice President JD Vance told European and Asian leaders in Paris that the Trump administration was adopting an aggressive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/vance-speech-paris-ai-summit.html">America First approach</a> to the race to dominate all the building blocks of artificial intelligence.</p></li><li><p>President Emmanuel Macron of France pitched lighter regulation to fuel an A.I. boom in Europe, but attendees at a summit in Paris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/ai-summit-paris.html">worry</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/ai-summit-paris.html"> that the risks of A.I. will be overlooked</a> as the continent rushes to keep up with the United States and China.</p></li><li><p>An apparent breakthrough in efficiency from the Chinese start-up DeepSeek did not make tech’s biggest companies question their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/technology/deepseek-data-centers-ai.html">extravagant spending on new A.I. data centers</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>The Age of A.I.</strong></p><ul><li><p>DeepSeek, a Chinese start-up, built one of the most powerful A.I. systems using far fewer computer chips than many experts thought possible. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/technology/deepseek-ai-chip-costs.html">Here’s a guide to how it succeeded</a>.</p></li><li><p>Most large employers play down the likelihood that A.I. bots will take our jobs. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/business/klarna-ceo-ai.html">Then there’s Klarna</a>, a darling of tech investors.</p></li><li><p>Religious leaders are experimenting with A.I. in their work, spurring an industry of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/technology/ai-religious-leaders.html">faith-based tech companies that offer A.I. tools</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
