Harrison, counsel for Los Angeles County, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The official cause of the Eaton fire remains under investigation by the State Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p><p>An Edison spokeswoman, Kathleen Dunleavy, said the utility had been reviewing the lawsuits and would respond to the complaints in court.</p><p>“Our hearts continue to be with the communities affected by the wildfires,” Ms. Dunleavy said.</p><p>In its lawsuit, Los Angeles County said videos, eyewitness accounts and other evidence made clear that Edison equipment caused the Eaton fire on Jan. 7. Preliminary reviews by fire investigators placed the origin of the fire in Eaton Canyon, where Edison maintains four active and three inactive transmission lines.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/us/los-angeles-eaton-fire-cause.html" title="">gas station video</a> that appeared to show the beginnings of the fire and data that suggest there were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/29/business/energy-environment/eaton-fire-electrical-faults-southern-california-edison.html" title="">electrical faults</a> on Edison’s transmission system, both of which were first reported by The New York Times, prompted the utility to expand its own investigation into the cause of the fire.</p><p>In a letter to state regulators, the utility said it was examining the available evidence and equipment to determine if its equipment might have been involved in starting the fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Edison also noted in the letter that there might be a connection between its equipment and another fire that started the same day, the Hurst fire in Sylmar.</p><p>The Eaton and Hurst fires were among several blazes that burned across the Los Angeles area in January as a storm ripped through Southern California with winds reaching as high as 100 m.p.h. In addition to the Eaton fire, 12 people died in the Palisades fire, which devastated the coastal neighborhood of Pacific Palisades.</p><p>The Palisades fire also remains under investigation.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Penn is a reporter based in Los Angeles and covers the energy industry.
