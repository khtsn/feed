Yet, if ever there was an occasion to introduce them, it was draft night.</p><p>In recent years the N.F.L. draft has mutated from an annual ritual with all the theatrics of a plumber’s convention, to a runway show for the freakishly fit.</p><p>It’s now taken on a new dimension in the post-N.I.L. era (referring to name, image, likeness, the 2021 change in N.C.A.A. policy that allowed college athletes to earn money). To watch the N.F.L. draft now is to detect just how adept these barely-20-somethings are at personal branding. If Deion Sanders (whose son Shedeur became the story of the night, falling out of the first round, well below his projection) was ahead of his time when he was drafted in 1989, challenging the league’s conservatism by wearing blocky sunglasses and several gold chains, that look-at-me tendency is all too pervasive now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Today, college players that ascend to the N.F.L. enter the league with an acute understanding of themselves not just as players, but as brands — with all the promotional value that comes along from that.</p><p>“Every player is now realizing and learning that they’re their own big machine,” said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/style/nfl-fashion-editor-kyle-smith.html" title="">Kyle Smith</a>, the N.F.L.’s fashion editor, who helps the league and its players build relationships in the fashion industry. For top prospects, Mr. Smith said the draft “is the first time that the public really gets to see them and obviously they use fashion to express who they are.”</p><p>Often, that expression came through literally: Matthew Golden, who went to the Green Bay Packers with the 23rd pick, was Mr. Midas in a golden “G” necklace and a rococo-gilded suit as abashed as Versailles wallpaper. As he told a reporter from GQ, “My last name Golden, it just made too much sense to me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Matthew Golden’s medallion was a reference to his name, but it worked out well when he was selected by the Green Bay Packers. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Kaufman/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>There was a “read my chest” theme emanating from the many players who brandished Hershey’s-bar-scaled gold chains etched with their nicknames. If nothing else, the pirate’s bounty of gold at the draft reflected the staggering amount of money sloshing around the college ranks, likely shepherded by the N.I.L. adjustments.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The evening’s self-marketing maestro was Shemar Stewart, who went to the Cincinnati Bengals with the 17th pick and wore not only a snowball-sized chain depicting an irate gorilla, but custom smoking slippers with the same menacing simian logo. A quick Google reveals that same emblem sitting at the top of his website: It is evidently never too early for a defensive end to mint his own Jordan-like logo in today’s N.F.L. If Mr. Stewart works out in Cincinnati, expect to see much more of that logo.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shemar Stewart’s outfit included a chain with a logo for his personal brand. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stacy Revere/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Occasionally, something more personal peeked through amid all this cocksure branding. There was something touching about Tetairoa McMillan, the Hawaiian wide receiver who went to the Carolina Panthers with the eighth pick, tossing a lei over his Joker purple suit. Will Johnson, one of just two players invited to attend the draft in person who did not get selected in the first round, showed off a ring made by his mother that he said contained the names of his deceased family members.</p><p>Within the cavalcade of tailored suits, Abdul Carter, who ended up being selected by the New York Giants with the third pick, stood out in his obsidian thobe, a traditional ankle-length garment. “Just paying homage to my religion,” Mr. Carter told a reporter on the carpet. “I wouldn’t be here without being a Muslim.” (Though it was his father’s oversized Adidas chain that really went viral online later in the night. The younger Mr. Carter has already landed a deal with the German sportswear company.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Will Johnson, who was not selected in the first round, let his N.C.A.A. championship ring provide the sparkle for his outfit on the first day of the draft.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joshua Applegate/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tetairoa McMillan, a Hawaiian wide receiver, wore a lei on top of his suit.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kirby Lee/Imagn Images, via Imagn Images, via Reuters Connect</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The night though was conspicuously light on big luxury brands Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton, a signal that the globe-stomping industry remains oddly bearish on the N.F.L.’s marketing potential. Instead, the name mentioned most during the N.F.L.’s red carpet coverage was Brian Alexander, a Washington, D.C., tailor who has found his niche producing custom suits for football players, but who doesn’t have much of a profile beyond the sporting world.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Some brands are really waking up,” said Mr. Smith. “Some brands, you know, take a little bit more time.”</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cam Ward, the first overall pick, was understated compared to his fellow first round picks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joshua Applegate/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Travis Hunter, the second overall pick, intentionally picked a suit color that would not provide hints about where he was headed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Kaufman/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Alexander is then at least partially responsible for the amount of achingly shrunken suits that hit the stage on Thursday. The fear of stumbling back into tarp-sized suits, a la say, Eli Manning at the 2004 draft, has players parking themselves too far in the other direction. And if fulsome pants are returning to fashion, that message certainly didn’t reach the draft, where bare ankles remained the norm.</p><p>There were also suits of shocking colors. The jolt from one of them was delivered by Travis Hunter, a player who hopes to break convention by playing offense and defense in the N.F.L. He tore onto the carpet in the exact shade of a Pepto Bismol bottle and told an interviewer before the draft that he didn’t want to pick a hue that might’ve hinted at his eventual destination later in the evening. The Heisman Trophy-winner was selected second overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars, his flamingo jacket pairing well with the teal brim of the team’s cap.</p><p>The strongest message of the night, though, was one made by doing the least. Cam Ward, the quarterback who, as predicted, was selected by the Tennessee Titans with the first overall pick, entered Lambeau Field humbly in a tan, single breasted suit with a white T-shirt underneath and a slight chain around his neck.</p><p>When you go first, who cares what you wear?</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacob Gallagher is a Times reporter covering fashion and style.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
