From her house outside Hartford, Conn., she offers coaching to paying clients like Daniel. But her ambitions are grander. Through <a href="https://www.theinnercompass.org/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inner Compass Initiative</a>, the nonprofit she runs with her husband, Cooper Davis, she hopes to provide support to a large swath of people interested in reducing or quitting psychiatric medications.</p><p>“People are realizing, ‘I don’t actually need to go find a doctor who knows how to do this,’” she said.

In 2024, the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry, a respected clinical handbook, issued its first “de-prescribing” volume. Dr. Horowitz was one of its authors.</p><p>There are early signs of movement in the United States, as well. Dr. Jonathan E.

Goldberg, the group’s president. “So it really falls to the nonindustry community to ask those questions.”</p><p>Dr. Gerard Sanacora, the director of the Yale Depression Research Program, said there are practical reasons the current health care system “doesn’t provide much support” for patients seeking to reduce medications: Relapse prevention can be time-consuming, and many physicians are only reimbursed for 15-minute “med management” appointments.</p><p>But he said it was important that trained clinicians still have a role. In a “taper,” patients encounter difficulties of two kinds: withdrawal, and the relapse of underlying conditions. It takes skill to distinguish between them, he said, and a licensed practitioner guarantees “some level of minimum competency” during a period of especially high risk.</p><p>“The main thing is, they can worsen and kill themselves,” he said of patients.</p><h2 id="link-25c3bd2e">A success story</h2><p>Ms. Delano entered the conversation in 2010, when she began blogging about her life. She was 27 years old, living with her aunt and uncle and attending day treatment at McLean Hospital in Massachusetts. Her platform was <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mad in America</a>, a website where a range of former psychiatric patients exchanged stories about their treatment.</p><p>Within that subculture, Ms. Delano stood out for her eloquence and charisma. She had grown up in Greenwich, Conn., where she was a top student and standout athlete. A relative of Franklin D. Roosevelt, she was presented as a debutante on two successive nights at New York’s Waldorf Astoria and Plaza hotels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>On her blog, and later in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-challenge-of-going-off-psychiatric-drugs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 10,000-word profile</a> in The New Yorker, she described the shadow plot of her psychiatric treatment.</p><p>In ninth grade, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed Depakote and Prozac. In college, her pharmacologists added Ambien and Provigil. Over the years, this list expanded, but she still seemed to be getting worse. Four times she was so desperate that she checked herself into psychiatric hospitals. At 25, she made a harrowing attempt at suicide.</p><p>Then, at 27, she picked up a book by the journalist Robert Whitaker, “Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America.” In the book, Mr. Whitaker proposed that the increasing use of psychotropic medications was to blame for the rise in psychiatric disorders. In scientific journals, reviewers dismissed Mr. Whitaker’s analysis as polemical, cherry-picking data to support a broad, oversimplified argument.</p><p>But for Ms. Delano, it was an epiphany. She mentally reviewed her treatment history and came to a radical conclusion. “I’d been confronted with something I’d never considered,” she writes in “Unshrunk.”“What if it wasn’t treatment-resistant mental illness that had been sending me ever deeper into the depths of despair and dysfunction, but the treatment itself?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>She quit five drugs over the six months that followed, under the guidance of a psychopharmacologist.

Many readers recognized, in her blog entries, elements of their own stories — the way a diagnosis had become part of their identities, the way a single prescription had expanded into a cocktail.</p><p>She also provided something the ex-patient community had lacked: an aspirational model. Her life had clearly flourished after quitting her medications. In 2019 she married Mr. Davis, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlantic/posts/cooper-davis-thought-he-understood-how-his-medication-for-add-was-affecting-him-/890599346272810/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an activist she met in the ex-patient</a> movement; they are raising two boys in an airy, sun-drenched colonial-style house.</p><p>On the Surviving Antidepressants website, users sometimes invoked her name wistfully.</p><p>“I thought I’d be like a Laura Delano and others and heal right away,” a user from Kansas commented.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>A French user, struggling to wean off Valium, returned to Ms. Delano’s videos as to a mantra.</p><p>“9.30 am: I manage to stop a panic attack with agitation, by breathing.</p><p>10:30 a.m.: It rains.

Ms. Delano found that she was spending 25 hours a week on these calls.

He wanted to make sure, he said, “that the people working on policy are at least considering our ideas.”</p><p>The rollout of Mr. Kennedy’s agenda has raised hopes throughout “critical psychiatry” and “anti-psychiatry” communities that their critiques will, for the first time, be taken seriously.</p><p>Some in the medical world fear this augurs a deepening mistrust in science. And it is true — the written resources Inner Compass provides are overwhelmingly negative about every major class of psychiatric medications, which remain the only evidence-based treatment for severe mental illnesses.</p><p>A section on antipsychotics, for instance, cites <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1707650" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies</a> that purport to show that people who take them fare worse than people who never take them or stop them.

Mr. Whitaker recalled acquaintances who, after setting out to quit their medications, fell into “despair.”</p><p>“Once you start going down that road, it becomes your identity,” said Mr. Whitaker. “People want to come off, and the next thing you know, there’s no service provider, no science, and they’re moving into that void.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>Numerous people in withdrawal communities described members who struggled with suicidal thinking, or who had died by suicide.</p><p>“More often than not, at least from what I’ve seen, once people conclude that the medications hurt them, then it’s all-or-nothing, black-and-white thinking,” said Kate Speer, a strategist for the Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Health Communication<span>  </span>“They can’t recognize the providers are there to help, even when what they have done is not helpful.”</p><p>Ms. Delano said the issue of suicide comes up regularly in withdrawal communities. “I know so many people who have killed themselves over the years, in withdrawal or even beyond” she said. In 2023, a young woman who joined Inner Compass died by suicide, she said.</p><p>Afterward, Ms. Delano and Mr. Davis consoled distraught community members, who worried that they should have taken some action to intervene.</p><p>Ms. Delano said she would call 911 if a member overdosed on pills, but, short of that, she doesn’t weigh in on treatment choices.

He was getting better, he was sure of it, accessing levels of emotion that had been blunted by medication for 15 years.</p><p>He credited Ms. Delano for getting him this far; it was reading her story in the New Yorker that made him see it was possible to “come off the medications and be OK.” On a recent Zoom session, he showed her the Post-it note that he sometimes pulls out as a reminder to himself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>“IT WAS THE DRUGS,” he had written</p><p>“It was the drugs!” Ms. Delano exclaimed.
