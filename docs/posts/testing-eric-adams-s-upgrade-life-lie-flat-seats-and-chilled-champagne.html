Mr. Adams is said to have paid just $300. The rest of his tab was picked up by the hotel.</p><p>Last week, the mayor was accused in a federal indictment of corruptly accepting more than $100,000 in illegal gifts, including expensive airline seats and stays in hotels, in exchange for using his political influence to help Turkey. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/nyregion/eric-adams-arraigned" title="">pleaded not guilty</a> to five felony counts on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">57-page indictment</a>, federal prosecutors portrayed Mr. Adams as a man who, after enjoying a few travel-related upgrades early in his political career, developed a hunger for and expectation of luxury travel that grew increasingly feverish and detail-oriented over the years.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The couch was designed by Bentley Motors, and artwork of the company’s cars hangs on the wall. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Doling out upgrades is not unusual in the travel industry, where special perks are seen as a strategic way to curry favor with influential people. What stands out, according to the indictment, is the ardor of Mr. Adams’s efforts to capitalize on his Turkish connections in order to travel in style, not only when he visited Turkey but also when he insisted on using its national airline to travel to places like Ghana, China and India. Also notable is the blatant nature of the political favors that the mayor is charged with bestowing in return.</p><p>This weekend, a photographer for The New York Times, Clark Hodgin, and I retraced one of Mr. Adams’s trips to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines, long the mayor’s carrier of choice. We, too, enjoyed not thinking about our wearisome responsibilities back home and not having to use our own money while on this rarefied assignment. I also got to spend a night in the Bentley Suite.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The Times paid $9,236.90 for my round-trip ticket, tax included, and the benefits began not in the air, but in the (small, in the scheme of things) Turkish Airlines lounge in Terminal 1 at Kennedy International Airport. On Friday, it was offering typical lounge fare: a breakfast buffet of eggs and other hot entrees, as well as platters of cheese, charcuterie and tiny cakes.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the Turkish Airlines lounge at Kennedy International Airport, the news about Mayor Adams was inescapable. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The breakfast buffet was well stocked at the Turkish Airlines lounge.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>None of the other customers seemed interested in discussing Mr. Adams and what he may or may not have done, perhaps because it was only 5:30 a.m. Still, the mayor’s presence seemed to shimmer invisibly in the air.</p><p>For one thing, his enormous image could be seen looming from the TV screen, illustrating a report on CBS about his legal woes and their connections to Turkish Airlines. Also, in a strange turn of events, the lounge’s Wi-Fi password turned out to be TKNYCADAMS.</p><p>That was merely an odd coincidence, according to the attendant at the front desk, who said that the lounge was operated by a company called Adams International and that its proprietor was a man named John Adams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A reporter’s round-trip ticket in business class on Turkish Airlines cost $9,236.90, tax included.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Flying business class on Turkish Airlines was a lovely experience, as flying business class always is. My joy at being allotted a seat in this happy area for the 10-hour flight was enhanced by my feelings of schadenfreude-infused sympathy for Clark. Though he flew on the same flight, he had bought his ticket too late and thus was stuck back in economy — the exact place Mr. Adams had not wanted to be. (Clark’s ticket cost The Times $2,289.90.) I felt sorry for him, wedged into his cramped seat with no one catering to his every whim, but not sorry enough to offer to switch places.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-21"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The amenities kit included eye shades, ear plugs, a toothbrush, slippers and more.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Turkish Airlines is known for its food, and the breakfast meal back in economy included waffles, feta cheese and fruit.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Up front, it was far too easy to get used to it all.

He didn’t fly first class, for instance (possibly because Turkish Airlines doesn’t have one). Meanwhile, while the airline’s business class took the top award for its food service <a href="https://www.worldairlineawards.com/worlds-best-business-class-airlines-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the 2024 Skytrax World Airlines Awards rankings of airlines’ business classes,</a> it came just 10th in overall quality.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-29"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/28/autossell/00istanbul-fruit-vid-still/IMG_0752-edit-still-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/28/autossell/00istanbul-fruit-vid-still/IMG_0752-edit-still-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/09/28/125997_1_00istanbul-plane-vid_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Dinner is served onboard the flight from New York to Istanbul.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>And while the 1,345-square foot Bentley Suite is considered one of the most luxe accommodations at the St. Regis, it’s not as luxe as <a href="https://www.travoh.com/stays/the-st-regis-istanbul-hotel-istanbul-turkey/attachment/057-the-st-regis-istanbul-hotel-istanbul-turkey-presidential-suite-guest-bedroom/#google_vignette" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Presidential Suite</a>, which has two bedrooms, not one. Nor is the hotel arguably the grandest in Istanbul. Mr. Adams is said to have planned to stay in one of the city’s two Four Seasons properties for a nominal fee on another trip in 2021 that would also have included “a yacht tour, a three-day stay at a luxury beach resort, and a car and driver,” according to the indictment. (Alas, he canceled the trip at the last minute.)</p><p>Mr. Adams has not been said to have accepted free rides on anyone’s private jet (hello, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas) or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/nyregion/senator-robert-menendez-bribery-conviction.html" title="">convicted of amassing solid gold bars, cash and a luxury Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible</a> in a bribery scheme benefiting Egypt, as recently happened to Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey.</p><p>Yet it’s hard not to read the story of Mr. Adams and his trips as a cautionary tale about the perils of accepting free luxury anything, especially if you’re a politician obliged to fill out pesky financial disclosure forms. It may indeed be better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, but not when it comes to travel. Once you’ve been in the front of a plane or stayed in one of the best rooms at a five-star hotel, it’s disproportionately painful to be sent back to economy or forced to return once again to <a href="https://residence-inn.marriott.com/hotel-suites/suite-details/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Studio Suite at the Residence Inn.</a></p><p>Cenk Öcal, who as general manager of Turkish Airlines in New York was said in the indictment to have served as the point person for Mr. Adams’s numerous seat-upgrade requests, seems to have understood this all too well, dangling business-class seats in front of the mayor as both carrot and stick. After Mr. Adams was elected mayor, Mr. Öcal began angling for a spot on his transition committee.</p><p>“It would suit me well to be lead Or Senior Advisor,” Mr. Öcal wrote in a text to an Adams staffer, according to the indictment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“Lead Plz :),” he later texted, and then added — deploying perhaps the most horrifying generic threat imaginable to someone terrified of being relegated to the back of the plane — “Otherwise seat number 52 is empty.”</p><p><em>Susan Beachy contributed research.</em></p><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
