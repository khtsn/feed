During Donald J. Trump’s first term as president, roughly 800,000 of the federal government’s more than two million employees were sidelined for over a month starting in December 2018. The economy <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54937" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took a major hit</a>.</p><p>As lawmakers raced to secure a funding deal that would keep the government open beyond Friday’s midnight deadline, Washington and its large federal work force braced for a potentially disruptive holiday season. Travel would still likely proceed without major interruptions, as Transportation Security Administration employees and air traffic controllers would largely continue to work. But like during the late 2018 shutdown, travelers could face delays at airports.</p><p>Carter Langston, a Transportation Security Administration spokesman, said on Thursday that 59,000 of the agency’s 62,000 employees were considered “essential,” meaning they would continue working without pay during a shutdown. The agency expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays.</p><p>“While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,” Mr. Langston said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A shutdown would cause enormous strain on furloughed government workers and those required to still work, most of whom would do so without pay until funding is restored.</p><h2 id="link-53111697">How does the federal government prepare?</h2><p>The White House’s Office of Management and Budget maintains <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/agency-contingency-plans/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a collection of plans</a> that federal agencies have developed in the event of a shutdown.
