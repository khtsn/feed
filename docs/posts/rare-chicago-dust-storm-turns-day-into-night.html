Soils across central Illinois are exceptionally dry this spring, and dry soil is easily lifted up into the air by winds.</p><p>“And it’s not just the topsoil that’s dry,” said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. “It’s going down a couple meters.”</p><p>Mr. Hurley said the soil moisture in the area was at only 2 to 5 percent, making it among the driest ever.</p><p>The Weather Service’s Romeoville office, which covers much of Northern Illinois and a sliver of northwest Indiana, has issued dust storm warnings for only one other weather event, which happened in 2023 in an agricultural area. That warning did not include Chicago.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/us/dust-storm-illinois-i55-crash.html" title="">2023 dust storm</a>, seven people died in a crash involving 72 vehicles on Interstate 55 in central Illinois.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Chicago was last affected by a significant dust storm during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, specifically on May 10, 1934, according to Rafal Ogorek, a forecaster with the Weather Service.</p><p>Dust storms also affected portions of the Chicago metro area in April 1935 and on May 31, 1985.</p><p>Mr. Ogorek noted that his office could not “find any documentation that suggested that either of those dust storms produced significant visibility reductions.”</p><p>The dust storm on Friday formed near Bloomington, Ill., at about 4:30 p.m. local time when thunderstorms in central Illinois generated a push of whipping and howling winds with speeds up to 70 miles per hour.</p><p>As the winds surged northward, they swept aloft dust from parched farmland.</p><p>A dust storm generated by winds from thunderstorms is called a haboob, a term often used in the Middle East, where dust storms are common.</p><p>Thomas Gill, a professor of environmental science and engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso, said it was appropriate to call Friday’s storm a haboob.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Professor Gill said images and videos of Friday’s storm “show the classic appearance of a haboob” with a “wall of dust rolling across the land.”</p><p>Traveling at about 60 m.p.h., the dust storm moved into downtown Chicago by about 6:30 p.m.</p><p>Dan Belko, 51, who lives in the Old Town section of Chicago, said his wife got a warning about the storm on her phone just as they were stepping outside for dinner.</p><p>“You could see the change in the atmosphere,” Mr. Belko said. “It looked like a fog, but not a very thick fog.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Graff is a Times reporter covering weather, wildfires and earthquakes.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
