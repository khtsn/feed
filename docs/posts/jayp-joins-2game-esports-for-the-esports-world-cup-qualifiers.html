The legislation is vital to President Trump’s campaign promise to cut taxes. The measure is being closely watched by investors who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/dealbook/bond-traders-budget-tax-cuts.html" title="">fear it</a> will expand the federal deficit and roil the bond market.</p><p><strong>Big banks are reportedly on the cusp of a major lobbying victory.</strong> The Fed and other agencies are weighing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/15/bank-capital-fed-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the easing of capital rules</a>, according to The Washington Post. (The agencies have long argued that stricter requirements crimp lending.) The move is the latest sign that the Trump administration intends to adopt a more industry-friendly approach for banks and Wall Street.</p><p><strong>The S.E.C. is investigating Coinbase.</strong> The inquiry centers on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/technology/coinbase-sec-investigation.html" title="">the company’s claims that it had more than 100 million</a> “verified users,” according to The Times. Worth noting: Since President Trump took office, the S.E.C. has dropped dozens of lawsuits and investigations related to crypto enterprises. The Trump family has multiple investments in crypto businesses. Separately, Coinbase <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/coinbase-global-says-customer-data-stolen-held-for-ransom-e5108336" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faces a $20 million ransom demand</a> from cybercriminals in a data breach.</p><p><strong>Novo Nordisk’s C.E.O. will step down. </strong><a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=916007" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen</a>, who oversaw the Danish drugmaker’s rapid rise as it commercialized the popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, will soon step down, the company said on Friday. Novo Nordisk’s stock has more than halved in the past year as GLP-1 competition intensifies and Trump’s pharma tariffs loom, a performance that hastened the company’s decision to find a new C.E.O.</p><h2 id="link-30fe7865">A cable mega-deal emerges</h2><p>As the second Trump administration began, deal makers had hoped for a revival of big-ticket mergers. So far, however, that enthusiasm has been tempered as top antitrust officials suggested they wouldn’t bless just any transaction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A new test of how the Trump competition cops view the issue just arrived: Charter agreed to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/charter-communications-and-cox-communications-announce-definitive-agreement-to-combine-companies-302457690.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">buy a top rival, Cox</a>, at a $34.5 billion valuation.</p><p><strong>The deal would consolidate two of the nation’s top cable providers.</strong> Under the proposal, Charter will pay cash and stock, with the combined company set to take on the Cox name within a year after closing. Cox Enterprises, in which Cox’s eponymous founding family holds a controlling stake, would become the unified entity’s largest shareholder with a stake of approximately 23 percent.</p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time the two have discussed a tie-up: They held talks <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-02/cox-said-to-discuss-merger-with-malone-backed-charter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">12 years ago</a>, and John Malone, the telecom billionaire who is a major Charter shareholder, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/malone-makes-pitch-for-more-cable-tv-consolidation-with-charter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had named Cox</a> last fall as a potential transaction target.</p><p><strong>It’s one of the biggest takeovers announced this year,</strong> along with Google’s planned acquisition of the cybersecurity provider Wiz for $32 billion. And it may illustrate that, at least for some corporate chiefs, uncertainty on the economy, driven in part by President Trump’s trade policies, isn’t enough to deter major investments and acquisitions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Charter and Cox argue the deal helps them compete against big rivals,</strong> including “larger, national broadband companies” — read: Comcast, Verizon, and others — as well as satellite service providers. They are also likely to point out that their cable networks don’t overlap.</p><p><strong>How will Trump’s antitrust enforcers respond?</strong> It helps that the Charter-Cox deal doesn’t involve tech giants, which top competition officials and Vice President JD Vance have singled out as ongoing targets of scrutiny. Some corporate advisers have also said they believe Trump officials may be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/dealmakers-are-struggling-to-make-sense-of-trumps-antitrust-policy-2d9bf77c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more open to proposals</a> to allay their concerns than their Biden-era counterparts were.</p><p>Still, Trump antitrust leaders have warned corporate America not to assume that all deals will pass muster. “I don’t have an ideological predisposition against M.&amp;A.,” <a href="https://www.mlex.com/mlex/articles/2320310/ferguson-says-us-ftc-aims-to-strike-right-balance-on-merger-control" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andrew Ferguson</a>, the chair of the F.T.C., said last month. “It doesn’t follow, however, that I think it should just be open season” for deal-making.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-71b4ad77">Scandal casts a shadow on Davos succession</h2><p>The World Economic Forum, the organizer of the glitzy annual confab of business, political and nonprofit leaders in Davos, Switzerland, has found itself uncomfortably thrust into the spotlight, amid allegations of impropriety <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/davos-klaus-schwab-downfall-a54b4211" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">against its founder, Klaus Schwab</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But the accusations, which led to Schwab’s resignation as chair last month, have also reportedly thrown a wrench into the forum’s succession planning — and raise questions about the moneymaking enterprise’s future.</p><p><strong>A recap:</strong> The forum’s board opened an inquiry after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/world-economic-forum-davos-klaus-schwab.html" title="">receiving an anonymous letter</a> that accused the family of the 87-year-old Schwab, a German economist who founded the organization in 1971, of improper use of funds. He had already faced allegations of overseeing a toxic work environment where female and Black employees felt discriminated against.</p><p>Schwab has denied any wrongdoing, but stepped down as chair last month after clashing with other directors. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, a former chair of Nestlé, is leading the board for now.</p><p><strong>Schwab’s early departure is said to complicate plans for one potential candidate:</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/with-the-original-davos-man-gone-wef-seeks-to-secure-ecb-s-lagarde-as-successor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Christine Lagarde</a>, the president of the European Central Bank and a longtime Davos attendee, according to Bloomberg. Schwab had intended to stay on until 2027, the year that Lagarde’s E.C.B. term runs out, Bloomberg reports; Lagarde has said she won’t leave ahead of schedule.</p><p>While she is considered the favorite, according to Bloomberg, other potential candidates include David Rubenstein, the co-founder of the investment giant Carlyle and a forum director.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>There’s a lot at stake.</strong> The forum collects about $500 million a year, according to The Wall Street Journal, with most of that coming from membership payments and corporate sponsorships for its events.</p><p>The Schwab allegations have already <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/011d575b-d594-4c96-a0bd-21e57d682a78" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">started to worry some companies</a> that shell out millions each year to attend the Davos conference, according to The Financial Times.

Zuckerberg told company executives in an email that he wanted to “neutralize” Instagram. He testified that it was normal to think about acquisition as a strategy to stay ahead.</p></li><li><p><strong>Instagram’s growth was stunted under Meta.</strong> Systrom testified that the app didn’t get as many resources as promised because Zuckerberg “believed we were a threat to their growth,” referring to Facebook. But he also acknowledged that Instagram benefited from Meta’s resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Meta monopolized the market. </strong>The government’s case relied on defining the market as “personal social networking” apps that focus on connecting family and friends — a narrow definition that would make the far smaller Snapchat its main rival. Zuckerberg countered that only about 20 percent of the content on Facebook, and about 10 percent of the content on Instagram, was from user’s friends, and that the company also competed with TikTok and YouTube.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What are Meta’s chances?</strong> During the case, Boasberg continued to question some of the government’s arguments, noting, for example, that many apps, like TikTok and YouTube, also have features for sharing with friends and family. </p><ul><li><p>Separately, Meta has reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-is-delaying-the-rollout-of-its-flagship-ai-model-f4b105f7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delayed the launch of its latest A.I. model</a> from a scheduled released last month, The Wall Street Journal reports.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-7c091e00"><span>THE SPEED READ </span></h3><p><strong>Deals</strong></p><ul><li><p>The investment firm Thoma Bravo has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/thoma-bravo-sells-remaining-nasdaq-stake-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-05-15/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold off its remaining $3.4 billion stake</a> in Nasdaq, which it had held since 2023.
