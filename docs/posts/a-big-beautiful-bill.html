    <h1>A ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Congressional Republicans are currently working on what President Trump calls his “big, beautiful bill.” House committees pulled all-nighters yesterday to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/congress-tax-medicaid.html" title="">advance several pieces</a> of his agenda. The legislation takes on two of Trump’s priorities: tax cuts and immigration funding. But to pay for them, Republicans are looking for other programs to slash — most contentiously, those that help low-income Americans, particularly Medicaid and food stamps.</p><p>The bill still needs to pass the House and the Senate, so it’s subject to change. For now, here’s what’s in it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tax cuts:</strong> The legislation extends the parts of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire. This would cut nearly everyone’s taxes to some degree, but about half the cost of the extension is cuts for people <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/charts/reversing-tax-cuts-for-people-with-incomes-above-400000-would-lower-the-cost-of-extending-0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who make $400,000 or more a year</a>. The proposal also includes an expansion of the child tax credit and temporary tax breaks on tips and overtime pay.</p></li><li><p><strong>Medicaid:</strong> Changes to the health insurance program would leave around eight million Americans uninsured. The bill says that poor, childless adults must work at least 80 hours every month to qualify. It would also require beneficiaries to pay more fees and complete more paperwork to prove they are eligible for Medicaid. Supporters say these measures would help root out waste and fraud. Critics say the bill effectively cuts support for the poor to fund tax cuts for the rich.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> The bill would increase funding to help build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and crack down on illegal immigration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clean energy:</strong> Joe Biden enacted hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for electric vehicles and other clean energy initiatives. Republicans would phase out most of that money.</p></li><li><p><strong>And more:</strong> The bill would also make states pay more for food stamps, which could force them to cut benefits for poor Americans. It would create “MAGA” savings accounts for newborns, starting them out with $1,000 and letting parents contribute $5,000 per year tax-free until a child turns 31. It would raise taxes on colleges and universities. It would increase military spending. It would repeal Biden’s student loan forgiveness program. And those are only some of the biggest items. (The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/13/republican-trump-tax-immigration-plan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke down other elements of the bill</a>.)</p></li></ul><p>One unanswered question: <strong>Will the bill pass?</strong> Republicans are divided. Fiscal conservatives say the legislation doesn’t cut enough spending; it would add trillions to the debt over 10 years. But moderates and populists on the right argue that the bill already cuts too much. They say the Medicaid changes, in particular, could hurt working-class Americans, many of whom have started voting Republican but could walk away from the party if it slashes their benefits.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>The cuts could give Americans cash back. But they would likely only last for a few years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-temporary.html" title="">until Trump is set to leave office</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/15/us/politics/trump-budget-reconciliation-process.html" title="">These charts show how</a> Republicans can pass Trump’s fiscal agenda with no Democratic support.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-352fe80d"><span><strong>TRUMP’S CHOSEN REFUGEES</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>White South Africans.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joao Silva/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>On his first day in office, President Trump stopped the United States from taking in refugees. But he left a carve-out for South Africans, who he falsely says are the victims of genocide. This week, the first planeload of them arrived. Can Trump choose one population of refugees over others? I asked <strong>Hamed Aleaziz</strong>, who covers immigration in Washington. <em>— Adam B. Kushner</em></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><em>This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>Does the president decide who qualifies as a refugee?</strong></p><p>No. The law says applicants have to “fear persecution” in their home countries. And there’s a ceiling on how many the United States can admit every year. Trump merely directed the government to process would-be Afrikaner immigrants as refugees.</p><p><strong>He said on Monday that he had “essentially extended citizenship” to them. Is that true? </strong></p><p>Not yet, but they’re on a pathway that eventually leads to citizenship. Refugees can apply for a green card after a year. Then they have to wait for several years to naturalize. So it’s not automatic. And as we’ve learned in recent months, people can still be picked up by ICE and deported even if they have a green card.</p><p><strong>He also called them victims of “genocide.” Why? Is there even a genocide in South Africa?</strong></p><p>Our reporting hasn’t shown that, no. But Trump believes white South Africans have been persecuted by their government. So were the Afghans in the United States as refugees, yet Trump ended their protection from deportation. Administration officials say that’s because the Afghans weren’t properly vetted for national security.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> The New Yorker reports that human-rights groups — and even other Afrikaners — have <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/newsletter/the-daily/why-trump-talks-about-a-genocide-in-south-africa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected Trump’s claims</a>. “We are not victims, there is no genocide,” one man wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-761d5fb7">More on immigration</h2><ul><li><p>Trump has been talking about granting asylum to white South African farmers for years. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/trump-south-africa-afrikaners.html" title="">Read the inside story of how it happened</a>.</p></li><li><p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/georgetown-academic-immigration-detention.html" title="">ordered the release of a Georgetown academic</a>, an Indian national, whom the government arrested in March over his support of Palestinians.</p></li><li><p>Government lawyers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/health/detained-russian-scientist-harvard.html" title="">want to deport a Harvard scientist to Russia</a>.
