He knew reaching its 26,335-foot, or 8,027-meter, summit would require entering the so-called death zone where organs begin to shut down, minute by minute.</p><p>But tragedy struck before he could begin his climb.</p><p>Avalanches on the mountain killed two climbers who were each vying to be the first American woman to summit the world’s 14 highest mountains, and the two Sherpas guiding them. Among the dead was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/world/asia/sherpa-mountain-climber-record.html" title="">Tenjen Lama Sherpa</a>, a decorated mountain guide whom Mr. Sherpa considered a mentor and friend. So he set aside his own record attempt and joined the rescue effort to help other stranded climbers off the mountain.</p><p>“We’re still in shock,” Mr. Sherpa, soft-spoken and thoughtful, said in a September Zoom interview from his home in Kathmandu. “He was the strongest guy I knew.”</p><p>Mr. Sherpa, 18, recently returned to Mount Shishapangma carrying the memory of his mentor. On Wednesday, he reached the summit and became the youngest person to scale the “8,000ers,” the 14 mountains over 8,000 meters tall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His climbs were confirmed on Thursday by Rakesh Gurung, the head of the mountaineering division of Nepal’s Department of Tourism. The previous record-holder, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mingma_david_sherpa/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mingma Gyabu Sherpa</a>, finished climbing them in 2019 <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/383416-youngest-person-to-climb-all-8-000-m-mountains#:~:text=Youngest%20person%20to%20climb%20all,%22%20Sherpa%20(Nepal%2C%20b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at the age of 30</a>, according to Guinness World Records. Certifying a record can take days or even months, the organization says on its <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/the-application-process/how-long-does-it-take" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>Ahead of the latest climb, Mr. Sherpa said that he hoped his achievement would elevate the role of Nepal’s ethnic Sherpas in a high-stakes activity where they shoulder much of the risk but often receive a fraction of the glory.</p><p>“I have to show that we are as good as any foreign athletes,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Sherpa training at his home in Kathmandu, Nepal, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Prakash Mathema/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Nepal’s ethnic Sherpas are the mountain guides who pave the way for foreign climbers to fulfill dreams and break records. They fix ropes, lug food and heavy equipment, and steer their clients up summits. Doing all of that work requires them to spend more time in the death zone, which begins at around 8,000 meters, than their clients do.</p><p>Sherpas represent about a third of the more than 300 known deaths on Mount Everest. They are often relegated to the footnotes of mountaineering history, and are rarely afforded the lucrative endorsements that foreign mountaineers can attract.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Tenjen Lama Sherpa, for example, guided <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/12/world/asia/kristin-harila-himalayas-dying-climber.html" title="">the Norwegian climber Kristin Harila</a> as she summited the 8,000ers in record time last year. But even though he did everything she did and more, Ms. Harila received most of the money, fame and attention.</p><p>“If you really understand high-altitude mountaineering, you’ll know how much Sherpas have contributed to the whole industry, right?” Mr. Sherpa said. “And they’re basically not having their names recognized as much as other climbers.”</p><p>Mr. Sherpa hopes to change that by positioning himself as an athlete, not just a guide. And at a time when many Sherpas are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/world/asia/sherpas-everest.html" title="">leaving the industry or discouraging their children from joining it</a> because of its dangers, modest compensation and limited safety net, he wants to prove that mountaineering can be a prestigious career.</p><p>In some ways, being able to see the sport this way is a privilege. Unlike many other Sherpas, for whom mountain guiding is a pathway out of poverty, Mr. Sherpa pursues it as a passion.</p><p>Mr. Sherpa is “well-known in the climbing community for his age and accomplishments,” said Alan Arnette, an American mountaineer who <a href="https://www.alanarnette.com/blog/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> about climbing in the Himalayas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Arnette said that while climbing all 14 mountains is still a notable accomplishment, it has become easier over the years as better infrastructure and support systems have enabled more climbers to summit. Mr. Sherpa has an advantage, he added, because his family runs one of Nepal’s largest mountaineering expedition operations.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Sherpa, left, in Kathmandu last year with Kristin Halira, center, and Tenjen Lama Sherpa, a decorated guide who died last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sanjit Pariyar/NurPhoto, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>From a young age, Mr. Sherpa was surrounded by stories of his family’s mountaineering accomplishments. His father, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_IuxwNSoWH/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tashi Lakpa Sherpa</a>, was 19 when he became the youngest person to summit Mount Everest without using supplemental oxygen. And his two uncles, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/14mingma/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mingma Sherpa</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/14dawa/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chhang Dawa Sherpa</a>, were the first pair of brothers to each climb the 14 highest mountains. Together, they established two companies that organize expeditions for foreign climbers that cost tens of thousands of dollars per person.</p><p>His parents wanted to ensure that he had opportunities outside of mountaineering, Mr. Sherpa said. He grew up in the capital, Kathmandu, where he received a high school education, experimented with photography and aspired to be a professional soccer player. But he eventually found his way back to the family business.</p><p>Making his name as a Sherpa athlete hasn’t been easy, he said, and so far he has struggled to draw the attention of brands and land major sponsorships. But he hopes his record will change that.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“My dream is very simple,” he added. “It’s just to be one of the best athletes in mountaineering, make a really good name for myself and be the guy who big brands choose to sponsor.”</p><p>At 16, he embarked on his mission to climb the 8000ers, a feat that only a few dozen people have completed. More than physicality or skill, he said, “It’s about who can suffer the most when times are the worst.”</p><p>He said his own mental fortitude was a result of learning to see death as a normal part of the work, and to not let it get in the way.</p><p>“If you see anything go wrong, you have to trust your team,” he said. “You have to trust your instincts.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Sherpa climbed his first of the 14 peaks, Nepal’s 8,163-meter Mount Manaslu, in August 2022. Over the next two years, he summited the others, including Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain, as part of commercial expeditions organized by his family.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Sherpa in Kathmandu in August 2023 after climbing K2.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Prakash Mathema/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He left Mount Shishapangma, the smallest of the 8000ers, for his last ascent. That is partly because he had to wait for the Chinese government to open access to the mountain, which was closed to climbers during the pandemic.</p><p>As he waited for his paperwork, he said, he wasn’t sure how he would react when he returned to the place where his mentor had died a year earlier alongside the guide Mingmar Sherpa and the two American climbers, Gina Marie Rzucidlo and Anna Gutu.</p><p>Tenjen Lama Sherpa’s death was destabilizing because it presented a stark reminder of mountaineering’s deadly risks, he said. “Will I be there,” he asked himself, “and just realize, ‘This mountain has taken someone I had a lot of good times with and a lot of respect for?’”</p><p>But he couldn’t let the tragedy distract him from his next expedition.</p><p>“That’s all we can do,” he said. “Try our best and take care of each other and just be safe.”</p><p>Bhadra Sharma<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Oct. 10, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a Norwegian climber.
