Trump used his social-media website on Wednesday to amplify a crude remark about Vice President Kamala Harris that suggested Ms. Harris traded sexual favors to help her political career.</p><p>The post, by another user on Truth Social, was an image of Ms. Harris and Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s opponent in 2016. The text read: “Funny how blowjobs impacted both their careers differently…”</p><p>The remark was a reference to Mrs. Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and a right-wing contention that Ms. Harris’s romantic relationship with Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco whom she dated in the mid-1990s while he was speaker of the California State Assembly, fueled her political rise.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s repost was the second time in 10 days that the former president shared content from his personal account making sexually oriented attacks on Ms. Harris. Though he has a history of making crass insults about his opponents, the reposts signal Mr. Trump’s willingness to continue to shatter longstanding norms of political speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The image Mr. Trump shared on Wednesday morning was another user’s screenshot of a post on X, and it was a reply to an unrelated video clip Mr. Trump had posted on Tuesday night. Mr. Trump reposted the image as part of a series of 30 reposts he made on Truth Social between 8:02 and 8:32 a.m. on Wednesday, including several posts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/us/politics/trump-social-media-extremism.html" title="">with references to the QAnon</a> conspiracy theory movement and its slogan.</p><p>Previously, on Aug. 18, Mr. Trump had shared a video from the Dilley Meme Team — a group of right-wing internet content creators that makes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/us/politics/trump-meme-trolls-2024.html" title="">pro-Trump videos and memes</a> denigrating his opponents — that parodied the Alanis Morissette song “Ironic” to attack Ms. Harris as “moronic.” In the parody song, the singer says Ms. Harris “spent her whole damn life down on her knees,” at which point a photo of Mr. Brown appears onscreen.</p><p>The Harris campaign, which has largely ignored Mr. Trump’s personal attacks, declined to comment. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly been accused of sexual misconduct and was found liable last year for sexual abuse and defamation. He has a history of attacking female opponents and critics in deeply personal terms, often describing them as mentally ill or at times expressing contempt in epithets.</p><p>Republicans close to Mr. Trump have expressed concern that he and his allies risk alienating women, Black voters and moderate swing-state voters if they continue to use racist and sexist attacks against Ms. Harris, the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to accept a major party’s presidential nomination. Mr. Trump last week acknowledged that some of his advisers have urged him to move away from personal attacks, a shift he said he did not plan to take.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Last month, Mr. Trump questioned Ms. Harris’s identity as a Black woman, suggesting at a convention of Black journalists that Ms. Harris had used her racial profile as a way to gain a political advantage.</p><p>Ms. Harris has for decades been subject to attacks like the ones Mr. Trump amplified, though they became more frequent during the 2020 presidential campaign, when she was President Biden’s running mate. Critics pointed to her relationship with Mr. Brown as a way to question her qualifications. And after the right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh suggested falsely, quoting from a conservative website, that Ms. Harris had “slept her way up,” T-shirts with the slogan “Joe and the Hoe” were worn by Mr. Trump’s supporters.</p><p>The slogan remained popular throughout Mr. Trump’s third presidential bid, and T-shirts bearing the phrase were frequently seen at Mr. Trump’s rallies up until Mr. Biden suspended his presidential bid.</p><p>Ms. Harris and her allies have over the years dismissed the claims that her relationship with Mr. Brown was central to her political rise, calling such attacks sexist and saying that she was qualified for positions she has held, including two state posts that Mr. Brown appointed her to, as well as winning elections as district attorney of San Francisco and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/kamala-harris-2010-debate.html" title="">California attorney general</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump frequently deployed gender-based attacks against Mrs. Clinton in his successful 2016 campaign. Faced with criticism over his treatment of women and the release of the “Access Hollywood” recording in which he crudely boasted about grabbing women’s genitals, Mr. Trump repeatedly pointed to the sexual indiscretions of Mrs. Clinton’s husband.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Throughout his political career, Mr. Trump has made a habit of sharing others’ divisive or offensive social media posts, then dismissing criticism by arguing he was simply reposting.</p><p>Last year, a jury found that Mr. Trump had sexually abused the writer E. Jean Carroll in a dressing room in the mid-1990s, then defamed her in a Truth Social post. Earlier this year, Ms. Carroll was awarded an $83.3 million judgment for continued attacks in social media posts.</p><p>Ken Bensinger<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Gold is a political correspondent for The Times covering the campaigns of Donald J.
