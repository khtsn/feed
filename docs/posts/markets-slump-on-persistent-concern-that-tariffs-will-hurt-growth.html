<p>World Stock Markets This Month</p>
</div></section><div></div><p><time datetime="2025-04-21T08:11:27-04:00"><span>April 21, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>8:11 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Markets on Monday continued to reverberate from President Trump’s trade war and threats to try to remove the chair of the Federal Reserve, with stocks slumping, bonds selling off and the U.S. dollar continuing to lose ground.</p><p>U.S. stock markets, which reopen Monday after the Good Friday holiday, were pointing to a lower open. S&amp;P 500 futures were more than 1 percent lower.</p><p>U.S. government bonds, which have emerged as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/bond-market-tariffs-trump.html" title="">a major concern for Wall Street and the White House</a>, showed renewed stress, with the 10-year Treasury yield jumping above 4.4 percent. (Yields move inversely to prices.) Gold surged to another record high, as investors sought out assets not tied to the U.S. dollar.</p><p>In Asia, the Nikkei 225, Japan’s benchmark stock index, fell 1.3 percent. The Nikkei ended last week on an upswing on hopes of a trade deal with the United States. Taiwan stocks fell 1.5 percent. Stocks in Japan and Taiwan, both of which are highly intertwined trading partners with the United States, are the worst performers this year in Asia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many markets, including those in Hong Kong, Australia and much of Europe, remained closed on Monday for Easter holidays.</p><p>The price of oil, which has fallen as much as 24 percent since mid-January, was down nearly 3 percent on Monday, with Brent crude at about $66 a barrel. Oil prices are often considered a barometer of future economic growth, and they have been weighed down by the prospect that Trump’s tariffs will damage international trade.</p><p>The U.S. dollar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/business/us-dollar-trump-tariffs.html" title="">continued its slide</a> against nearly every other major currency. It fell more than 1 percent against the euro on Monday, to the lowest in more than three years. The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen, to its lowest level since September. The trend is even more stark against some other currencies: The dollar is the lowest it has been against the Swiss Franc in more than a decade.</p><p>Mr. Trump lashed out last week at Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, claiming the Fed should lower interest rates. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Thursday when asked about Mr. Powell.</p><p>The president is said to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/trump-powell-fed-markets.html" title="">wary of trying to oust Mr. Powell</a> before his term as chair is up next year, which would probably inject even more volatility into already jittery financial markets. The political independence of the Fed is seen as critical across world financial markets, and threats to that independence has made investors anxious about the stability of assets priced in dollars, long considered safe and reliable place to park money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We believe dollar weakness will continue,” said Win Thin, a managing director at Brown Brother Harriman, in a note. He added, though, that recent gains in some currencies may not last because economic growth was likely to weaken.</p><p>Investors remain on edge over the global economy. Mr. Trump has drastically raised U.S. tariffs on imports, as high as 145 percent on Chinese goods, to flatten U.S. trade imbalances. Beyond tariffs, Washington has tightened trade on critical items such as advanced silicon chips. China has responded with high tariffs on U.S. goods and restrictions on exports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/china-rare-earths-us.html" title="">rare earth minerals and magnets</a>, essential for electric car motors and other technologies.</p><p>Economists project these changes will raise prices while impeding growth.</p><p>Trump administration officials have said many U.S. trading partners have sought to make deals to avoid suffocating tariffs, but no agreements have been announced. And it remains unclear if any talks are underway between Washington and Beijing to ease those sky-high tariffs.</p><p>An early sign of the upheaval in international trade caused by Mr. Trump this month has come from data in South Korea, where exports to the United States fell by more than 14 percent in the first 20 days of April, versus the same period last year. That was much weaker than expected, analysts at Nomura pointed out, calling the numbers “the canary in the coal mine” for sharply lower exports from Asia in the months ahead.</p><p>The coming week will also provide updates on how companies are coping with the changes. Tesla will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday, and Alphabet and Intel on Thursday. Their forecasts will be scoured to pinpoint the projected impact of the new trade policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And the International Monetary Fund has already warned that its latest projections for the global economy, to be released on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/business/economy/imf-trump-tariffs-global-economy.html" title="">will forecast slower growth and higher inflation</a> this year than previously anticipated.</p><p>“Protracted high uncertainty raises the risk of financial market stress,” Kristalina Georgieva, the I.M.F. managing director, said in a speech on Thursday.</p><p>The decline of the dollar may be a reflection of that stress. On the surface, a weaker dollar makes American goods cheaper overseas, and imports more expensive. But a substantial shift could signal that investors are moving away from a decades-long belief that the dollar and U.S. assets were a safe haven, and are instead choosing to put their money elsewhere.</p><p>That shift can be seen in the dash for gold, which has surged nearly 30 percent in price this year. Gold set yet another record high on Monday, rising above $3,400 per ounce for the first time.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/international-monetary-fund">International Monetary Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/intel-corporation">Intel Corporation</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Test of China’s Status:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/asia/china-trump-tariffs-trade.html">Beijing is mounting a diplomatic full court press</a> to try to prevent other countries from siding with the United States in isolating China.
