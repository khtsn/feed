<p>World Stock Markets This Month</p>
</div></section><p><time datetime="2025-04-21T02:49:36-04:00"><span>April 21, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>2:49 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Markets on Monday continued to reverberate from President Trump’s trade war, with Japan stocks slumping, the U.S. dollar continuing to lose ground and oil prices slipping.</p><p>U.S. stock markets, which reopen Monday after the Good Friday holiday, were pointing to a lower open. S&amp;P 500 futures were nearly 1 percent lower.</p><p>The Nikkei 225, Japan’s benchmark stock index, fell 1.3 percent. The Nikkei ended last week on an upswing on hopes of a trade deal with the United States. Taiwan’s benchmark fell 1.5 percent. Stocks in Japan and Taiwan, both of which are highly intertwined trading partners with the United States, are the worst performers this year in Asia.</p><p>Oil futures, which have fallen as much as 24 percent since mid-January, were down about 1.3 percent on Monday, with Brent crude at about $67 a barrel. Oil prices are often considered a barometer of future economic growth, and they have been weighed down by the prospect that Trump’s tariffs will damage international trade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The U.S. dollar continued its slide against Japanese yen on Monday, falling nearly 1 percent, the lowest since September. Against the euro, the dollar fell about as much, to the lowest in more than three years.</p><p>“We believe dollar weakness will continue,” said Win Thin, a managing director at Brown Brother Harriman, in a note. He noted though that recent gains in some currencies may not last because economic growth was likely to weaken.</p><p>Many markets, including those in Hong Kong, Australia and much of Europe, remained closed on Monday for Easter holidays.</p><p>Investors remain on edge over the global economy. Mr. Trump has drastically raised U.S. tariffs on imports, as high as 145 percent on Chinese goods, to flatten U.S. trade imbalances. Beyond tariffs, Washington has tightened trade on critical items such as advanced silicon chips. China has responded with high tariffs on U.S. goods and restrictions on exports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/china-rare-earths-us.html" title="">rare earth minerals and magnets</a>, essential for electric car motors and other technologies.</p><p>Economists project these changes will raise prices while impeding growth.</p><p>Trump administration officials have said many U.S. trading partners have sought to make deals to avoid suffocating tariffs, but no agreements have been announced. And it remains unclear if any talks are underway between Washington and Beijing to ease those sky-high tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The coming week will provide updates on how companies are coping with the changes. Tesla will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday, and Alphabet and Intel on Thursday. Their forecasts will be scoured to pinpoint the projected impact of the new trade policies.</p><p>And the International Monetary Fund has already warned that its latest projections for the global economy, to be released on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/business/economy/imf-trump-tariffs-global-economy.html" title="">will forecast slower growth and higher inflation</a> this year than previously anticipated.</p><p>“Protracted high uncertainty raises the risk of financial market stress,” Kristalina Georgieva, the I.M.F. managing director, said in a speech on Thursday.</p><p>The decline of the dollar may be a reflection of that stress. On the surface, a weaker dollar makes American goods cheaper overseas, and imports more expensive. But a substantial shift could signal that investors are moving away from a decades-long belief that the dollar and U.S. assets were a safe haven, and are instead choosing to put their money elsewhere.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
