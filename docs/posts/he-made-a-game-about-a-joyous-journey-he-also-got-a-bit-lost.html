The neon green lights sporadically illuminated the 7,000 faces around him.</p><p>Tan, a solo video game developer, was just 20 years old. Yet a trailer for his game, Way to the Woods, was about to share screen time with dozens of other coming Xbox titles, including those from mega-franchises like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/arts/video-games/gears-of-war-judgment-and-the-writing-of-its-narrative.html" title="">Gears of War</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/technology/halo-infinite-xbox.html" title="">Halo</a>. Unlike those games, created by teams of hundreds with eight- or nine-figure budgets, Tan had built his alone in his spare time, buoyed by grant funding.</p><p>By the time he sat down in the theater at Microsoft’s annual hype-building event, in June 2019, Tan had watched his trailer more than 100 times. He knew every note, every camera pan. As the lights dimmed and the screen faded to black, he was too nervous to look. Everyone else watched his game’s stars — a deer and a fawn — appear onscreen, pushing a railway handcar across a golden plain.</p></div></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDjbZyvvyu0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Even before the event was over, Tan’s phone blew up with Twitter messages from strangers. Millions of people had been watching the livestream online. Some praised the game’s art style, which Tan said was inspired by the Studio Ghibli movies “Princess Mononoke” and “Spirited Away”; others were intrigued by its unusual main characters.</p></div><div><div><p>Tan was now shaking from adrenaline, not nerves.</p><p>“It was absolutely exhilarating,” he said.</p><p>Tan’s game about animals navigating an abandoned world had struck a chord. The final seconds of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDjbZyvvyu0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his stylish, mysterious trailer</a> made a promise, or as close to one as the world of video game development allows: “Coming 2020 … for real this time.”</p><p>More than five years later, and nine years after it was conceived, Way to the Woods remains unreleased. It has been so long that even steadfast supporters have begun to speculate that Tan may have abandoned the game altogether. But Tan wants you to know it is still coming. It is just that on the journey, he got lost for a little while.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Way to the Woods will let players solve puzzles while navigating deer through a world devoid of human life.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Tan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-63560f5a">‘It Was a Facade’</h2><p>Tan was born in Australia and grew up inside, and around, Melbourne’s public housing Towers. His mother, Thanh, and father, Khuong, immigrated from Vietnam in 1994. His older brother was born the same year.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Tan’s father would regale him with harrowing stories from his own youth: He broke out of prison after having been detained by the North Vietnamese during the war. He survived pirate attacks on refugee boats. His own father was a spy.</p><p>But for much of Tan’s childhood, Khuong was in and out of hospitals for dialysis and surgeries because of diabetes. The indie video games that Tan was drawn to — <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/limbo-review" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Limbo</a>, a suffocating 2-D platforming puzzle game, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/mar/13/journey-ps3-review" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Journey</a>, where you control a nameless robed figure’s trek to a distant mountain — were melancholic and contemplative, dealing with loneliness and isolation but touching on companionship and hope.</p><p>Tan was designing games himself from a young age. Around 2009, when he was 10, he used Adobe Flash and RPG Maker, a development tool kit for role-playing games, to make solo projects filled with inside jokes and memes that made his friends laugh. The games took a few hours to create and could be beaten in minutes.</p><p>As he upgraded to Unity, a more advanced 3-D game engine, his concepts grew larger without deviating from their comic origins.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Modern Bugfare 3, which Tan made as a teenager, helped him get a job building 3-D models for a video game studio.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Tan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>In 2014, Tan created a sequel to Modern Bugfare 2: The Desolation of Seinfeld, a role-playing game inspired by a cult film — <a href="https://collider.com/bee-movie-memes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that comedian’s “Bee Movie”</a> — and <a href="https://modernbugfare2.tumblr.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an absurdist Tumblr web comic</a>. “It was this two-hour R.P.G. where you play as Jerry Seinfeld trying to get his human body back,” he said.</p></div><div><div><p>When Tan posted two screenshots to Reddit showing a bulbous, frowning bee hovering inside a sunlit cabin, strangers online praised his work and provided tips to improve his technique. Some were envious that his jokey game looked better than their more serious creations.</p><p>One of those strangers was Alex Schwartz, the founder of the game studio Owlchemy Labs. Schwartz, who uses they/them pronouns, thought that Tan’s work was “dripping with aesthetic” and that his 3-D modeling was “beautiful and soft.” It was exactly the style they were looking for.</p><p>They offered Tan a job to help build 3-D models for a prototype that would become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-job-simulator" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Job Simulator</a>, a virtual reality title in which players take on everyday roles like office worker and auto mechanic. Tan was 15, in his third year of high school. His mother had to sign the work-for-hire contract.</p><p>While Tan worked for Owlchemy, he kept developing his own art, occasionally posting screenshots on DeviantArt and Reddit. One of his ideas — a deer standing in front of a giant robot — materialized in a dream. When he woke up, he sketched it out. He built it in Unreal Engine, a popular software development tool by Epic Games.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The early screenshots of Way to the Woods, including one that recreated an environment illustrated by the artist Vasili Zorin, spread widely on the gaming internet.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Tan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>In late 2015, Tan dropped several screenshots of “a little game idea” into the Unreal Engine subreddit. The stills featured a deer in what seemed to be a building’s abandoned restroom. Plants had started to grow through the tiles in the floor. The animal looked offscreen inquisitively or, perhaps, fearfully.</p></div><div><div><p>The post was spotted by Sean Murray, the lead developer for his own studio’s hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/all-alone-in-no-mans-sky" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No Man’s Sky</a>, a sci-fi survival game in which players traverse a simulated universe containing billions of planets. When Murray posted on Twitter about Tan’s work, it spread even further.</p><p>More than a million views and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/1/20/10790644/way-to-the-woods-anthony-tan-interview-reddit" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a feature on the culture website Polygon</a> later, Tan’s idea was officially on the map. Tan’s parents were supportive but did not quite grasp just how much of a sensation he had become.</p><p>Tan was 16 and, at that point, Way to the Woods was not a video game at all. It was a series of beautifully rendered images that were no more playable than the Mona Lisa.</p><p>“It was a facade,” Tan said. “It looks like something, but it isn’t something<em>.</em>”</p><p>There was no plot, no story line, no gameplay loop to keep players interested. There was a basic premise: Players would navigate the deer through a three-dimensional world devoid of human life, solving puzzles by capturing light in the larger animal’s antlers and using it to clear away shadow.</p><p>But turning the painting into a bona fide video game would take work. A lot of work. “I was pretty ignorant at the time at how much work I needed to actually do,” Tan said.</p></div></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/arts/SOLO-DESIGNER-cover-still/SOLO-DESIGNER-cover-still-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/arts/SOLO-DESIGNER-cover-still/SOLO-DESIGNER-cover-still-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/08/16/122360_1_SOLO-DESIGNER-Video-Clip-FINAL_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Turning a series of beautifully rendered images into a playable game has been time-consuming for Anthony Tan, who must be writer, artist and programmer.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><div><p>It is a fairly typical path into game development to take on a small, specific role as a contractor inside a larger studio and contribute to the whole. Watch the credit sequence in any multimillion-dollar video game like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/arts/television/19duty.html" title="">Call of Duty</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/arts/zelda-tears-kingdom-aonuma-fujibayashi.html" title="">The Legend of Zelda</a> and you will see hundreds of names listed across design, art, music and testing.</p><p>As a solo developer, Tan’s greatest challenge is acquiring and wielding the skills of an entire studio. It takes time to move from brush to pen to keyboard; from writer to artist to to programmer. The farming life simulation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/fashion/pastoral-living-in-stardew-valley-mesmerized-by-a-online-game.html" title="">Stardew Valley</a>, developed entirely by Eric Barone, took more than four years to put together. One of this year’s indie success stories, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/arts/dunkey-animal-well-bigmode.html" title="">Animal Well</a>, was a seven-year odyssey for Billy Basso.</p><p>Schwartz said Tan’s method for designing Way to the Woods — starting with the visual aesthetic rather than the gameplay — was unorthodox. When Schwartz provided advice after Tan left Owlchemy, they were surprised by his ambitious timelines.</p><p>“Every time I would talk to him,” Schwartz said, “he’s like, ‘I’m about a year away.’”</p><h2 id="link-43a29a9">‘It’s About Wonder’</h2><p>The buzz around Way to the Woods had sharpened Tan’s doubts about the quality of his game. He wanted players to experience what he had experienced playing Journey. He so badly wanted to give them goose bumps — he just wasn’t sure how. He realized he was trying to please everybody.</p><p>“I didn’t feel like I had anything authentic inside of me,” Tan said. “I didn’t know how to write anything. And I didn’t know what I wanted to say.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>But while Tan toiled over Way to the Woods, he was also growing up.</p><p>He was building the game’s trailer in early 2019 when his father had to have a leg amputated. By that time, his parents had separated. As Khuong Tan was getting used to his new wheelchair and prosthetics, he tripped and fell in his apartment. The accident ended his life. When Tan discusses his father’s death, he sounds almost incredulous. “It is so mundane,” he said. “I thought it was kind of funny, like … he survived pirates!”</p><p>Tan had been riding high ever since his breakthrough moment on Reddit. Way to the Woods had received funding from Epic Games, which makes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/arts/what-is-fortnite-battle-royale-nyt.html" title="">Fortnite</a>. He had caught the attention of Xbox’s independent developer program, tapping into its vast resources. He had begun a new relationship.</p><p>But after his father’s death — just a month before his trailer debuted at the Xbox briefing — and then the loss of a friend, Tan felt “paralyzed” and became hyperaware of his own mortality. He did not even know if he wanted to finish making the game.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tan said the art style for Way to the Woods was inspired by the Studio Ghibli movies “Princess Mononoke” and “Spirited Away.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Tan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>As Tan weathered the emotional storm, he began thinking about the message he wanted to deliver. In 2020, he wrote the entire story of Way to the Woods while looking at a photo of his father.</p><p>Tan cannot remember exactly what his father was holding in that photo: an old cathode-ray monitor, a slab of beer, maybe something else entirely. There is a dreamlike quality to his recollection. But his father is smiling. The image inspired a sentimentality in Tan, an acknowledgment of his bond with his father and an appreciation for objects we often take for granted.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“These simple things are as fulfilling as the biggest thing you could possibly imagine,” Tan said.</p><p>Way to the Woods is littered with relics of the world that came before, one inhabited by humans. Tan elevates the status of lamps, flip phones and, yes, bulky computer monitors, by making them central to the journey. He hopes the player will feel the sense of wonder and awe that the deer do when encountering these unfamiliar objects.</p><p>Tan also had to reconcile with parts of himself that he did not like. The teenager whose screenshots of deer had drawn so much attention was “irony-pilled” and “internet-memey,” he said. He got introspective, expunging the kind of edgy humor you might find on the online message board 4chan but maintaining the playful, silly streak of his earlier games. Internet memes were out; a little more sincerity came in.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I didn’t feel like I had anything authentic inside of me,” Tan said. “I didn’t know how to write anything. And I didn’t know what I wanted to say.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristoffer Paulsen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>He was not interested in creating something ironic or melancholic. He was interested in joy.</p><p>“I tried so hard to make a meaningful, artistic, Journey-type experience,” Tan said. “And I’ve just ended up back at ‘I built some silly shit.’ And that, to me, also feels more true and more meaningful.”</p><p>Tan decided to lean into the giddy experience of traversing a world as an animal, one that could be seen as both majestic and ungainly.</p><p>The shift is acutely highlighted by the game’s soundtrack. Aivi &amp; Surasshu, the music duo behind the soundtrack for the TV series “Steven Universe,” said its earliest draft for Way to the Woods had an oppressive tone. The pieces were more somber; the atmosphere pervading the game world more haunting. “Over time, both the game and the music started becoming more light,” Aivi said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Some fans lost hope as Tan publicized release dates — 2019, 2020, 2023 (“pinky swear!”) — and then missed them, but he never lost the support of Microsoft. Chris Charla, the general manager of Xbox’s independent developer program, said the company was understanding when independent studios announced delays. “Developers put themselves under enough pressure, and we’re not interested in micromanaging ship dates,” he said.</p><p>For Tan, the development journey led him all the way back to the beginning. He was making a video game with the sensibilities of the projects he used to craft in his bedroom. Or Modern Bugfare 3, with its soft lighting, whimsical textures and absurd attitude.</p><p>That is not to say his biggest project is insincere. “It’s about care and it’s about wonder and those feelings and finding ways for that to be told through these deer,” Tan said. It is no longer trying to be something for someone else. Way to the Woods is all grown up.</p><p>Several months ago, Tan once again addressed the question hovering over him: When can people expect to play his deer game? He said he had recently crafted the ending and was working through a checklist of tasks. He was discussing release windows with publishers.</p><p>This time, he would not put a date on it.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
