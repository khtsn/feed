After nine years of confronting Donald Trump and facing a MAGA movement that has remade the Republican Party I once belonged to, I believe that fear may be sufficient to beat Trump, but only joy can push MAGA back to the periphery of American life.</p><p>Let me begin with a confession I suspect many of us could make: I did not expect Kamala Harris to do so well, so soon in her contest with Trump. I did not expect the overflow, exuberant crowds, and I definitely did not expect to see such an immediate and effective pivot from the Biden message of “save democracy” to a Harris campaign that is so plainly emphasizing optimism and hope.</p><p>When evaluating American politics and culture, you can sometimes feel the mood shifting before it’s reflected in the data. That was certainly true at the beginning of the Trump era. If you were too deeply embedded in the polls when Trump announced his presidential bid in 2015, you probably snickered at Trump’s campaign.</p><p>He had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/20/even-the-firm-that-hired-actors-to-cheer-trumps-campaign-launch-had-to-wait-to-be-paid/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid actors</a> in Trump Tower in case no one else showed up. His <a href="https://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech</a> was strange — it didn’t just include the now-famous claim that Mexico was sending its rapists across the border, it also included bizarre asides, like a claim that other candidates “sweated like dogs.” The tone and the content that are familiar to us now seemed disqualifying in the moment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yet the American mood was far more populist than most political observers realized. Rare is the pundit who saw both Trump winning the Republican nomination and Bernie Sanders presenting a credible challenge to Hillary Clinton. Trump’s campaign initially seemed more like a bid for attention than a credible campaign for president. The Democratic primaries were supposed to be more of a coronation than a contest. But soon enough, the data started to match the mood, and angry populism was upon us.</p><p>I’m wondering if the mood is shifting again. I wonder if we’re on the front end of a change in national temperament that could be fatal for MAGA — if we’re leaving the era of the nasty snarl in favor of the broad smile. And it’s not just the Harris surge that’s made me wonder about this.</p><p>I’m struck, for example, by the spirit of joy that surrounded the Olympics. The opening moments of the games threatened to pull us down into the divisive mud. The controversy surrounding the opening ceremony and a performance that looked more than a little bit like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/sports/olympics-opening-ceremony-last-supper-paris.html" title="">parody version of Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper</a> caused the culture warriors to gear up for online combat. But the fight fizzled, quickly. The rest of America was too busy watching Snoop Dogg.</p><p>I don’t want to make too much of two weeks of Simone Biles’s greatness, Steph Curry’s shotmaking or Katie Ledecky’s dominance, but I felt a spirit of fun and exuberance around the Games that was qualitatively different from what we experienced in Tokyo in 2021 or Rio in 2016. Ratings were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/media/paris-olympics-ratings-nbc-peacock-viewership-streaming/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up 82 percent from the Tokyo Games</a>, and Americans were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/nbc-enjoys-paris-olympics-success-americans-neglect-work-watch-games-2024-08-01/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">neglecting work</a> to watch the events.</p><p>It’s also interesting that traffic to political websites is in steep decline. The website The Righting tracks traffic numbers to leading news sites, and <a href="https://therighting.com/traffic-reports/truth-social-traffic-nosedives-for-third-straight-month/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">month</a> after <a href="https://therighting.com/traffic-reports/news-websites-endure-traffic-tailspin-in-may/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">month</a> after <a href="https://therighting.com/traffic-reports/more-traffic-woes-for-news-websites-as-election-year-traffic-plummets-in-april/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">month</a> the numbers tell the same story — traffic is much lower than it was at the same time during our last presidential cycle. Yes, 2020 was a dramatic year, but so is 2024, and public interest in the news just isn’t the same. It’s not even close.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>I’d like to offer a theory. Partisans aren’t really shifting their mood, but the exhausted majority of Americans is, and right now the Harris campaign is much closer than Trump’s to capturing their desires and reflecting that mood.</p><p>The term “exhausted majority” comes from More in Common’s seminal “<a href="https://hiddentribes.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hidden Tribes</a>” survey of American life. I’ve written about this study a number of times, in part because it describes better than any other survey I’ve seen the fundamental cultural reality of American division — most of us really don’t like it. While the partisan 33 percent of America is engaged in the political equivalent of trench warfare, the exhausted 67 percent are tired of polarization, feel forgotten by the political parties and long for some degree of compromise.</p><p>For most of the last nine years, the polarized wings have tried to reach these exhausted and alienated voters largely by grabbing them by the lapels and demanding that they wake up to the imminent collapse of the American republic. The messages have been relentless: Trump will destroy American democracy; Joe Biden will make America Marxist.</p><p>What’s even more frustrating to partisans is that many of these exhausted Americans are so alienated that they’re often utterly indifferent to the merits of the arguments themselves. It’s almost beside the point that there’s infinitely more evidence of Trump’s threat to democracy than there is of Biden’s Marxism. Rather than adjudicating, say, Trump’s continued claims that the 2020 election was stolen, many members of the exhausted majority look at the battle over the vote and don’t think, “Why won’t Trump stop lying” and instead say to themselves, “When will they both just shut up?”</p><p>If the two parties continue on this path, a grim fight between two apocalyptic parties’ visions could result in an election outcome — in either direction — that doesn’t alter the fundamental political realities of American life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But there’s another potential outcome. If the national mood is shifting and if Harris and Tim Walz can maintain their happy warrior posture, then we could see meaningful political change. The era of the snarl could be at an end, and MAGA is nothing without its snarl.</p><p>I’m nervous about offering an optimistic take on American politics. Optimism can age very poorly, very quickly — and this idea might age just as poorly as the thought after the assassination attempt against Trump that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/opinion/trump-assassination-hope.html" title="">might have changed</a>, to have become a bit more reflective and humane after his brush with death.</p><p>But I’m optimistic nonetheless. Joy alone isn’t sufficient to defeat Trump. The best approach combines joy with tenacity and an appealing set of policies. But it’s plain, to me at least, that Harris’s joy seems to have caught the Trump campaign off guard. Even worse, Trump simply can’t pivot to match the spirit of the moment. He’s too mired in his own grievances and rage. He says he’s “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-press-conference-9af8036585d6727b6bb07008c0690cdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very angry</a>” at Harris. He says he’s “entitled to personal attacks.” So, no, MAGA can’t answer a smile with a smile. It can only answer with a snarl.</p><p>And it can try to wipe the smile off Harris’s face.</p><p>Politics will never be described as kind, and the Democrats are fully capable of their own abuses (the jokes about JD Vance having sex with a couch are ridiculous and juvenile), but there is simply no bottom to MAGA talk. There is no bottom to MAGA behavior. And when normal people are subjected to an avalanche of lies and personal insults, the temptation to respond with rage — and to demand that others be angry as well — can be overwhelming.</p><p>I remember well the closing days of Bob Dole’s 1996 campaign against Bill Clinton. He attacked Clinton’s character, highlighted various campaign finance scandals, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4913931/dole-outrage" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and demanded to know</a>: “Where is the outrage in the media? Where is the outrage? There’s no outrage!” But the American people didn’t want to be mad. The country was peaceful. It was prosperous. And the American people (including most voters) couldn’t be made to care about Clinton’s scandals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For nine years, Trump opponents have tried to make Americans care about Trump’s scandals. I’ve done it myself, constantly reminding readers that Trump’s misconduct doesn’t just disqualify him from the presidency; he also rightfully faces criminal charges, and no person who’s done what Trump’s done should run any institution, much less the executive branch of the United States government.</p><p>But you can’t make people care. And you certainly can’t make them share your anger. You can, however, meet them where they are. If they are ready for joy, then give them joy. I can think of few ends more fitting for MAGA than finally defeating it with joy rather than anger and teaching the next generation of American politicians that the best way to reach American hearts is with faith and hope rather than rage and fear.</p><hr/><p><strong>Some other things I did</strong></p><p>I spent time talking with my colleague Kristina Samulewski <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/opinion/harris-trump-conservatives.html?" title="">on our new Opinions podcast</a> about how a pro-life conservative could possibly vote for Kamala Harris:</p><blockquote><p>I’m an evangelical Christian, and I’ve been pro-life for reasons related both to my faith and to my understanding of science and justice. And it was one of the primary reasons why I continued my affiliation with the Republican Party, because of the Republican Party’s consistent commitment to a pro-life position.</p><p>But with the rise of Donald Trump, I was very, very concerned about his effect. Abortions went up under his presidency, and since the Dobbs decision, the pro-life movement has been in a state of political collapse. It’s not even been able to win a referendum in a red state. Trump was the very first president since Carter to end his presidency with a higher abortion rate and ratio and tens of thousands of more abortions.</p></blockquote><p>Speaking of rage and fear, I dedicated my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/opinion/christianity-evangelicals-persecution-faith.html" title="">Sunday column</a> to discussing the widespread sense in evangelical America that Christians are persecuted in the United States. The concern that the church might face a crackdown — and that Christianity is under attack — is a key element of the evangelical connection to Donald Trump. They believe he is saving them from a terrible fate. But is this correct?</p><blockquote><p>After living inside and outside conservative evangelicalism, I have a different view. While injustice is real, the Christian persecution narrative is fundamentally false. America isn’t persecuting Christians; it’s living with the fallout of two consequential constitutional mistakes that distort our politics and damage our culture.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, I wrote about legal developments that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/opinion/ucla-harvard-protests-rulings.html" title="">have put universities on notice</a> that they cannot permit the same kind of disruptive protests on campus this year that occurred last year:</p><blockquote><p>As the new school year approaches, it presents a second chance to do the right thing. Campus unrest has now cost three Ivy League presidents their jobs. The presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/columbia-president-nemat-shafik-resigns.html" title="">Columbia University</a> have resigned under pressure. And — as the decisions against Harvard and U.C.L.A. make clear — campus unrest may result in severe legal and financial penalties against universities that fail to maintain order or fail to protect speech.</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>David French is an Opinion columnist, writing about law, culture, religion and armed conflict.
