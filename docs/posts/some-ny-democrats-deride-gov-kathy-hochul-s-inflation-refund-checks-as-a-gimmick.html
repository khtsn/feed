Kathy Hochul’s focus on affordability in her recently enacted budget mostly went over well with her Democratic colleagues in the State Legislature.</p><p>But the decision to spend $2 billion on one-time “inflation refund” checks for about eight million New York households — one of the largest and most tactile components of the multibillion dollar package — has been derided by some Democratic legislators as a stunt that is more about politics than good policy.</p><p>“New Yorkers know a gimmick when they see one,” said State Senator James Skoufis, a Hudson Valley Democrat.</p><p>The checks will <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/inflation-refund-checks.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">range from $150 to $400</a>, with individuals who make less than $150,000 receiving $150 or $200, and married joint filers who make up to $300,000 receiving $300 or $400. The limits are based on adjusted gross income from 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We’re going to give it back directly — no red tape, no hoops to jump through, just giving you that check,” Ms. Hochul said at an event this week.</p><p>The final budget, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/nyregion/hochul-budget-new-york.html" title="">which passed last week</a>, also included many of her other proposals: billions in funding for child care, infrastructure and an expansion of free school lunch statewide, as well as tax cuts for middle-class and low-income residents and a generous increase of the state’s child tax credit.</p><p>Those initiatives survived the usual haggling between Ms. Hochul and legislative leaders. But the refund check proposal, initially $3 billion, was chiseled in negotiations to $2 billion.</p><p>When Ms. Hochul <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/tax-refund-ny-hochul.html" title="">proposed</a> the checks late last year, she explained that the state had extra money because higher prices on goods caused by inflation had led to higher-than-expected sales tax revenue. As a result, she said, she wanted to send up to $500 to joint filers and up to $300 to individuals. Legislators ultimately agreed to send smaller checks.</p><p>Mr. Skoufis, for his part, introduced legislation this week to bar Ms. Hochul from putting her name, photo or signature on the largess, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/politics/stimulus-check-trump-signature.html" title="">President Trump did</a> with the stimulus checks distributed to millions of Americans in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“No governor should have the opportunity for this kind of self-promotion,” Mr. Skoufis said.</p><p>Avi Small, Ms. Hochul’s press secretary, said the design of the checks has not been finalized but rejected Mr. Skoufis’s characterization of the checks as a “gimmick.”</p><p>“The governor’s signature won’t be on the checks, so the senator’s time would be better spent on the issues that actually matter to his constituents,” he said.</p><p>Despite the skepticism from some corners, Democrats recognized that the program was a priority for Ms. Hochul, who is up for re-election next year and facing several potential challengers from both parties, including Representative Elise Stefanik, a Trump ally. Public polling <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/2025/04/22/hochul-sees-jump-in-favorability-approval-re-elect-ratings-favorability-rating-44-43-barely-positive-first-time-since-january-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continues to show</a> that voters have a lukewarm view of the governor even as they broadly support much of her policy agenda.</p><p>Carl Heastie, the assembly speaker, who is a Democrat, expressed support for the plan. “These checks will put money back into the pockets of New Yorkers, allowing them to save or spend in a way that makes sense for them,” he said in a statement.</p><p>The initiative is part of a state budget that is counting on tens of billions of dollars in federal aid. The Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/nyregion/trump-budget-new-york.html" title="">promise of sweeping cuts</a> has compounded New York legislators’ belief that the governor’s move was bad policy in a fraught moment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There is almost unanimous agreement that Ms. Hochul, who has been critical of Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans for their proposed cuts, will need to call a special legislative session to reckon with the effects of whatever <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/nyregion/salt-tax-deduction.html" title="">passes in Washington</a>.</p><p>In anticipation of the shortfalls, legislators and budget experts said Ms. Hochul should have held the surplus in reserve or crafted a more targeted policy, such as a temporary earned-income tax credit.</p><p>“We are ignoring the massive elephant in the room — pun intended — with every statement out of the White House threatening tens of billions of dollars that flow to this state,” said State Senator Pat Fahy, a Democrat representing Albany. “So we do need to be prudent.”</p><p>Ms. Fahy said she supported helping families who were struggling, “but we’ve got to target what are increasingly scarce resources and not also give this money out to the high earners.”</p><p>The state’s Department of Taxation and Finance has the capacity to send out about a million checks per week. Ms. Hochul has said the checks will start arriving by mail in October to about eight million households, including about 3.5 million in New York City.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“When it comes time to be shopping for fall, school clothes and supplies,” Ms. Hochul said, “it’s going to be $400 right here — that’s what we’re doing for families.”</p><p>Since becoming governor in 2021, Ms. Hochul has organized several other direct payment programs, albeit on a smaller scale. One was a direct one-time payment to about 2.4 million homeowners, averaging about $800.</p><p>Those checks included a message from “Governor Hochul and the New York State Legislature.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Oreskes is a reporter covering New York State politics and government for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
