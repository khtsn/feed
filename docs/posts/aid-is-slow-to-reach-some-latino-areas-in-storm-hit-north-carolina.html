Carolina mobile home park where she lives, she sprang into action. She waved it down and began translating for the group of Spanish speakers gathering behind her.</p><p>“Quién ocupa agua?” Ms. Salgado called out. “Pañales para los bebés?” (“Who needs water? Diapers for the babies?”)</p><p>Inside the truck were a family from Georgia who had raced to North Carolina as soon as they learned of the devastation left by Hurricane Helene. They took their cues from Ms. Salgado, and tried to communicate with the residents in broken Spanish. “Agua, aquí,” one man said, handing out bottled water to eager families.</p><p>A close-knit group of immigrants from Mexico and Central America live at the mobile home park, known as Alan Campos. Many residents of the park, on a side road between the hard-hit towns of Black Mountain and Swannanoa, barely escaped with their lives after torrents of water came rushing into their trailers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A large group of families, many with young children, remain without flushing water or reliable cellphone serviceon Thursday, and electricity remains spotty. Those whose homes are still intact have taken other families in, with one three-bedroom trailer now housing about 12 people.</p><p>“We don’t have a lot right now,” Ms. Salgado said, “but we have each other.”</p><p>Aid has begun to flow into some of the most ravaged parts of western North Carolina, nearly a week after the region was inundated by Helene. But the challenges of getting assistance to non-English-speaking communities like the one at Alan Campos remain steep.</p><p>Margarita Ramirez, the executive director of Centro Unido, a Latino advocacy group in Marion, N.C., said that organizations like hers were rushing into immigrant communities to help bridge language and other barriers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Part of Blue Ridge Road near Swannanoa was washed out when heavy rain from Tropical Storm Helene flooded the Swannanoa River. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maria Navarro, left, and Maria Salgado in the Alan Campos Mobile Home Park, where they live </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Diego Reyes for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Many Latino residents are not receiving information in Spanish about where to go to obtain aid from FEMA and other government agencies. And those who lack legal documents to live and work in the United States tend to avoid the authorities in general, for fear of deportation.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Hundreds of Spanish speakers are showing up at Centro Unido’s offices to report missing loved ones or get help filling out FEMA paperwork, Ms. Ramirez said.</p><p>“More than a 1,000 people have come by and we are not done yet,” she said on Wednesday. “We are printing fliers in Spanish, telling them where they can go to ask for help. The need is great.”</p><p>Outreach to the region’s Latino population has never been more important, advocates said. The population of Latinos has exploded in North Carolina; they are the fastest growing demographic group in the state, numbering about 1.1 million, or 11.4 percent of the population, according to the census.</p><p>Ms. Ramirez believes the actual figure is much larger. “Many in our community are still afraid of filling out the census forms,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the hard-hit western region, Henderson County’s population is slightly more than 10 percent Hispanic, according to census figures; in Buncombe County, which includes Asheville and the Alan Campos park, the figure is just over 7 percent.</p><p>Migrants from countries like Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras are coming to western North Carolina for jobs on apple and peach farms, in tomato fields and supermarket warehouses. Living expenses in the area are affordable, advocates for the migrants said, compared with those in migrant magnets like Florida, Texas and California.</p><p>Ms. Salgado, 44, a Mexican immigrant, said she had seen the Latino community in the Alan Campos park grow over the last two decades, from a small group she could count on her hands to more than 100 households.</p><p>Ms. Salgado, who used to live in Miami, followed her husband in the early 2000s to North Carolina, where he had found employment in tobacco fields. She landed a job of her own as a cleaner.</p><p>They purchased a three-bedroom mobile home for $19,000. Every morning since then, she said, she woke up to breathtaking views of green mountains and flowing rivers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hermila Contreras Ortiz’s home in the mobile home park was completely destroyed by a storm-felled tree.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Diego Reyes for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents and friends worked on Tuesday to help clear debris. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Diego Reyes for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It was a good, quiet life here,” she said. “There are plenty of jobs and cheaper houses.”</p><p>Isabel Lobo, 47, and her longtime partner, Isaias Chicas, 50, moved to the park from El Salvador seven years ago. Ms. Lobo found work as a forklift operator at a warehouse for the local grocery chain, Ingles, and Mr. Chicas took a job as a dishwasher at a local senior center. They recently finished paying off their $35,000 mountainside mobile home.</p><p>“We thought we had found our perfect home here,” Ms. Lobo said. “Our home was paid. Now, we were going to enjoy our lives.”</p><p>That hope was shattered last Friday when the ferocious storm caused flooding that devoured countless vulnerable structures in its path. Families like the Salgados and Lobos are unsure now of how or when they will be able to return to work, because their places of employment were overwhelmed by the gushing floodwaters as well, and were badly damaged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Like most trailer owners in the area, they did not have property insurance. A new trailer now would cost about $80,000, they estimate.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, Ms. Salgado is staying with a brother who lives in a trailer nearby, where they must haul water from a nearby river to flush the toilets. Ms. Lobos and Mr. Chicas are staying with friends in the same park.</p><p>Earlier this week, Ms. Salgado stood outside her trailer and surveyed the damage. She pointed at a new white sofa she had recently purchased for $1,000, and a table that cost $300.</p><p>“All gone,” she said in Spanish. “I can’t believe we are going to have to start all over again.”</p><p>Ana Cordova, 30, a newer immigrant from El Salvador with two children, ages 13 and 3, said she felt welcomed by longtime residents like Ms. Salgado, who introduced her to the larger Spanish-speaking community.</p><p>On the day that the volunteers from Georgia arrived, Ms. Cordova marveled that “Americanos” would go out of their way to help people like her, who often feel maligned in the heated political debate over immigration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Thank you,” Mr. Cordova mustered in English as she collected water and canned food.</p><p>She then turned to some of the immigrants around her, and said in Spanish. “Isn’t it nice for the Americanos to help us? It does not matter to them that we are migrants.”</p><p>Cheryl Dupont, one of the volunteers, said that police officers at a nearby service station had pointed them toward the mobile home park when they asked for places where they could help. “They told us that if we were to come up here, that there was a lot of need, because nobody’s been here yet,” she said over the sounds of people yelling ,“Agua! Agua!” as they surrounded the truck.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As soon as power was restored and he could charge his cellphone, Valentin Salgado called his parents in Mexico.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Diego Reyes for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Clothes and shoes dried in the sun outside a home in the park.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Diego Reyes for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Glimmers of hope arrived on Wednesday afternoon when power returned to some of the trailers.

He tried to avoid showing them the trailers that had been smashed by fallen trees, or the trash piled on overstuffed cans that was spreading bad odors and misery in the park.</p><p>“The children are happy — they are playing,” he told them, straining to maintain a smile. “They know that it rained, but they don’t know about the hurricane. We don’t want to traumatize them.”</p><p>The boy and girl, 6 and 3, smiled shyly as their grandparents waved goodbye.</p><p>“We are going to be OK, don’t worry,” Mr. Salgado said as his parents disappeared from the screen.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edgar Sandoval covers Texas for The Times, with a focus on the Latino community and the border with Mexico.
