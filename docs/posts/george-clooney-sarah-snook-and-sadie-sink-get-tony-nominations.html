The contenders are “Buena Vista Social Club,” about a group of beloved Cuban musicians; “Dead Outlaw,” which tells the strange story of a train robber whose corpse became an attraction; “Death Becomes Her,” a stage adaptation of the film about two frenemies who take an immortality potion; “Maybe Happy Ending,” about a relationship between two robots; and “Operation Mincemeat,” about a bizarre World War II British intelligence operation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Oddly enough, three of the best musical contenders center on dead people — “Dead Outlaw” and “Operation Mincemeat” are both about corpses, and “Death Becomes Her” is about two undead women.</p><p>The race for best play also features five contenders: “English,” a Pulitzer-winning drama about a group of Iranians struggling to learn a new language; “The Hills of California,” about singing British sisters reuniting as their mother dies; “John Proctor Is the Villain,” about Georgia high school students reading “The Crucible” and seeing parallels in their own lives; “Oh, Mary!” a hit comedy ahistorically spoofing Mary Todd Lincoln, and “Purpose,” a family drama about a politically active Black family in Chicago.</p><p>The nominations are being announced in New York by the actors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/theater/sarah-paulson-appropriate-broadway.html?smid=url-share" title="">Sarah Paulson</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/theater/wendell-pierce-death-of-a-salesman.html?smid=url-share" title="">Wendell Pierce</a>. A few marquee categories were announced on “CBS Mornings,” with the remainder set to be revealed at 9 a.m. on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/tonyawards" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony Awards YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>The announcement begins a five-week scramble in which the 840 Tony voters — mostly people who work in theater or who help finance Broadway shows — will finish seeing the nominated shows so they can cast their ballots for the productions and performances they admired most.</p><p>The Tony Awards ceremony will take place on June 8 at Radio City Music Hall, hosted by Cynthia Erivo. It will be broadcast on CBS.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Broadway has lots to brag about this season: a bumper crop of 42 openings, an unusual number of movie stars treading the boards, several productions that are drawing young audiences and a mix of quirky and original shows alongside big-brand spectacle. But there are major challenges too: Ticket prices, especially for the hottest shows, have become out-of-reach for many, and profitability rates have plunged as the cost of producing has risen.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.tonyawards.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony Awards</a> are presented by the Broadway League and the American Theater Wing. This year, there were 21 plays and 21 musicals eligible for awards because they opened on Broadway between April 26, 2024, and April 27, 2025.</p><p>The nominees were chosen by a committee made up of people who have considerable knowledge about theater, but who do not work on, or have a financial interest in, any of the season’s shows. The committee started with 65 members, but because of recusals, 54 wound up participating in selecting the nominees.</p><p>Some noncompetitive awards have already been announced.</p><p>The actor Harvey Fierstein, a four-time Tony winner (for performing in “Torch Song Trilogy” and “Hairspray” and for writing “Torch Song Trilogy” and the book for “La Cage Aux Folles”), will receive the annual prize for lifetime achievement. The actress Celia Keenan-Bolger, a Tony winner for “To Kill a Mockingbird,” will receive the annual Isabelle Stevenson Award, which recognizes volunteerism.</p><p>This year’s Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theater are being given to “Great Performances,” the PBS arts program; Michael Price, the former executive director of Goodspeed Musicals in Connecticut; New 42, which runs rehearsal studios and a children’s theater on 42nd Street; and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Paulson is the theater reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
