Box office grosses are approaching prepandemic levels amid a bumper crop of 42 show openings. Several productions have drawn much-desired young audiences, and the season featured a mix of quirky and original shows alongside big-brand spectacle. But the industry faces challenges too: Ticket prices, especially for the hottest shows, have become out-of-reach for many, and fewer shows are turning a profit as the cost of producing has risen.</p><p>The closely watched race for best new musical, bizarrely enough, features three shows concerning dead bodies: “Dead Outlaw,” which tells the story of a train robber whose corpse became an attraction; “Operation Mincemeat,” about a strange-but-true World War II British intelligence operation involving disinformation planted on a corpse, and “Death Becomes Her,” a stage adaptation of the film about two undead frenemies. The other two contenders are “Buena Vista Social Club,” about the group of beloved Cuban musicians, and “Maybe Happy Ending,” about a relationship between two robots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Hue Park, who wrote “Maybe Happy Ending” with Will Aronson, said the nominations affirmed a stunning turnaround for the show. “We had a very rough start, and we were not sure if the show would stay running,” Park said. “Being an original story, not based on famous IP, was the biggest challenge in the beginning, but at the same time for that reason the entire theater community has tried to support us, and that is one of the main reasons the show is still surviving and getting these nominations.”</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><figcaption><span>Three new musicals tied for the most nominations, with 10 each: “Maybe Happy Ending,” “Buena Vista Social Club” and “Death Becomes Her.&#34; </span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The race for best play also features five contenders. “English,” Sanaz Toossi’s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, is about a group of Iranians struggling to learn a new language. Jez Butterworth’s “The Hills of California” follows a family of singing British sisters who reunite as their mother dies. In Kimberly Belflower’s “John Proctor Is the Villain,” Georgia high school students read “The Crucible” and see parallels in their own lives. Cole Escola ahistorically spoofs Mary Todd Lincoln in the hit comedy “Oh, Mary!” And Branden Jacobs-Jenkins tells the story of a politically active but feuding Black family in Chicago in “Purpose.”</p><p>Four new takes on classic shows were nominated for best musical revival, including “Gypsy,” “Pirates! The Penzance Musical,” “Sunset Boulevard” and “Floyd Collins.” The four nominees for best play revival are “Eureka Day,” “Our Town,” “Romeo + Juliet” and “Yellow Face.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.tonyawards.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony Awards</a> are presented by the Broadway League and the American Theater Wing. This year, there were 21 plays and 21 musicals eligible for awards because they opened on Broadway between April 26, 2024, and April 27, 2025.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a season when an unusual number of boldface names appeared on Broadway, several came away with nominations, including Darren Criss, Daniel Dae Kim and Bob Odenkirk. But a bevy of major stars failed to get nods from the nominators, including Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Nick Jonas, David Hyde Pierce and Idina Menzel.</p><p>The race for best lead actress in a musical is seen as having two front-runners: McDonald, who is giving a blistering performance of an out-of-control stage mother in “Gypsy,” and Nicole Scherzinger, a former Pussycat Doll making a rapturously received Broadway debut as a has-been movie star in “Sunset Boulevard.” The other nominees in that category include both stars of “Death Becomes Her,” Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard, as well as Jasmine Amy Rogers, who brings Betty Boop to life in “Boop! The Musical.”</p><p>The race for best lead actor in a musical is wide open, with six nominees, including Criss of “Maybe Happy Ending,” Andrew Durand of “Dead Outlaw,” Tom Francis of “Sunset Boulevard,” Jonathan Groff of “Just in Time,” James Monroe Iglehart of “A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical” and Jeremy Jordan of “Floyd Collins.”</p><p>Farrow, Sink and Snook are all included in the race for best lead actress in a play — Farrow as an Iowa divorcée whose life is upended when she takes in a tenant in “The Roommate,” Sink as an adolescent-with-secrets in “John Proctor Is the Villain” and Snook as 26 characters in a one-woman (plus camera crew) adaptation of “The Picture of Dorian Gray.” They will face off against LaTanya Richardson Jackson, playing a formidable family matriarch in “Purpose,” and Laura Donnelly, who, in “The Hills of California,” played a mother in the first act and her daughter, many years later, in the second.</p><p>In the best actor in a play category Escola, who imagines Mary Todd Lincoln as an alcoholic wannabe cabaret star, is considered a leading contender. Clooney is nominated for playing Edward R. Murrow in a stage adaptation of the film “Good Night, and Good Luck” that has been breaking box office records. The other nominees include Kim, for “Yellow Face,” Jon Michael Hill and Harry Lennix, for “Purpose,” and Louis McCartney, the 21-year-old star of “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” a spectacle-heavy stage prequel to the Netflix series. (Escola is nonbinary, but agreed to be considered in this category.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The nominations, in 26 categories, were announced in New York by the actors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/theater/sarah-paulson-appropriate-broadway.html?smid=url-share" title="">Sarah Paulson</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/theater/wendell-pierce-death-of-a-salesman.html?smid=url-share" title="">Wendell Pierce</a>. The nominations were spread out among 29 shows. Thirteen were shut out completely, including a starry revival of “Othello” (with Washington as Othello and Gyllenhaal as Iago) that has caused a stir by charging $921 for many orchestra seats.</p><p>The nominees were chosen by a committee made up of 54 people who have knowledge about theater, but who do not work on, or have a financial interest in, any of the season’s shows.</p><p>The announcement begins a five-week scramble in which the 840 Tony voters — mostly people who work in theater or who help finance Broadway shows — will finish seeing the nominated shows so they can cast their ballots for the productions and performances they admired most. The Tony Awards ceremony will take place on June 8 at Radio City Music Hall, hosted by Cynthia Erivo. It will be broadcast on CBS.</p><p>Tony Awards administrators announced that they would give special Tony Awards to the musicians in the “Buena Vista Social Club” band and to the illusions and special effects team behind “Stranger Things: The First Shadow.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Paulson is the theater reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
