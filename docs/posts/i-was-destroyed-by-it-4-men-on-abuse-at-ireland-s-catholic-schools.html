And then they spoke out in waves.</p><p>Over the past two years, dozens of people, mostly men in their 50s and 60s, have reported being sexually abused at schools run by Catholic orders in Ireland.</p><p>Their accounts only hint at the magnitude of a national scandal, experts say. In September, <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/42b7e-education-scoping-inquiry/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a preliminary government inquiry identified</a> almost 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse in religious schools between the 1960s and the 1990s, and 884 alleged abusers. Norma Foley, Ireland’s minister for education, said the scale of abuse was “truly shocking,” and has ordered a full government investigation.</p><p>While Ireland has long grappled with the legacy of abuse within Catholic church institutions, the latest revelations shed light on how dozens of schools allegedly harbored serial abusers for decades.</p><p>The fight for accountability has been led by a cohort of older men who are challenging taboos around sexual abuse, masculinity and shame.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Their numbers are so big, and the ripple effect of harm must bring some impact on broader Irish society,” said Tim Chapman, an academic and a practitioner of “restorative justice,” a process that helps people harmed by a crime to communicate with those responsible and to find some resolution.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>School mementoes belonging to John Coulter, who is part of a survivors’ group demanding answers about the abuse they suffered.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Faded school yearbooks belonging to Mark Vincent Healy, who was abused at St. Mary’s College, Dublin, between 1969 and 1973.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The reckoning began in 2021 when several <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/video/video/2022/11/16/blackrock-college-past-pupils-recount-experiences-of-abuse/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former students from</a> two private boys’ schools, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/video/video/2022/11/16/blackrock-college-past-pupils-recount-experiences-of-abuse/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Willow Park School and Blackrock College</a>, began discussing their experiences of abuse in a Facebook alumni group. The following year, Ireland’s national broadcaster <a href="https://www.rte.ie/radio/doconone/1333550-blackrock-boys" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RTÉ</a> aired a documentary called “Blackrock Boys” that featured the harrowing testimony of two brothers abused for years at the college.</p><p>Both Willow Park and Blackrock are run by a Roman Catholic order called the Spiritans. In November 2022, the leader of the Spiritans then, Father Martin Kelly, issued a <a href="https://www.blackrockcollege.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Public-Apology-by-Fr-Martin-Kelly.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">formal apology</a> to the victims at Blackrock, in which he said, “What was done to you as innocent children was cruel and indefensible.”</p><p>Since then, accounts have poured in from alumni of schools run by other Catholic orders in Ireland.</p><p>Mr. Chapman was first contacted by Blackrock survivors in 2021 and then was hired by the Spiritans to facilitate dialogue between the religious order and the survivors and victims of abuse. “As I often put it to these men, you can stand up for the child inside you,” he said. “Now, they can tell their story.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“In our time alone, there are 10 people that we now know were molesting, abusing, raping boys,” John Coulter said of his school experience. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>John Coulter attended Willow Park School and Blackrock College in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He has visceral memories of two priests, he said: one who molested students as he taught music, and another, a math teacher, who leaned students over the desks in class and rubbed himself on them. Mr. Coulter still remembers the smell of one man and the way spit would cling to the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Mr. Coulter was in the alumni Facebook group in 2021, when friends began recounting their experiences of abuse. “In our time alone, there are 10 people that we now know were molesting, abusing, raping boys,” he said.</p><p>As the scale of abuse became clear, the men decided they wanted to act. They established a nonprofit advocacy group, Restore Together, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2022/11/13/blackrock-college-who-were-the-priests-accused-of-abuse/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to collectively</a> demand accountability. As a result, the Spiritans are now funding counseling for survivors and are currently formalizing a financial reparations program.</p><p>“You get to your 60s or late 50s and maybe you’ve got a little bit more capacity for dealing with this,” Mr. Coulter said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cory McMahon said he was abused when he was just 12.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Corry McMahon was on the train between Dublin and its affluent southern suburbs when he saw an email with the Spiritans’ official apology to victims.

As a member of Restore Together, he and three classmates held a news conference in November 2022 to encourage others to come forward, helping break the taboo around speaking out.</p><p>“Picture a 12-year-old child that you know.
