Israel did not immediately comment.</p><p>The release followed several fraught days of negotiations, after Israel refused on Saturday to deliver 620 Palestinian prisoners whom it had agreed to exchange <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-hamas-ceasefire.html" title="">for six Israeli hostages</a>. Since late January, when the cease-fire went into effect, Israel and Hamas have been regularly exchanging hostages taken to Gaza for Palestinians in Israeli prisons.</p><p>After Hamas released the six Israelis on Saturday — most of them in performative events designed to show the militant group’s continued control in Gaza — Israel refused to free the Palestinian prisoners, saying it would not do so until Hamas committed to releasing more hostages and forgoing “humiliation ceremonies.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Before returning hostages, Hamas has often paraded them through shouting throngs of the group’s supporters, enraging Israeli officials. Last week, before Hamas handed over coffins said to contain the remains of four captives, the militant group staged a display with music and taunts aimed at the Israeli government. Volker Türk, the United Nations human rights chief, called the event “abhorrent and cruel.”</p><p>Israeli authorities had forensic teams present at the handover to attempt an initial identification of the bodies, the Health Ministry said, after which they would be taken to Israel’s Institute of Forensic Medicine.</p><p>Israel is expected to free the 620 Palestinian prisoners after it has confirmed the identities of the four returned bodies.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the deceased hostages Hamas said it released.</p><h2 id="link-3a15bae6">Shlomo Mansour</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shlomo Mansour was born in Iraq and migrated to Israel as a teen.
