Teachers rejoiced.</p><p>“I have more students in my class that have very limited English, and I feel like this has been a huge help for me, to help them and for them to be more comfortable in the environment,” said Suzanne Aruti, who teaches second grade at P.S. 135 in Queens. She said she has 20 students, down from the 32 she used to teach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For years, city officials and teachers sat on opposite sides of the debate over lowering class sizes. Teachers wanted the ability to give students more one-on-one attention, while the city felt that there were more cost-effective ways to improve education.</p><p>Now, two years into the effort to comply with the class-size law, the Department of Education has adopted a new approach: For the first time, schools were asked to create their own plans to lower class sizes and apply for funding to help them do so. Before, the D.O.E. used a formula designed by the State Legislature to send funding to schools identified as places where class sizes could be reduced.</p><p>The city’s teachers’ union, the United Federation of Teachers, proposed the change and collaborated with the principals’ union on the plan.</p><p>“Everybody understood it was probably the better way of doing it,” said Michael Mulgrew, the president of the teachers’ union. “It’s a really difficult challenge, but we keep moving through it.”</p><p>Enrollment in city schools dropped dramatically during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/nyregion/nyc-schools-enrollment-covid.html#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%20just%20over,from%20the%20Department%20of%20Education." title="">decreasing by 4.5 percent</a> between the fall of 2019 and the fall of 2021 — a loss of roughly 50,000 students. But the influx of migrant children into the school system made up for some of the losses, before evening out this year as migration has slowed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The increase in English language learners has only made the need for smaller class sizes more urgent, teachers said. Mr. Mulgrew agreed that smaller classes could help.</p><p>“New York City is facing an educational challenge that no school district has ever faced in the history of education, ever,” he said. “We have to figure this out on our own.”</p><p>The state gave city schools five years to lower their class sizes, with yearly benchmarks. This year, 40 percent of classes must be under the state’s new limits. Next year, that jumps to 60 percent.</p><p>Currently, 46 percent of classes meet the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/nyregion/nyc-schools-class-sizes.html#:~:text=Classes%20in%20New%20York%20City,the%202021%2D2022%20school%20year." title="">limits</a>, according to the D.O.E. — no more than 20 students per class for kindergarten through third grade, 23 students for fourth through eighth grade and 25 students for high school classes. The largest classes in the city currently have about 34 students.</p><p>Mr. Mulgrew said that the state would provide $300 million for this year’s efforts to shrink class sizes. More than 350 schools had applied for funding ahead of Friday’s deadline.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>According to the teachers’ union, the idea for schools to apply for the funding themselves came from Tracy Ivanic, a science teacher at P.S. 153 in Queens.</p><p>“I think having less students in a class is a better thing for all reasons: socially, emotionally, educationally,” said Ms. Ivanic, who has taught in city schools for 28 years.</p><p>One of the main challenges of smaller classes is space. According to the D.O.E., schools that don’t have the capacity to open up additional classrooms might have to move buildings, or enrollment at popular schools might need to be limited. City officials are still looking at solutions to those longer term challenges.</p><p>Randi Leibson, a special-education teacher at P.S. 78 on Staten Island, said she walked through the halls of her school, counting classrooms and adding up the number of teachers in the building, to put together her school’s application with her principal.</p><p>She said the plan was very popular among teachers and parents in her community.</p><p>“If we want students to learn, we need smaller class sizes, and we literally need them right now,” she said. “If you have large classes, that’s leading to stressed out students and stressed out teachers. We need the smaller class sizes so educators can teach.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Most schools will need to hire more staff members to cover the additional classes, according to the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, the city’s principals’ union.</p><p>“The city must provide recurring funding for additional staff, and the D.O.E. has expressed their commitment to do so,” Henry Rubio, the union’s president, said in a statement. “The city must continue to communicate with New York City families about the real challenges of reducing class sizes in certain communities.”</p><p>Shantae Jones, a librarian at P.S. 135, where Ms. Aruti also teaches, said that the key to keeping students engaged is meeting their individual needs. But in larger classes, it is almost impossible to make sure that all students are learning in their way at their pace, she said.</p><p>At Ms. Jones’s school, a campus that used to serve 1,500 students now serves only 700, because of citywide enrollment declines and the opening of new schools nearby. Still, the classes in the higher grades are at capacity, said Ms. Jones, who has taught for 28 years.</p><p>“This is a long time coming,” she said. “It is what teachers have asked for for many, many years, because they know the benefits of smaller class sizes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Aruti said that though her classes typically had more than 30 students, this year there were just 20, in compliance with state law.</p><p>The smaller class size enables her to check in with every student each day. Particularly at her school, which has a large population of migrant children and students who live at a local homeless shelter, the ability to provide more individualized attention has been transformative, she said.</p><p>“It’s been a game-changer, really,” she said. “It just makes it easier to teach.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Fahy reports on New York City and the surrounding area for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-fahy">More about Claire Fahy</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>20</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>When Class Sizes Had to Drop, New York City Schools Made It Work<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/new-york-city-department-of-education">New York City Department of Education</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/united-federation-of-teachers">United Federation of Teachers</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/2024/12/24/nyregion/nyc-schools-class-sizes.html">57</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/2024/12/24/nyregion/nyc-schools-class-sizes.html">57</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
