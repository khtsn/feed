Teachers rejoiced.</p><p>“I have more students in my class that have very limited English, and I feel like this has been a huge help for me, to help them and for them to be more comfortable in the environment,” said Suzanne Aruti, who teaches second grade at P.S. 135 in Queens. She said she has 20 students, down from the 32 she used to teach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For years, city officials and teachers sat on opposite sides of the debate over lowering class sizes. Teachers wanted the ability to give students more one-on-one attention, while the city felt that there were more cost-effective ways to improve education.</p><p>Now, two years into the effort to comply with the class-size law, the Department of Education has adopted a new approach: For the first time, schools were asked to create their own plans to lower class sizes and apply for funding to help them do so. Before, the D.O.E. used a formula designed by the State Legislature to send funding to schools identified as places where class sizes could be reduced.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
