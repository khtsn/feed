This is the eighth recall for the model.</p><p>The recall of about 46,000 vehicles includes all models that were manufactured from Nov. 13, 2023, when the Cybertruck was first produced, to Feb. 27. <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCLRPT-25V170-9407.PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a report</a> filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday, Tesla said that only about 1 percent of the electric vehicles from this model were defective but that it would recall all the vehicles as a precaution.</p><p>As of March 14, Tesla had identified 151 warranty claims that might be related to the trim panel issue, according to the report, but the company said it was “not aware of any collisions, fatalities or injuries that are or may be related to the condition.”</p><p>The announcement marks one of the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK#recalls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largest recalls</a> for Cybertrucks in the model’s short and at times flawed history on the road. Other issues with the vaunted model have included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/business/tesla-cybertruck-recall.html" title="">losing drive power</a>, its front-windshield wiper malfunctioning and an accelerator pedal getting stuck. Cybertrucks <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/cybertruck" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sell for about $80,000 to $100,000</a>, depending on customization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/recall-cybertruck-cantrail-replacement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has told drivers</a> that they may continue to drive their Cybertrucks until the company contacts them for a service appointment when parts become available in their regions.</p><p>Tesla first became aware of reports of a “partial delamination” of the stainless steel panel on Jan. 7, the report said. The cosmetic appliqué is known as the cant rail and is an “electrocoated steel stamping” joined to a stainless steel panel with an adhesive, the report said. The cant rail is then affixed to the Cybertruck with fasteners. On affected vehicles, the panel becomes unstuck at the adhesive joint.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The recent recall of the Tesla Cybertruck concerns a cosmetic appliqué that is joined to a stainless steel panel and could become detached, a safety report on the recall said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pete Kiehart for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“If the cant rail stainless steel panel separates from the vehicle while in drive, it could create a road hazard for following motorists and increase their risk of injury or a collision,” Tesla wrote.</p><p>The fix to be applied by the company will include using a different adhesive that is “not prone to environmental embrittlement” and is reinforced with a stud that is welded to the panel. Cybertrucks still in the factory will be updated and new vehicles will start production on March 21 with the fix already in place, the company said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The recall comes after recent setbacks for Tesla.</p><p>The company’s stock has lost nearly half of its value this year, in large part because of backlash against Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, who is now overseeing cuts to federal spending for the Trump administration. Those cuts have spurred <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tesla-boycott-elon-musk.html" title="">a number of Tesla owners to</a> sell their vehicles in protest of Mr. Musk’s values and politics.
