Two industry groups, the American Health Care Association and LeadingAge, have sued to overturn the regulation, and 20 Republican state attorneys general have <a href="https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/newsroom/attorney-general-bird-sues-to-stop-biden-harris-mandate-that-threatens-mass-shutdown-of-nursing-home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed their own challenge</a>.</p><p>Consumer advocates, industry officials and independent researchers agree that the incoming administration is likely to rescind the rule, given the first Trump administration’s “<a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/trump-administration-puts-patients-over-paperwork-reducing-healthcare-administrative-costs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patients over paperwork</a>” campaign to remove “unnecessary, obsolete, or excessively burdensome health regulations on hospitals and other healthcare providers.” Among other things, Mr. Trump aided the industry by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/business/trump-administration-nursing-home-penalties.html" title="">easing fines against homes that had been cited for poor care</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The Trump administration has proven itself really eager to reverse overreaching regulations,” said Linda Couch, the senior vice president for policy and advocacy at LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit elder care providers. “We think it’s got a pretty good chance of being repealed, and hope so.”</p><p>Issued in April, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-minimum-staffing-standards-long-term-care-facilities-and-medicaid-0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the staffing regulation</a> requires nursing homes to have registered nurses on site around the clock — something that the <a href="https://www.ahcancal.org/Advocacy/Documents/24-Hour-RN.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">industry has endorsed</a> — and to maintain minimum numbers of nurses and aides. Four of five homes <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/a-closer-look-at-the-final-nursing-facility-rule-and-which-facilities-might-meet-new-staffing-requirements/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would have to increase staffing</a>. The requirements would be phased in, starting in May 2026.</p><p>Even before the election, many experts and activists had doubts that the rule would be effectively enforced, given the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/health/nursing-home-staffing-patients.html" title="">poor results in states</a> that have imposed their own minimums. In New York, California, Rhode Island and Massachusetts — states with the most robust requirements — many homes remain below the legal staffing levels. Governors have given many homes reprieves, and other homes have found that paying penalties costs less than the increase in payroll for additional staff.</p><p>The federal government estimates the average annual cost over a decade to meet the Biden mandate would be $4.3 billion a year, a 2 percent increase in expenses, though the changes do not include increases in federal Medicare or Medicaid payments.</p><p>“Staffing is everything in terms of nursing-home quality,” said R. Tamara Konetzka, a professor of public health sciences at the University of Chicago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While the rule’s effectiveness was uncertain, she worried that repealing it would send the wrong message. “We would be losing that signal that nursing homes should try really hard to improve their staffing,” she said.</p><p>Advocate groups for nursing home residents, who had criticized <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cms-study-nursing-home-staffing-levels/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Biden administration</a> rule for not requiring even higher staffing levels, have since pivoted and are trying to protect it.</p><p>“We’re hoping the president-elect will come in and take a look at the science and data behind it and see this really is a modest reform,” said Sam Brooks, the director for public policy for The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit. “We’d be devastated to see it fall.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Striking nursing home workers in Westland, Mich., in October 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elconin/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment, but in a court filing it argued that nursing homes should be able to reach the required staffing levels.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There is more than enough time to identify, train and hire additional staff,” the Biden administration wrote.</p><p>The quality of care in the nation’s 15,000 nursing homes and the lack of adequate staffing for their 1.2 million residents has <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1178632920934785" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been a concern</a> for decades. Inspection reports continue to find homes leaving residents lying in their own feces, suffering severe bedsores and falls, contracting infections, choking on food while unattended or ending up back in a hospital for preventable reasons. Some nursing homes overuse psychotropic medications to pacify residents because they do not have enough workers to attend to them.</p><p>Leslie Frane, the executive vice president of the SEIU, the Service Employees International Union that represents healthcare workers, said in a statement that “far too many nursing home owners will not do the right thing and invest in workers without oversight and binding regulation.”</p><p>The nursing home industry says many homes cannot afford to increase their workforces, and that, even if they could, there is a scarcity of trained nurses, and not enough people willing to work as aides for an average $19 an hour. A registered nurse <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics4_623100.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earns $40</a> an hour on average in a nursing home, less than what they could make at a hospital, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The Biden administration noted in its court filing it was planning to spend $75 million to recruit and train more workers, and that there were more than 100,000 workers who left nursing homes during the pandemic and could be lured back if salaries and working conditions were better.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>How many nursing homes could afford the increased cost remains a mystery because of weaknesses in the government’s <a href="https://theconsumervoice.org/uploads/files/issues/2023-Related-Party-Report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">requirements for financial transparency</a>. About <a href="https://www.medpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mar24_Ch6_MedPAC_Report_To_Congress_SEC.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half of homes lose</a> money, according to their reports to Medicare, but some <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nursing-home-owners-drained-cash-during-pandemic-while-residents-deteriorated/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nursing home owners grow</a> rich through <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/care-suffers-as-more-nursing-homes-feed-money-into-corporate-webs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clandestine maneuvers to siphon profits</a> into their own pockets.</p><p>This month, owners of Centers Health Care, one of the New York State’s largest nursing home chains, agreed to <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-secures-45-million-and-delivers-major-reforms-four" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pay $45 million</a> to settle allegations by Attorney General Letita James that they diverted $83 million intended for resident care to themselves during the pandemic.</p><p>Maryellen Mooney, a spokeswoman for the Centers Health Care chain, which denied the allegations, said in a statement that Centers was “committed to fully implementing the settlement terms, including a significant investment in resident care.”</p><p>About three-quarters of nursing homes are for-profit. The industry, though, highlights the most sympathetic examples: rural nonprofit nursing homes like Kimball County Manor &amp; Assisted Living in Kimball, Neb. Its staffing levels for registered nurses are 40 percent below what the new rule would require, federal data shows.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Sarah Stull, Kimball’s administrator, said recruitment had always been challenging and that temporary nursing staffing agencies charged more than double what she paid her own staff.</p><p>“We had to pay $65 for a nurse aide during Covid and that’s insane,” she said.</p><p>The government estimated that about a fourth of the nation’s nursing homes would be eligible to apply for hardship exemptions if there were a documented shortage of nurses and aides in their communities compared with the national average.</p><p>But Nate Schema, the chief executive of the Good Samaritan Society, which runs 133 nonprofit homes mainly in the rural Midwest, estimated that only seven would be likely to qualify for a hardship waiver.</p><p>“Philosophically, they sound great,” he said, “but in practicality and how they’re put together, they won’t do much for us.”</p><p>Jordan Rau is a senior correspondent with KFF Health News, part of KFF, a nonprofit health-policy research, polling and news organization.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
