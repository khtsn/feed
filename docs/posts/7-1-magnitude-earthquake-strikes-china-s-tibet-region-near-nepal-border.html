Shigatse is regarded as a holy site as the seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most senior figures in Tibetan Buddhism.</p><p>A tourist not far from Shigatse who spoke to The Times said she was in her hotel room when the earthquake started shaking her building. She said the electricity went out and that she and a friend squatted between the beds. When the shaking stopped, they ran out of the building.</p><p>The tourist, who only gave her surname, Xu, shared a video showing several single-story brick buildings with collapsed walls. Video posted on Chinese social media showed streets strewed with rubble, cars crushed by fallen bricks, and roads split open by the shifted ground. Ms. Xu said that she grabbed her down jacket before she ran out.</p><p>China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, ordered officials to minimize casualties and resettle survivors. The Chinese authorities deployed 1,500 rescuers and more than 250 vehicles for the search effort, which was taking place in frigid conditions, with temperatures dipping as low as 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius). In photos published by state media, rescuers appeared to be digging through piles of rubble from toppled houses using ropes, shovels and working by hand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Himalayan region is prone to powerful earthquakes. In 2015, a quake in Nepal with a magnitude of 7.8 killed nearly 9,000 people.
