                  <p>&#34;We have been working really hard since the beginning of the year,&#34; <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/8371/alex" data-tooltip-id="uid734723460">Alejandro <span>&#34;⁠alex⁠&#34;</span> Masanet</a> told HLTV. &#34;We practiced online for a week and a half, and then we just traveled to Paris to play.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We played BLAST Bounty and the Rio qualifier from there. I think we have been playing so intensively since the break. I think we’ve had only two days off in the season, so that&#39;s why I think we are performing this well, but also now I can feel the team is a little bit tired. That&#39;s why we are lacking energy.&#34;</p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>A 2-1 victory, and you are through to the playoffs at Roman Imperium. It was a close series, and you had to make a comeback on the second map. Did you expect it to be this hard?</strong></p>
                  <p>No, to be honest, but I think we were lacking energy. I think they played really well, to be honest, and we weren’t on point, I’d say. They were playing aggressively, we didn’t adapt properly, and I think they punished us in many rounds.</p>
                  <p><strong>You’ve had a very good start to the year. You won InstabuLAN, you qualified for IEM Rio as well. What do you think has been the secret to unlocking this kind of form, especially during such an important moment of the season when we&#39;re getting close to the Major cut-off?</strong></p>
                  <p>We have been working really hard since the beginning of the year. We practiced online for a week and a half, and then we just travelled to Paris to play. We played BLAST Bounty and the Rio qualifier from there. I think we have been playing so intensively since the break. I think we’ve had only two days off in the season, so that&#39;s why I think we are performing this well, but also now I can feel the team is a little bit tired. That&#39;s why we are lacking energy.</p>
                  <p><strong>Back at EPL, you said that some good results don&#39;t mean anything if you can&#39;t find consistency. Do you think that the team is better prepared now to find that consistency, to get these results more often?</strong></p>
                  <p>I guess we need to prove it on LAN. Because when we are practicing, when we are playing from Paris or playing from home, I think we are playing well. But then in official games on LAN, I think we are lacking sometimes... maybe experience. Maybe there are some nerves. I don&#39;t know how to describe it. But I think this is the way; even if it&#39;s tough, a win is a win. I think that&#39;s our main point, to find that consistency, to play against the best teams, but also to not lose against worse teams.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>According to the latest prediction model, you have a 68% chance of reaching the next Major. What would it mean for the team and for Gentle Mates to get to the Major?</strong></p>
                  <p>It would be amazing to get the spot. It&#39;s also our goal, our main goal. But at the same time, it&#39;s hard... If you have that goal, you’re going to have pressure on your shoulders, but I think we should play with that.</p>
                  <p>We created this team for high competition. It is what it is. I think the goal is making us work even harder. It would be amazing.</p>

                  </a>
                  <p><strong>A good run here obviously will get you very close to the Major. With that in mind, and with the quality of the teams here in mind, what goals have you set for this tournament?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think we haven&#39;t set any goals for this tournament. Of course, I think it&#39;s to reach the semi-finals, maybe, or just to go through the group stage. I don&#39;t remember. I don&#39;t think we even talked about the expectations or goals for this tournament, but I think everyone knows the goal for the tournament, and I think everyone wants to win the tournament, basically.</p>
                  <p><strong>What about goals for the year? You are going to play in Rio, and there’s a very good chance you’ll make it to the Major. How far do you think the team can go this year?</strong></p>
                  <p>First of all, I think we need to know how to deal with pressure, with the Major pressure, also. Once we know if we’re getting the spot or not, I think we&#39;re going to release that pressure, and we&#39;re going to start playing even better. So, that&#39;s why I think this tournament and the next ones will be very important for us. I expect this team to be competitive at least. I think we are capable of it. We have the players, and we&#39;re a really good group of friends and guys who want to work hard and achieve some goals.</p>
