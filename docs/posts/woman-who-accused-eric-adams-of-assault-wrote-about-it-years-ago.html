But it did say that she told seven of the nine people he had assaulted her before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/nyregion/adult-survivors-act.html" title="">the Adult Survivors Act</a> took effect in 2022. That legislation opened a window for people to bring lawsuits over sexual assaults said to have occurred years ago.</p><p>The woman provided two documents showing that she sent emails about the assault in 2021 when Mr. Adams was running for mayor and before she had the ability to sue him under the new state law, according to the filing, which was a letter written to the judge, Richard G. Latin, of the State Supreme Court.</p><p>Mr. Adams has denied the allegations, and his allies have sought to attack the woman’s credibility and her history of filing lawsuits. Her past comments to people about the assault and any written documentation of it could be central to the lawsuit.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The mayor’s legal team has been battling with the woman’s lawyer, Megan Goddard, in court documents ahead of her deposition, which could take place as early as this summer.</p><p>The woman said she worked with Mr. Adams at New York City’s transit police bureau. After she asked him for help with a promotion, Mr. Adams drove her to a vacant lot and requested oral sex, according to <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=pA_PLUS_cpHqgsD0wXkNtBB5ERA==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the 26-page complaint</a>. When she declined, he forced her to touch his penis and ejaculated on her leg, the complaint said.</p><p>The lawsuit is pending against Mr. Adams at a time when he is facing a federal investigation into his campaign fund-raising and running for re-election in a competitive Democratic primary next year. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/eric-adams-fbi-investigation.html" title="">reported last week</a> that Mr. Adams and his 2021 campaign were served with a new round of grand jury subpoenas in the federal investigation in July.</p><p>The mayor’s lawyer in the sexual assault case, Alex Spiro, who has represented Elon Musk and other high profile clients, <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=VofnAjtF6AqeDBq9nmUv_PLUS_A==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a letter to the judge last week</a> arguing that the plaintiff in the sexual assault lawsuit was not providing enough information during the discovery process.</p><p>The plaintiff, Mr. Spiro said, has “continued to exhibit a pattern of delay and obfuscation.”</p><p>Mr. Spiro’s letter revealed for the first time that the plaintiff had provided a list of 50 people who had knowledge about the case; Mr. Spiro asked for more information about what each person knew.</p></div></div><div><div><p>His letter also said that the plaintiff had not provided the date that the assault occurred in 1993 and that she appeared to be trying to “backfill the details of her story,” including asking for Mr. Adams’s shift schedules from that year.</p><p>Ms. Goddard’s letter said it was the mayor’s legal team that was not responding to requests for information, including “basic employment records” about whether Mr. Adams and the plaintiff worked together at the transit police department.</p><p>Ms. Goddard wrote that Mr. Spiro’s letter contained “false, inflammatory, and irrelevant statements” about the plaintiff in a “shameless attempt to influence public opinion by litigating this matter in the press.” She accused the mayor of seeking to discredit her “using every means available to him.”</p><p>The lawsuit seeks $5 million and names the Police Department and the Guardians Association, a fraternal organization of Black police officers, as defendants. Mr. Adams was a leader in the Guardians at the time the assault was said to have occurred.</p><p>The woman, who now lives in Florida, has a history of filing lawsuits. She wrote a 52-page self-published book that includes a petition she filed in the United States Supreme Court in 2013 when she represented herself in a lawsuit against the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Board over workers’ compensation.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Adams has strenuously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/nyregion/eric-adams-lawsuit-sexual-assault.html" title="">denied the allegations</a>, and the mayor’s office has sent statements from his political allies criticizing the lawsuit and the motivation behind it.</p><p>“This did not happen — it did not happen,” Mr. Adams said at a news conference in March. “I don’t recall ever meeting this person during my time in the Police Department.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
