But the government has touted the move as a way of demonstrating support for its citizens.</p><p>“For many families and at the level of the whole country, this is tangible,” Mr. Zelensky said in his <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/dlya-nas-v-ukrayini-vazhlivo-shob-riven-nimeckoyi-pidtrimki-94777" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nightly address on Monday</a>, saying that more than 3.2 million Ukrainians had already applied to receive the grant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Analysts say the program is a calculated effort by Mr. Zelensky to shore up his popularity among a population that is growing tired of the war. That fatigue has been exacerbated by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/world/europe/ukraine-war-draft-dodgers-conscription.html" title="">a mobilization drive</a> this year that exposed divides in society and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/europe/ukraine-draft-scandal-conscription.html" title="">corruption scandals</a> that tarnished the government’s image.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=1441&amp;page=2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent poll</a> by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, a private think tank, found that while trust in Mr. Zelensky remained relatively strong at 59 percent, it had nonetheless fallen from 77 percent a year ago.</p><p>“It’s a populist move,” Anatoliy Oktysiuk, a political expert at another Ukrainian think tank, Democracy House, said of the grants. He noted that Mr. Zelensky was aiming to appeal particularly to pensioners, a 10-million-strong electorate in Ukraine that often struggles to make ends meet.</p><p>To address the country’s postwar future, Mr. Zelensky also established a <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/stratehiia-ta-stymuly-shchodo-povernennia-ukraintsiv-z-zakordonu-holovne-zavdannia-ministerstva-natsionalnoi-iednosti-premier-ministr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ministry of National Unity</a> on Tuesday. One of its main tasks will be to encourage the return of millions of Ukrainians who fled abroad during the fighting, a significant loss for the country’s economy. But whether the ministry will get substantial funding remains unclear, and the government has offered little details of how it would operate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Allocating payments of 1,000 hryvnias during economic hardships has been something of a tradition in Ukraine, with successive governments employing the measure over the past two decades. Mr. Zelensky himself introduced a similar program in 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic, offering the sum to every citizen who got vaccinated.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Outside a pharmacy in Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, in November.

They can also donate the money to the Ukrainian Army. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee on finance, tax and customs policy, <a href="https://t.me/yzheleznyak/10725" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the program would cost 15 billion hryvnias, about $350 million, and would be funded by reallocating money originally earmarked for unemployment and demining programs.</p><p>The decision to hand out grants appears, at least in part, intended to soften the blow of the tax rise. That increase, which came into effect on Sunday — the same day the state support program was started — includes raising an income tax dedicated to military expenditures from 1.5 percent to 5 percent.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/zminy-do-podatkovoho-kodeksu-pytannia-vidpovidi#:~:text=What%20resources%20does%20the%20Government,salaries%20to%20Ukrainian%20service%20members." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government said</a> the tax increase would raise an additional $3.5 billion this year and next year, and that the money would primarily be used to pay the salaries of Ukrainian service members.</p><p>But the simultaneous tax increase and grants have sent a contradictory message, critics say. “With one hand they’re taking the money, and with the other they’re giving it back,” Mr. Zhelezniak, a member of the opposition Holos party, said in a phone interview. “It makes no sense.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Economists have criticized the grant program as an inefficient economic tool, arguing that the small individual payments would have little impact on stimulating the economy and that the total sum would be better allocated to the army.</p><p><a href="https://t.me/thinktankces/2630" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yuriy Gaidai</a>, a senior economist at the Center for Economic Strategy, a Kyiv-based research group, said that for the program to have a meaningful social impact, it should have targeted Ukrainians who are struggling financially, such as war-displaced people, pensioners and veterans. A <a href="https://petition.president.gov.ua/petition/237068" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">petition</a> echoing similar grievances has garnered over 25,000 signatures, passing the legal threshold that requires a response from the Ukrainian president.</p><p>Mr. Oktysiuk, the analyst, said that Mr. Zelensky must already be thinking of his fate in postwar elections and might be concerned that he could lose because “people want fresh faces.” Mr. Oktysiuk and other political commentators have pointed to Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, former top commander of the Ukrainian Army <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/europe/zelensky-general-valery-zaluzhny-ukraine-military.html" title="">whom Mr. Zelensky dismissed in February</a>, as a strong potential challenger.</p><p>Daria Mitiuk<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/valery-zaluzhny">Valery Zaluzhny</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Investigation Into Forced Adoptions:</strong> President Vladimir Putin of Russia and senior Kremlin officials “intentionally and directly” authorized <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/europe/russia-ukraine-children-deportation-adoption.html">a program of coerced fostering and adoption of Ukrainian children</a> during the war, according to a Yale University report.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russia Forges Ahead:</strong> Russian troops in eastern Ukraine have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/europe/russia-advances-eastern-ukraine.html">seized at least 10 villages and settlements</a> in recent days, as Moscow presses on with slow but steady advances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Policing in Wartime Ukraine: </strong>For Volodymyr Nikulin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/europe/ukraine-donbas-wartime-policing.html">being a cop in Ukraine</a> means aiding evacuees and tackling looters.
