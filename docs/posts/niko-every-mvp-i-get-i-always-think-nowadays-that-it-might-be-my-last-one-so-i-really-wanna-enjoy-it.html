                  <p>In Malta, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3741/niko" data-tooltip-id="uid408256494">Nikola <span>&#34;⁠NiKo⁠&#34;</span> Kovač</a> came away with the MVP medal, his first since his last trip to Cluj-Napoca nearly a year ago, briefly tying <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/11893/zywoo" data-tooltip-id="uid1260244428">Mathieu <span>&#34;⁠ZywOo⁠&#34;</span> Herbaut</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7998/s1mple" data-tooltip-id="uid1188654299">Oleksandr <span>&#34;⁠s1mple⁠&#34;</span> Kostyliev</a> for most calendar years with MVPs (7).</p>
                  <p>When asked about the feat, which came at a time when the Bosnian&#39;s inevitable future switch to an in-game leader and individual sacrifices he had made to help integrate <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/24177/kyousuke" data-tooltip-id="uid1024395647">Maxim <span>&#34;⁠kyousuke⁠&#34;</span> Lukin</a> is a frequent talking point, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3741/niko" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid408256494">NiKo</a> admitted it meant a lot.</p>
                  <p>&#34;Every event that I play or every MVP I get, I always think nowadays that it might be my last one, so I really wanna enjoy it,&#34; he said in an interview while at PGL Cluj-Napoca. &#34;It&#39;s way harder to get it in this team, especially having Maxim and Ilya, who are the bigger stars and have the bigger space.&#34;</p>

                  <p>&#34;I know I cannot put myself on the same list as ZywOo and s1mple, they are one of a kind, but it obviously brought me joy that I could still play a very high level of CS and get this MVP. It means a lot for my confidence.&#34;</p>
                  <p>In Krakow, the team went out in what&#39;s now often touted as typical <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/11283/falcons" data-tooltip-id="uid402014782">Falcons</a> fashion, unable to rise to the pressure in a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/4494/mouz" data-tooltip-id="uid1845413120">MOUZ</a> elimination match, losing both maps in overtimes as they gave up several advantageous rounds.</p>

                  <p>When asked about these stumbles and whether they are getting in the team&#39;s heads, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3741/niko" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid408256494">NiKo</a> agreed that advantageous situations are a focal point that they are still in the process of learning how to deal with.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We obviously have to focus on these issues because we have lost some of the rounds in very important events, and we felt like those rounds were separating us from lifting trophies a couple of times,&#34; he said.</p>
                  <p>&#34;When it comes to the MOUZ game, I know we lost some of these advantage situations, but these situations came in execution, and the trades are happening, it&#39;s very chaotic,&#34; he went on. &#34;It wasn&#39;t like, for example, the round against Aurora. That round we played very badly, and we could have done much better.&#34;</p>
                  <p>&#34;We have a lot of aggressive players on the team, so we all wanna sometimes take a duel, and then when you wanna play too passive, you don&#39;t take the proper fight because of that.&#34;</p>
                  <p>You can listen to or read the interview, in which <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3741/niko" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid408256494">NiKo</a> also told us about their strong start in Cluj-Napoca against <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/4914/3dmax" data-tooltip-id="uid321207274">3DMAX</a> and why he doesn&#39;t believe the Anubis changes are enough to change the meta significantly, below:</p>
                  
                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>You&#39;ve returned to Cluj, a year after you claimed an MVP here. You started out well here against 3DMAX — tell me about the match. It felt pretty convincing from the outside.</strong></p>
                  <p>I think it was a good match for us overall, especially because we had some shaky starts in the past, especially in Krakow, so it feels good to start with... I wouldn&#39;t say a convincing win, because I still think it was a very hard match, especially on Nuke. We started a bit slower, I think we just needed some time to get into the game a little bit.</p>
                  <p>We also got a little bit surprised by their pick. Nuke is not a map they usually pick. We knew it was a possibility, but we didn&#39;t prepare it too much. Just a slow start a little bit, we were figuring out how they wanted to approach their T side, and then once we figured it out, we found a pretty good solution and everyone was on point today. Our communication was very good ever since that slow start from Nuke. It felt good.</p>
                  <p>Dust, we have some troubles on T side, which happened in past matches as well, so it&#39;s something we have to look at again, even though we did in this period between Krakow and Cluj. We tried to improve our T side on Dust2 because it was shaky in Krakow. Still, not the worst T side, we grinded some rounds, but we could have won some more if we connected one or two rounds that were money-changers for them. But overall, a good match for us.</p>

                    <p>Falcons beat 3DMAX in their opening match in Cluj-Napoca</p>
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>You were talking about communication, and that was something you also mentioned in the interview with Banks prior the tournament as something that you wanted to improve on after Krakow. Does it feel like you were heading in the right direction in this match, or do you think that&#39;s only going to come to light in pressure moments?</strong></p>
                  <p>I definitely saw us do better here already than what we did against Aurora, for example, in Krakow. There&#39;s definitely improvements already, but I think you&#39;re right, I think the challenges will be harder later on, maybe in the playoffs, grand finals, semi-finals, or the qualification games. It&#39;s definitely gonna be a bit harder, but this is something we really wanna try to focus on and improve because I think it&#39;s one of the reasons that separates us from being a constant top team.</p>
                  <p><strong>Back in Malta, you got the MVP, and for a moment you tied the record with ZywOo and s1mple for most calendar years with MVPs. Does it feel vindicating, in a way, to get a testament to your longevity at a time when there&#39;s a lot of talk about your career trajectory and the sacrifices you&#39;ve made to bring in kyousuke?</strong></p>
                  <p>Honestly, I never really... Every event that I play or every MVP I get, I always think nowadays that it might be my last one, so I really wanna enjoy it. It&#39;s way harder to get it in this team, especially having Maxim and Ilya, who are the bigger stars on the team and have the bigger space.</p>
                  <p>I didn&#39;t know about the record, and I know I cannot put myself on the same list as ZywOo and s1mple, they are one of a kind, but it obviously brought me joy that I could still play a very high level of CS and get this MVP. I think it means a lot for my confidence, and I really enjoyed it. I was really surprised when I learned that I got the MVP, because I didn&#39;t expect it, at all. It didn&#39;t cross my mind in a single moment. It felt nice.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>It just doesn&#39;t feel like Anubis changed much, even though the changes are supposed to be big</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>You&#39;ve had a chance to play a bit of Anubis. What are your thoughts on how the changes have impacted the way the map plays?</strong></p>
                  <p>Honestly, I think it&#39;s rough for us to say anything because in Malta we played on the old Anubis and in Krakow we only had two matches, and even in the practices we had it wasn&#39;t a lot of practice on this map. We did what we could, but if you combine the whole season so far, we maybe had four to five days of practice on this map overall. It&#39;s not a lot. We definitely need more resources and more time to see how the map will play out.</p>
                  <p>Especially for us, we don&#39;t know how good or bad we are on the map yet, but for the map itself, it just doesn&#39;t feel like it changed much, even though the changes are supposed to be big. Early round it changed a lot, but when it comes to mid to late-round, I feel like it&#39;s played the same way. I think we need a bigger update on this map if we wanna change the meta, in a way.</p>
                  <p><strong>I wanted to ask you about the MOUZ elimination game in Krakow. The talking point that is always around Falcons is some of these advantages and the situations that you end up losing. I was listening to the Talking Counter podcast, where dupreeh said he spoke to zonic, who said that maybe even in one of these situations, you were playing it too correctly, as if you&#39;re going too far in the other direction of what you&#39;re trying to address. Janko replied in a way that sometimes it&#39;s a bad thing to over-address these situations, talk about them too much, because they become too much of a thing and you overthink them in the moment. Do you feel like that&#39;s happening, where you&#39;re too focused on these situations, and it&#39;s getting in your heads?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think they definitely have a point with this. We obviously have to focus on these issues because we have lost some of the rounds in very important events, and we felt like those rounds were separating us from lifting trophies a couple of times, so we had to put emphasis on these rounds.</p>
                  <p>I think when it comes to the MOUZ game, I know that we lost some of these advantage situations, but also these situations came in execution. They would do an execute, we would kill the first two or three guys, and then the trades are happening, it&#39;s very chaotic. It wasn&#39;t like, for example, the round against Aurora. That round we played very badly, and we could have done much better.</p>
                  <p>It&#39;s one of the things that we are in process of learning how to play these rounds, in a way that we have a lot of aggressive players on the team, so we all wanna sometimes take a duel instead of playing for information or a shoulder peek, and then when you wanna too play passive, you don&#39;t take the proper fight because of that. It&#39;s definitely a focus point for us, but we also know that we don&#39;t wanna play too passive. We don&#39;t wanna give opponents too much space and, if we&#39;re 5v2, we just all hide and they creep up on us and kill us.</p>
                  <p>We know that can be an issue as well, but I don&#39;t think that was an issue against MOUZ. Maybe against Aurora that one round, but against MOUZ, in my opinion, it was just the trades happening. Yes, in hindsight, we could have definitely played better, maybe someone could have gotten a kill or many different scenarios could have happened, but... obviously, it&#39;s a focus point for us.</p>
