Primal and incandescent battles against the Hall of Fame middleweights <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/sports/emile-griffith-boxer-who-unleashed-a-fatal-barrage-dies-at-75.html" title="">Emile Griffith</a> of the Virgin Islands and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/obituaries/carlos-monzon-boxer-dies-at-52.html" title="">Carlos Monzon</a> of Argentina turned into poignant friendships when his former antagonists became troubled. (Benvenuti himself was <a href="http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/modern/benvenuti.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inducted</a> into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992).</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Benvenuti was 119-1 as an amateur and winner of an Olympic gold medal. After turning professional in 1961, he built a record of 82-7-1 with 35 knockouts, and won the world light middleweight championship and the world middleweight championship twice. He retired in 1971 after losing for a second time to Monzon, when his corner threw in a white towel of surrender.</p><p>It was Benvenuti’s Olympic victory in his home country that carried the most meaning, he told <a href="https://ringmagazine.com/en/news/best-i-faced-nino-benvenuti" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Ring magazine</a> in 2016. Why? “Because it lasts forever,” he said. “I’m now a former middleweight champion of the world yet I’m still an Olympic gold medalist.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Benvenuti in 1960 when he won a gold medal at the Rome Olympics.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Picture Art Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He only realized the significance of being named the top boxer at the Rome Games years later, he once said, “when Muhammad Ali really became Muhammad Ali and the best boxer in the world.”</p><p>Giovanni Benvenuti was born on April 26, 1938, on the Adriatic coast in what was then Isola d’Istria, Italy (now Izola, Slovenia). He started boxing at age 11. Two years later, <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/boxing/hall-of-fame-boxer-nino-benvenuti-passes-away-aged-87" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Sports Illustrated</a>, he began riding his bicycle roughly 13 miles to Trieste, Italy, to participate in amateur bouts and, later, some professional fights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>After retiring, Benvenuti appeared in a couple of movies, playing a farmer in one and a tough-fisted gangster in another; opened a restaurant; became a television commentator and, briefly, a city councilman in Trieste. The 45 rounds he spent in the ring with Griffith over three bouts in New York in 1967 and ’68 led to an unassailable bond between the men.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Giuliano Gemma, left, and Benvenuti in a scene from the 1969 movie “Vivos o Preferiblemente Muertos” (“Sundance and the Kid”), in which Benvenuti played a gangster.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gianni Ferrari/Cover, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Benvenuti asked Griffith in 1980 to be the godfather of one of his sons. And, as recounted in <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2009/12/26/former-boxing-champs-nino-benvenuti-emile-griffith-show-nobility-reigns-in-fight-game/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily News</a> of New York, he gave Griffith $10,000 in 2009 as his rival turned friend, who by then had dementia, was struggling financially. (Griffith <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/sports/emile-griffith-boxer-who-unleashed-a-fatal-barrage-dies-at-75.html" title="">died</a> in 2013.)</p><p>He supported Monzon when he went on trial in 1988; the Argentine was convicted of killing his wife (some reports said it was his estranged girlfriend). When Monzon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/obituaries/carlos-monzon-boxer-dies-at-52.html" title="">died in 1995</a>, Benvenuti served as a pallbearer at his funeral.</p><p>Information about Benvenuti’s survivors was not immediately available. He had reportedly been married twice; his second wife, Nadia Bertorello, died in 2023. He once lamented to Il Messaggero, a leading Italian newspaper, that with “a more serene love life,” he could have remained champion “for a hundred years.”</p><p>Asked by The Ring magazine in 2016 about the best overall fighter he faced, Benvenuti named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/13/obituaries/sugar-ray-robinson-boxing-s-best-is-dead.html" title="">Sugar Ray Robinson</a>, whom he beat on points. But, alas, the two never actually met — he had only faced him in a very vivid dream.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeré Longman is a Times reporter on the Obituaries desk who writes the occasional sports-related story.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
