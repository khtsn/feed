</div></section></div><div><div><p>Welcome to Opinion’s commentary for Night 2 of the Democratic National Convention. In this special feature, Times Opinion writers rate the evening on a scale of 0 to 10: 0 means the night was a disaster for Kamala Harris; 10 means it could lead to a big polling bump. Here’s what our columnists and contributors thought of the event, which included speeches by Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, Doug Emhoff and Michelle and Barack Obama.</p><h2 id="link-1e36b0fa">Best Moment</h2><p><strong>Kristen Soltis Anderson, contributing Opinion writer </strong>Doug Emhoff’s description of Kamala Harris as a “joyful warrior” could be a formidable theme for the next few months.</p><p><strong>Binyamin Appelbaum, member of the editorial board </strong>The rocking state roll call, featuring the rapper <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1826051971247194112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lil Jon</a> as Georgia’s hype man.</p><p><strong>Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious </strong>Democrats played a short video that offered voters a clear choice between Harris’s plan to lower drug costs, build three million new homes and give over 100 million Americans a tax cut; and what she described as Donald Trump’s plan to repeal Obamacare and impose a national sales tax (!) so he can cut taxes for billionaires. Expect to see this in ads soon.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Charles M. Blow, Times columnist </strong>Michelle Obama taking direct swipes at Trump. She still hasn’t gotten over — and may never get over — the way Trump harassed her family. It is a grudge worth holding.</p><p><strong>Michelle Cottle, political writer for Opinion </strong>Barack <em>and</em> Michelle. Their speeches were very different — she had way more edge than he did — but I refuse to choose between them, and you can’t make me.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Liam Donovan, Republican strategist </strong>In a parade of speakers peddling predictable anti-Trump talking points, Emhoff gave us the first speech making the pitch for Kamala Harris, the person. Disarming, self-deprecating, humanizing, it was the most effective speech yet for normies at home.</p><p><strong>Michelle Goldberg, Times columnist</strong> Michelle Obama’s speech was therapy for traumatized Democrats still mourning the “dimming” of hope under Trump and struggling to manage their anxiety over his possible return.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Matt Labash, author of the newsletter Slack Tide </strong>Emhoff was a genuine surprise: warm, funny, natural, human, clearly smitten with his spouse. Just like Melania!</p><h2 id="link-551afe84">Worst Moment</h2><p><strong>Anderson </strong>The hour after California cast its delegates to the sounds of Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” dragged on like the air slowly being let out of a balloon. Anyone who tuned in because they heard this convention was must-watch TV probably felt let down.</p><p><strong>Appelbaum </strong>JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, became the latest Democrat to try his hand at trumping Trump, declaring, “Take it from an actual billionaire: Trump is rich in only one thing. Stupidity!”</p><p><strong>Barro </strong>Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers struggling to remember Harris’s name. What was that?</p><p><strong>Blow </strong>The program lagged a bit with the early speakers.</p><p><strong>Cottle </strong>Crabby Uncle Bernie Sanders and his laundry list of policy must-dos. I know. I know. He has a following. But his shouty-grumpy-old-man thing felt out of sync with the week’s vibes. Maybe if he’d worn the mittens. …</p></div></div><div><p><strong>Donovan</strong> Few things were more surreal than seeing Pritzker, a hotel heir, wield his net worth as a cudgel against Trump minutes after Sanders gave him the stage.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Goldberg </strong>I’m a Pritzker fan but his flex about being an “actual billionaire” was an off-key note at a convention focused on middle-class economics.</p><p><strong>Labash </strong>It’s fun to see people having fun in politics again, and Democrats are obviously exuberant. But watching Chuck Schumer getting jiggy with it as he danced his way out to the lectern was a bridge too far. A bridge I want to burn, after bathing my eyes in hydrochloric acid.</p><h2 id="link-1fcce74e">What Else Caught Your Eye?</h2><p><strong>Anderson </strong>Lil Jon’s appearance during Georgia’s delegate count must’ve made the rounds in many an “elder millennial” group chat. If you’re going to use the power of celebrity at your convention, this was light-years better than anything preachy.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Appelbaum </strong>Sanders, always and forever the guy at the party who is determined to have a serious conversation, made clear on Tuesday night what he expects from a Harris presidency — and offered a necessary reminder to Democrats that politics is ultimately about policy.</p><p><strong>Barro</strong> I doubt the high-energy, D.J.-led roll call was electorally useful, but it was fun to watch, especially when Lil Jon showed up to help cast Georgia’s votes.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Blow </strong>Barack Obama was clearly trying to walk the line between elder statesman and queen maker, between being reverential to the ousted Joe Biden and cementing Harris as Biden’s rightful replacement and the natural heir to the Obama legacy.</p><p><strong>Cottle </strong>The Emhoff segment was flat-out adorable — from the video intro, voiced by his son and featuring <em>so</em> many stylish pics of the second gentleman in his youth, to Emhoff’s hilarious retelling of how he and Harris met. And Emhoff’s shout-out to his “motha”? Chef’s kiss.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Donovan </strong>The roll call was evidence both of the party’s unmistakable enthusiasm for this ticket and of the palpable relief everyone in the convention hall is feeling this week. Surprisingly fun to watch, if only for the walk-up music.</p><p><strong>Goldberg </strong>Republicans keep trying to weaponize bad-faith accusations of antisemitism against Democrats, but between Schumer, Sanders, Pritzker and uber-mensch Emhoff, Tuesday showed which party really welcomes Jews.</p><p><strong>Labash </strong>If, as many people fear, Trump is re-elected and tries to throw over the 22nd Amendment, which forbids presidents from running for a third term, then Barack Obama might want to enter the ring again. Love him or hate him, the man still has a wicked left hook.</p></div></div><div></div><div><div><p>Charles M.
