It is the first known case in the United States.</p><p>The individual, who was not identified, had recently returned from East Africa. The patient was diagnosed in San Mateo County, just south of San Francisco, and was isolating at home.</p><p>Officials at the California Department of Public Health and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are reaching out to potential contacts of the patient for further testing.</p><p>There is no evidence that this version of the mpox virus, called Clade Ib, is circulating in communities in the United States, C.D.C. officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Infections in people returning from Africa, however, have been found in Germany, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom, among other countries. A case in India was reported in a person returning from the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>In Germany, Sweden, Thailand and India, the virus was transmitted no farther. In the United Kingdom, the infected individual passed mpox to three household contacts.</p><p>“The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anticipated overall risk of Clade I mpox</a> to the general population in the United States from the outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa is low,” the C.D.C. said in a statement on Saturday.</p><p>There are two main types of mpox, formerly monkeypox: Clade I and Clade II. A subtype of Clade II caused a global epidemic in 2022, mostly among gay and bisexual men, affecting <a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 100,000 people</a> in 116 countries. About 200 people died.</p><p>That virus continues to circulate in the United States, but now at lower levels.</p><p>More recently the Clade Ib subtype has caused enormous misery in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as in Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There have been more than 57,000 confirmed or suspected cases since January and nearly 1,200 deaths, many of them children. The World Health Organization declared the epidemic a global emergency in August.</p><p>Until recently, Clade Ib spread mainly through consumption of contaminated meat or close contact with infected animals and people. But last year the virus was discovered to be spreading sexually, often through heterosexual prostitution.</p><p>Mpox is transmitted through close personal contact. The incubation period is three to 17 days, and the illness usually manifests as a painful rash on the hands, feet, chest, face, anus or genitals.</p><p>The C.D.C. recommends that all people at risk, including sexually active gay and bisexual men, receive two doses of the Jynneos vaccine.</p><p>Apoorva Mandavilli<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Discover More in Health and Science</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Pandemic and Drinking</strong>: Americans started drinking more as the Covid-19 pandemic got underway, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/health/alcohol-misuse-pandemic.html">excessive drinking persisted in the years after Covid arrived</a>, according to new data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Joy in a Terror Bird: </strong>In Colombia, a fossil-collecting rancher has found a giant, flightless killer from 13 million years ago — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/science/fossils-colombia-terror-birds.html">a missing link to the region’s evolutionary history</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Satellite Made of Wood</strong>: A SpaceX rocket launched carrying the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/science/japan-wooden-satellite.html">first satellite model with wooden components</a>, an outcome of an endeavor by scientists in Japan.
