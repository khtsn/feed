The following day in Riyadh, there were friendly talks between Russia and the United States.</p><p>And on Friday, the kingdom is expected to host Arab officials to plan for the reconstruction of Gaza.</p><p>That Saudi Arabia is the setting for talks with such monumental stakes stands as further evidence that the crown prince — known by his initials M.B.S. — is well on his way to achieving his goal of becoming a global power player.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The meetings represent a remarkable turnabout for Prince Mohammed, the oil-rich Gulf kingdom’s de facto leader who was shunned for a time in diplomatic circles. He was accused of severe human rights abuses that he has denied, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html" title="">approving the killing</a> in 2018 of the Washington Post journalist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/europe/turkey-saudi-khashoggi-dismember.html" title="">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, a Saudi dissident.</p><p>Here is what to know about the crown prince’s past actions and his plans for Saudi Arabia.</p><h2 id="link-d9ef1bb">A new vision for the kingdom</h2><p>In 2016, about a year after his father, King Salman, ascended the throne, Prince Mohammed, then a deputy crown prince, introduced Vision 2030. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/middleeast/saudi-arabias-grand-plan-to-move-beyond-oil-big-goals-bigger-hurdles.html" title="">bold plan</a> aimed to diversify the kingdom’s economy and make it less reliant on oil. It included increasing the number of Saudis in private employment, including women; soliciting foreign investment; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/business/energy-environment/saudi-aramco-ipo.html#:~:text=Saudi%20Aramco%20is%20now%20the,that%20Prince%20Mohammed%20originally%20imagined." title="">selling shares of Saudi Aramco</a>, the state oil monopoly, to raise capital to invest in other sectors, like tourism.</p><p>That blueprint helped M.B.S. clinch his role as crown prince and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/middleeast/mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-arabia.html" title="">heir apparent to the throne</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Part of the prince’s plan for the kingdom was diversifying its economy and selling shares of Saudi Aramco, the state oil monopoly.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fayez Nureldine/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For his economic plan to succeed, the prince also needed to introduce major top-down changes that loosened conservative social strictures.</p><p>The prince pledged to reverse a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/world/middleeast/saudi-driving-ban-anniversary.html" title="">much-vilified ban on women driving</a>. He also kicked off a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/middleeast/mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-arabia.html" title="">lavish financial conference</a> to sell investors on Saudi Arabia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As part of that pitch, the prince spoke of a “moderate, balanced Islam that is open to the world and to all religions and all traditions and peoples.”</p><h2 id="link-2ce22c89">Roundup of rivals</h2><p>That initial 2017 investment conference was at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, a venue to which some attendees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/middleeast/ritz-carlton-riyadh-saudi-princes.html" title="">soon returned</a> under very different circumstances.</p><p>Hundreds of Saudi Arabia’s wealthiest and most powerful men, including a number of M.B.S.’s royal relatives, were rounded up and held at the hotel.</p><p>The government said it was cracking down on corruption. M.B.S. was named to head the committee leading the investigations. Critics said he had orchestrated the detentions to consolidate his power. To secure their release, many detainees surrendered huge sums of money and gave the government control of their companies.</p><p>The crown prince called it “ludicrous” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/opinion/saudi-prince-mbs-arab-spring.html" title="">at the time</a> to suggest the campaign was a power grab, saying it was essential to rooting out corruption and bolstering foreign investors’ trust.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-f7654d1">Foreign fights</h2><p>It is not only within the kingdom’s borders that the prince has used coercion and force.</p><p>His attempts to minimize Iran’s regional influence by confronting its armed proxy groups, including the Houthi militia in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have at times backfired.</p><p>In 2015, when the prince was defense minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/world/middleeast/al-anad-air-base-houthis-yemen.html" title="">Saudi Arabia led a coalition</a> in a war against Houthi forces in Yemen.

The move was designed to turn the Lebanese against Hezbollah and Iranian meddling.</p><p>Mr. Hariri, a Saudi ally and Hezbollah opponent, was summoned to the kingdom, where, after intense pressure and rough treatment, he resigned as instructed, reading a speech on Saudi TV. Mr. Hariri was allowed to returned home weeks later to retake his office. Rather than tamping down Hezbollah’s influence, the militant group’s power only grew in the wake of what became an international scandal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-74ab881d">A high-profile killing</h2><p>American intelligence sources have concluded that Prince Mohammed approved the assassination in 2018 of Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist, at the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul. M.B.S. was reviled in much of the world over the killing, but President Trump remained his close ally during his first administration.</p><p>Campaigning in 2020, Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over the killing. In 2021, his administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/26/us/report-jamal-khashoggi-killing.html" title="">released a report</a> concluding that elite operatives executed the killing at M.B.S.’s behest. The Saudi government blasted the report and said it had “clearly denounced this heinous crime.”</p><p>For a time, Mr. Biden shunned the crown prince.</p><p>But in 2022, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine affecting oil prices and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/us/politics/iran-nuclear-program-tehran.html?searchResultPosition=22" title="">Iran believed to be expanding its nuclear capabilities</a>, Mr. Biden smoothed over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/world/middleeast/biden-saudi-arabia-mbs.html" title="">relations</a>. The two met in Riyadh, and the meeting gave M.B.S. a measure of the international rehabilitation he sought.</p><h2 id="link-4fee2cea">Alliance of deal makers</h2><p>Mr. Trump in 2018 praised the crown prince as a “truly spectacular ally,” even after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/cia-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html" title="">the C.I.A. concluded</a> that the royal had ordered Mr. Khashoggi’s assassination.

Getting Saudi Arabia to sign on would be a major achievement.</p><p>But Mr. Trump this month antagonized Arab nations by proposing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-gaza-netanyahu-takeover.html" title="">the Gaza Strip could be taken over by the United States</a> to build a “Riviera,” while Palestinians would be displaced to live in Egypt, Jordan and other nations. Saudi Arabia immediately dismissed the notion and said it still insists that a Palestinian state be established before it normalizes relations with Israel.</p><p>In Riyadh on Friday, representatives of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will work on a plan for Gaza’s reconstruction, partly funded by Arab countries, that preserves the possibility of a Palestinian state.</p><h2 id="link-2423d763">Global mediator</h2><p>Saudi Arabia has increasingly played the role of mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war, maintaining that it does not seek to take sides.
