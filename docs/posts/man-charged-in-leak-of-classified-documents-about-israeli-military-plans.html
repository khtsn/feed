    <h1>Man Charged in Leak of Classified Documents About Israeli Military Plans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A C.I.A. official has been charged with disclosing classified documents that appeared to show Israelâ€™s plans to retaliate against Iran for a missile attack earlier this year, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The official, Asif W. Rahman, was indicted last week in federal court in Virginia with two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. He was arrested by the F.B.I. on Tuesday in Cambodia and brought to federal court in Guam to face charges.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/us-intelligence-israel-iran.html" title="">The documents</a> were prepared by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which analyzes images and information collected by U.S. spy satellites. It conducts work in support of clandestine and military operations.</p><p>Mr. Rahman, who worked abroad for the C.I.A., was set to appear in Guam on Thursday.</p><p>The information in the documents is highly classified and details interpretations of satellite imagery that shed light on a possible strike by Israel on Iran. They began circulating last month on the Telegram app. U.S. officials have previously said that they did not know from where the documents had been taken, and that they were looking for the original source of the leak.</p></div></div>
