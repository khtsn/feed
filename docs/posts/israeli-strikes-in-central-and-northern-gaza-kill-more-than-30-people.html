    <h1>Israeli Strikes in Central and Northern Gaza Kill More Than 30 People</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Israeli airstrikes pummeled two areas in central Gaza and a town in the north of the enclave on Sunday morning, killing more than 30 people and wounding several others, according to local rescue and emergency services.</p><p>In central Gaza on Sunday morning, a strike on a home in Nuseirat killed four people, the Palestinian Civil Defense said in a statement. Strikes in nearby Al Bureij killed 13 people, according to Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for the Civil Defense, an emergency rescue group. He said that several others were wounded and that rescuers were still searching for people under the rubble.</p><p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strikes in central Gaza, which came as it is waging <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-north-gaza-hamas-war.html" title="">a renewed offensive</a> in the northern part of the enclave. In an effort to stamp out what the military has called a Hamas resurgence, Israeli troops, tanks and armed drones have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-beit-lahia.html" title="">bombarded northern Gaza almost daily</a>.</p><p>On Sunday, the town of Beit Lahia again came under attack. Mr. Basal said, an Israel strike on a house there killed 15 people. Another strike hit a residential building where dozens of people were sheltering, Mr. Basal said, adding that information on casualties was not immediately available since rescue teams were unable to reach the area.</p></div></div>
