</span> for the Kickoff title. Bilibili is eliminated from the event, earning 1 Championship point but missing out from their first-ever Masters appearance.</p>

<p>The matchup is one EDward Gaming has dominated in the past, having won every single encounter and only losing three maps in eight series. The teams have only played each other twice since the beginning of VCT China, with their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/375262/edg-maintain-flawless-record-over-blg" target="_blank">most recent encounter</a> taking place in the Stage 2 playoffs.</p>

<p>In the map veto, the teams banned their respective permabans, with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/12010/bilibili-gaming/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2025-01-01&amp;date_end=" target="_blank">Bilibili taking away Fracture</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/1120/edward-gaming/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2025-01-01&amp;date_end=" target="_blank">EDG removing Abyss</a>. Bilibili chose Pearl to open the series, while EDG picked their favored map for this event, Haven. Split remained as the fifth and final map, should the series have gone the distance.</p>

<p>Starting off on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430860/bilibili-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-lbf/?game=196729&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>, EDG won the pistol round, but it was Bilibili who took an early lead off the back of multiple <span data-ref-id="3">

<p><em>EDG came back into the map after winning back-to-back rounds.</em></p>

<p>rushia helped recover the second pistol round, setting his team on track to take the lead and force out EDG&#39;s timeout. Bilibili&#39;s strong defense put them up 11-8, but they allowed EDG enough leeway to reach double digits. A solid defense from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> helped his team reach match point, but EDG returned to the less-reinforced B site, forcing overtime after a strong performance from ZmjjKK and <span data-ref-id="7">

</span> held against Bilibili&#39;s B push, and a mid-to-B execute ended the map 14-12 in EDG&#39;s favor.</p>

<p>As with the first map, Bilibili found an early lead on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430860/bilibili-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-lbf/?game=196730&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>, breaking EDG&#39;s 26 round streak. It took a pair of thrifty wins for EDward Gaming to find a way back in the game, eventually tying the scoreline and forcing out BLG&#39;s tactical timeout. Individual showcases from ZmjjKK and Smoggy kept EDG in the lead, sending the map to the break at 7-5. </p>

<p><em>A fast round funnels Bilibili into <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span>&#39;s crosshair.</em></p>

<p>EDG followed up their attacking pistol win with a low buy, and their gamble paid off by 0.12 seconds. They then played an aggressive round to help ZmjjKK net an ace. Bilibili struggled with their economy the remainder of the half, unable to recover even after a consolation round courtesy of a <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/10698/nephh">

</span> 3K. Smoggy all but walked into A to win the final round against BLG&#39;s broken buy, ending the second map 13-6.</p>

<p>Bilibili looked poised to win the pistol round on Lotus, but <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/13768/s1mon">
		S1Mon	</a>
</span> and ZmjjKK finished off a 2v3 to recover. EDG maintained the advantage, with Bilibili eventually finding a point by punishing early pushes and investing a pair of ultimates. For the rest of the half, EDG anticipated their opponent&#39;s gameplans, mainly forcing early A main fights and crunching BLG&#39;s mid execute. </p>

<p><em>After losing a round, EDG counters Bilibili&#39;s plan in order to stay ahead.</em></p>

<p>BLG stayed alive after a pistol win, but EDG&#39;s lead was too large to overcome. Bilibili called a pause after 11-5, which also allowed EDG preparation for their final rounds. In the end, nobody capped off the final round with a 3K, Smoggy assisting him to win a 2v2 and end the map 13-5. </p>

<p>The victory marks EDG&#39;s eighth win against Bilibili, and sets the 2024 Champions up for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430848/trace-esports-vs-edward-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-gf" target="_blank">revenge against Trace Esports</a>, the team that <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/437659/trace-upsets-edg-books-upper-final-slot-at-kickoff" target="_blank">knocked them down</a> to the lower bracket. Bilibili will return to competition until Stage 1, but their Kickoff placement grants them a Championship point, which will aid them in Champions Paris qualification.</p>
