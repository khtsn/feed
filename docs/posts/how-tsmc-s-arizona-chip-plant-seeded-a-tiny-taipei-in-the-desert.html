    <h1>How TSMC’s Arizona Chip Plant Seeded a Tiny Taipei in the Desert</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After Helen Wang finishes work at the new microchip plant looming over the Arizona desert, she drives home to start her side hustle: cooking pots of spicy beef soup and pork noodles for Taiwanese colleagues who are hungry for a taste of home.</p><p>There were almost no Asian groceries or Taiwanese restaurants nearby when the first workers began landing on the northern edge of Phoenix two years ago to work at a chip factory operated by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.</p><p>Since then, the workers and their families have turned a mostly white corner of strip-mall suburbia into a Tiny Taipei.</p><p>Taiwanese businesses are popping up near taquerias and nail salons. Taiwanese cooks have joined Ms. Wang in ferrying meals to the chip factory’s parking lot. Supermarkets have started stocking Taiwanese sauces and noodles. The sound of Mandarin floats through day care centers and schools, where 282 Taiwanese students are enrolled this year.</p></div></div>
