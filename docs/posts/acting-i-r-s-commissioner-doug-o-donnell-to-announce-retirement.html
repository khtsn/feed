    <h1>Acting I.R.S. Commissioner Doug O’Donnell to Announce Retirement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service is expected to announce on Tuesday that he is retiring, according to three people familiar with the move, the latest agency head to depart after Elon Musk’s team pushed for access to sensitive data and mass layoffs.</p><p>Doug O’Donnell, who has spent nearly 40 years at the I.R.S., took over the agency last month after the last commissioner stepped down at the beginning of President Trump’s term. Melanie Krause, the chief operating officer at the I.R.S., is expected to become the new acting leader after Mr. O’Donnell leaves on Friday, the people said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>Mr. O’Donnell’s departure comes at a turbulent time for the I.R.S. Mr. Trump has targeted the tax collector, long a political villain for Republicans, for deep layoffs, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/irs-fires-employees-layoffs-trump.html" title="">more than 6,700 employees dismissed last week</a>. Mr. Musk has suggested the I.R.S. should be abolished and deployed a member of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency to the agency, with others expected to follow.</p><p>With roughly 100,000 staff members before the layoffs, the I.R.S. is responsible for collecting more than $5 trillion in revenue every year. Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had poured billions in new funding into the agency in hopes of modernizing its antiquated technology and beefing up its ability to go after companies and wealthy people who do not pay the taxes they owe.</p></div></div>
