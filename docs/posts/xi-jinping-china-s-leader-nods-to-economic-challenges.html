In recent weeks, China has become more vocal about the need to take measures to bolster its economy.</p><p>The country’s leaders in recent months have pledged to increase <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/business/china-stimulus-economy-debt.html" title="">public borrowing</a>, spend more and cut interest rates to try to lift <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/business/macau-china-xi-jinping.html" title="">consumer spending</a>, a stubbornly weak spot in China’s economy. China’s economy has struggled to rebound after the Covid-19 pandemic, dragged down by widespread problems in its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/business/china-real-estate-restrictions.html" title="">real estate sector</a> and an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/business/china-pinduoduo-ecommerce.html" title="">unrelenting fall in prices</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>China is also facing the prospect of squaring off with President-elect <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/business/trump-komatsu.html" title="">Donald J. Trump</a>, who has threatened to impose tariffs on foreign goods, which could mean even greater levies on U.S. imports from China.</p><p>At a separate New Year’s event earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Xi said the economy grew “about 5 percent” in 2024, meeting the government’s stated target from the start of the year. He said the overall operation of the economy is “stable and steady.”</p><p>Mr. Xi’s confirmation of China’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/business/china-gdp-target.html" title="">5 percent target</a> for gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity, raised questions about the validity of those figures.</p><p>“China’s 2024 claim that G.D.P. growth was on track to meet high targets was impossible to reconcile with increasingly frantic efforts to prop up a flagging economy all year long,” the Rhodium Group, a consulting firm, wrote in a report on Tuesday.</p><p>The increasingly bold measures from the government, such as loosening its monetary policy for the first time in 14 years, does not square, Rhodium argued, with the moderate growth that the 5 percent target would indicate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Rhodium estimates that China’s economy grew between 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent in 2024. It estimated that China can reach between 3 percent to 4.5 percent growth in 2025, and would reach the high end of that range only “if everything falls in Beijing’s favor.” Analysts have said that the Chinese economy is too reliant on exports and policymakers must do more to bolster domestic demand.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Daisuke Wakabayashi is an Asia business correspondent for The Times based in Seoul, covering economic, corporate and geopolitical stories from the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/daisuke-wakabayashi">More about Daisuke Wakabayashi</a></span></p></div><div><p>Claire Fu covers China with a focus on business and social issues in the country.
