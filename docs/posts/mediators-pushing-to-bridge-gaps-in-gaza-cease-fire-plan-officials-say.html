Israeli officials and Hamas leaders have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/20/world/israel-iran-hamas-gaza-war" title="">expressed pessimism</a> over the prospects for an agreement, despite rising public fury in Israel over the failure to bring home the remaining hostages held in Gaza.</p><p>More than 60 living hostages, and the bodies of about 35 other hostages believed to be dead, are still in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities.</p><p>Mass protests erupted in Israel this week after the bodies of six Israeli hostages were found in Gaza; all of them had recently been executed by Hamas, according to Israel. Hamas has issued mixed statements, but at least one heavily implied that the hostages were killed because their captors understood Israeli troops were nearby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For months, mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United States have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">sought to broker an agreement</a> between Hamas and Israel to end the war in Gaza and free the hostages.
