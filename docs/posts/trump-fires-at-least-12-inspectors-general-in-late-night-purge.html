Just two years ago, Congress strengthened that provision by <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11546" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">requiring the notice to include a “substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons” for the removal</a>.</p><p>The move was the latest wave of abrupt upheavals following the inauguration of Mr. Trump that have put the government in increasing confusion.</p><p>There were competing lists circulating in Washington on Saturday morning of which inspectors general had received <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/8039c100ece30695/110cc30e-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an email</a> from the White House telling them that “due to changing priorities, your position as inspector general” was “terminated, effective immediately.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But agencies and departments whose watchdogs were said to have been removed included the departments of agriculture, commerce, defense, education, housing and urban development, interior, labor, transportation and veterans affairs, along with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Small Business Administration.</p><p>It was not clear whether the departments of State and the Treasury were included, but multiple people said that Michael E. Horowitz, the inspector general for the Justice Department, had been spared. Mr. Horowitz was lauded by Mr. Trump’s supporters in 2019 after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/fisa-surveillance-fbi.html" title="">uncovered serious errors and omissions in the F.B.I.’s applications to wiretap a former foreign policy adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign</a> as part of the Russia investigation.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
