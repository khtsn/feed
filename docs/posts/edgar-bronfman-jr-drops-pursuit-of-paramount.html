name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Edgar Bronfman Jr. abandoned his pursuit of Paramount on Monday, dropping his 11th-hour bid roughly a day before the deadline to submit a final offer for the owner of CBS and MTV.</p><p>Mr. Bronfman’s decision to suspend his bid all but ensures that Paramount will be acquired by Skydance, an up-and-coming Hollywood studio that has spent most of this year courting, cajoling and cudgeling Paramount into a deal. Skydance reached an $8 billion merger agreement in July, but that deal included a “go shop” window that allowed Paramount to seek other buyers.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Bronfman said his bidding group had notified a special committee of Paramount’s board of directors Monday that the group would drop its pursuit, adding that it was “a privilege to have the opportunity to participate” in the deal-making process.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bronfman said in a statement that “Paramount’s best days are ahead.” </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Blake/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“While there may have been differences, we believe that everyone involved in the sale process is united in the belief that Paramount’s best days are ahead,” Mr. Bronfman said. “We congratulate the Skydance team and thank the special committee and the Redstone family for their engagement during the go-shop process.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Bronfman said in his statement that Paramount was “an extraordinary company,” calling it “an unrivaled collection of marquee brands, assets and people.”</p><p>Mr. Bronfman’s pursuit appeared to lose stream over the last week as Paramount and its parent company, National Amusements, applied scrutiny to his bid, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. Some people involved in the deal were skeptical that Mr. Bronfman would be able to prove he’d secured financing to justify his $6 billion bid in time, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations.</p><p>Like every development in the sale of Paramount, Mr. Bronfman’s bid was rife with drama. Last week, days before a crucial deadline expired, his group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/business/dealbook/edgar-bronfman-paramount.html" title="">submitted a proposal</a> to take a controlling stake in Paramount for $4.3 billion with a crew of backers that initially included Brock Pierce, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur also known for his role in the “Mighty Ducks” movie franchise.</p><p>Mr. Pierce wasn’t part of the final bidding group, which included institutional investors such as Fortress Investment Group and BC Partners Credit.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But when pressed, Mr. Bronfman did not provide Paramount’s advisers with detailed evidence that his backers had enough capital on hand for a deal. Some of Mr. Bronfman’s backers were skittish about providing detailed financial statements during the due diligence process, and vetting ground to a halt, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Bronfman’s bid was also stymied by the “go shop” process, which forced tight time constraints on the submission and analysis of his bid.</p><p>Days passed, the deadline to submit a fully financed bid loomed, and Paramount’s advisers focused on securing documentation from Mr. Bronfman. Finally, on Monday evening, he informed Paramount’s special committee that he was dropping out of the process.</p><p>The competing bids for Paramount underscored the enduring cultural cachet of the company, which owns a crown jewel film studio, a valuable library of movies and TV shows, and one of three major broadcast networks. Before he dropped his pursuit, Mr. Bronfman said he was prepared to offer $6 billion to acquire a controlling stake in National Amusements and a minority stake in Paramount.</p><p>With its other options exhausted, Paramount will now look to close its deal with Skydance, which has offered $8 billion in capital to buy out Ms. Redstone, pay down debt, improve the company’s balance sheet and buy out existing investors.</p><p>After Mr. Bronfman submitted his initial bid last week, Skydance began working behind the scenes to press its case. The company submitted a letter to Paramount’s special committee demanding that the company stop negotiating with Mr. Bronfman, arguing that Paramount hadn’t fulfilled its obligations under the framework of the existing deal. Paramount continued negotiating with Mr. Bronfman anyway.</p><p>If Paramount closes its deal with Skydance, which is led by David Ellison, it will result in a transition of media ownership from one wealthy family to another. Paramount has been in the hands of the Redstone family for decades, ever since the company was cobbled together by its patriarch, Sumner, through a series of audacious deals. Mr. Ellison is the son of the Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who is backing his son’s bid for Paramount.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Mullin reports on the major companies behind news and entertainment.
