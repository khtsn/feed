</span> with an unexpected brand of double-Duelist aggression. </p>



<p>An EG lower bracket run ran headfirst into 100T after the latter&#39;s loss to NRG last week. 100T emerged as the victor in a close 2-0, breaking the hearts of EG and putting an end to their Kickoff campaign.</p>

<p>EG brought the first map to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596423/100-thieves-vs-evil-geniuses-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-lr3/?game=244854&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>, pitting their standard Neon and Viper against 100T&#39;s Veto version. The Veto worked wonders for 100T on attack, as <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29893/timotino">
		Timotino	</a>
</span>&#39;s Neon paved the way onto the sites for <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4147/cryocells">
		Cryocells	</a>
</span> on Veto and bang on Viper to secure the postplants. Cryo collected 14 kills and 209 ADR in a 10-2 half for 100T.</p>

<p>While the Veto was effective on attack, its weaknesses materialized on defense. The single trip on the three-site map left 100T starved for information, leading to gaps around the map that EG took full advantage of as they pulled the score back to 10-8. Heroics from Timotino and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20140/vora">
		vora	</a>
</span> were what dragged 100T over the line as they dragged the score to 12-9 and finally closed onto 13-11 with a long-awaited B site hold.</p>


<p><em>The Thieves&#39; captain fends off three from EG.</em></p>

<p>The second map of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596423/100-thieves-vs-evil-geniuses-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-lr3/?game=244855&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a> was even closer than the first. Faced with Cryo&#39;s Chamber, EG kept the same Yoru-Waylay composition that they had played in their opening match but swapped the players on those agents, this time putting <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8873/dgzin">
		dgzin	</a>
</span> on Yoru and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8373/okeanos">
		Okeanos	</a>
</span> on Waylay. </p>

<p>That change began to bear fruit particularly in the second half on EG&#39;s defense after a 7-5 first half slightly favored 100T. dgzin was everywhere around the map, deleting the attackers as soon as he saw them with both rifle and Operator as a 17-kill half for the Brazilian Duelist pushed EG to a 12-9 lead.</p>


<p><em>dgzin was a duelling machine on Bind.</em></p>

<p>Faced with the opponent&#39;s map point on their home turf, 100T dug their heels in. Punishing EG&#39;s aggressive pushes got them up to 10, a 4K from Timotino got them to 11, and an attack Operator 3K from Cryo, who remained the safe pair of hands his team needed, forced overtime.  </p>

<p>Overtime was chaotic, but the members of 100T were just a bit better as they won 15-13. dgzin ended the map with 29 kills, eight first kills, and 268 ACS, while Cryo trailed close behind with 27 kills, eight first kills, and 259 ACS.</p>



<p>In the second match of the day, Cloud9 made LEVIATÁN look readable in a one-sided sweep.</p>

<p>Starting with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596424/cloud9-vs-leviat-n-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-lr3/?game=244857&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, Cloud9 demonstrated a clear understanding of LEVIATÁN&#39;s preference for slow attacking defaults. <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/18796/oxy">
		OXY	</a>
</span>&#39;s Operator repeatedly shut down LEVIATÁN&#39;s contact plays as he collected six first kills, while <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/729/zellsis">
		Zellsis	</a>
</span>&#39; Brimstone utility was always waiting for whoever remained when the time was running out as Cloud9 strolled to a 9-3 defensive half. </p>

<p>Sheriffs won LEVIATÁN the pistol round, but any hope of a comeback was immediately dashed as <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17433/v1c">
		v1c	</a>
</span> won Cloud9 the eco round on time with a 4K, spurring the North American squad on to a 13-5 win. v1c was the main fragger with 23 kills to seven deaths and a 1.92 rating.</p>


<p><em>v1c finds four as the time burns away for LEVIATÁN.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596424/cloud9-vs-leviat-n-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-lr3/?game=244858&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Breeze</a> appeared closer at first. Cloud9 selected the map despite being 0-2 on it, adjusting their composition to include a KAY/O rather than a Yoru while LEVIATÁN debuted a Yoru-Jett lineup. After the first map, LEVIATÁN looked more willing to lean into faster rounds, overwhelming the B site multiple times, but C9 still held a 7-5 edge at the half thanks to a pistol and a bonus round.</p>

<p>LEVIATÁN got the second pistol and the follow-up, but those would be their last round wins in the series. Cloud9 played a patient attack, constantly finding gaps for lurks and picking apart the defensive setups for a 13-7 win. OXY topfragged with 20 kills and 15 deaths, while v1c was a thorn in the opponent&#39;s side as the Astra ended with 16 kills and only seven deaths. </p>



<p>The final match of the day pitted the world champions against the regional kings as both were on the hunt for a middle final spot. After G2 had previously shied away from double-Duelist looks, they stunned G2 with a rare form of Pacific-esque aggression, dominating NRG in a 2-0 and sending them down to the lower bracket.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596417/nrg-vs-g2-esports-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-mr4/?game=244834&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a> was a complete shutout. Playing the map for the first time, G2 brought out a composition with <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span> on Phoenix, <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2170/babybay">
		BABYBAY	</a>
</span> on Yoru, and <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> on Veto against NRG&#39;s double-Initiator. </p>

<p>The map started bizarrely as NRG won the eco in round two and then immediately lost the anti-eco afterwards. From there, G2 took the momentum and ran away with it to a 10-2 half. jawgemo farmed early on in the rounds with six first bloods, while <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span> and BABYBAY proved reliable when needed in the retakes as the former went 16/3/4 and the latter when 13/4/4 in the first half alone. </p>

<p>The nail in the coffin was round 14. After NRG won the pistol, jawgemo pulled off an ace with a Classic of all weapons in the eco, crushing NRG&#39;s spirits as G2 steamrolled to a 13-3 win.</p>


<p><em>jawgemo wins a round that should never be won with nothing but a Classic.</em></p>

<p>G2 again surprised compositionally on their map pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596417/nrg-vs-g2-esports-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-mr4/?game=244835&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>, where they swapped off the Breach-Fade that they played previously in favor of a fast-paced Neon-Waylay frontline. Picking up where they left off on Pearl, G2 won the pistol and bonus for a 4-0 start on their defense. </p>

<p>Wind in their sails, G2 started getting almost excessive with their aggression and NRG punished them for it, working their way into the game as they won five out of the next seven rounds. The half ended still favoring G2 7-5 thanks to an ace from jawgemo in round 12 and a strong 15-kill performance from BABYBAY.</p>


<p><em>Another ace goes jawgemo&#39;s way.</em></p>

<p>Heading to the attack side, jawgemo continued to shine. The Neon player armed himself with shotguns and went on a tear, entrying on the sites and letting <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3885/valyn">
		valyn	</a>
</span> clean up the rest as G2 went on to win out 13-8. jawgemo topped the board by kills with a 23/12/5 KDA and a 1.43 rating, while his captain outdid him in the rating department with an 18/9/12 KDA and a 1.54 rating.</p>

<p>G2 continues their undefeated streak over NRG and has now earned two opportunities to qualify for Masters Santiago as they book their tickets to the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596418/g2-esports-vs-tbd-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-mbf" target="_blank">middle final</a>. Down in the lower bracket, NRG awaits the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/596425/100-thieves-vs-cloud9-vct-2026-americas-kickoff-lr4" target="_blank">100 Thieves versus Cloud9</a> in a do-or-die match. </p>
