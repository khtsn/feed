While Hinchcliffe may not be widely known, he is a fixture in comedy circles as a frequent guest on “The Joe Rogan Experience” and as a host of the weekly podcast “Kill Tony.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is what to know about Hinchcliffe and his brand of comedy.</p><h2 id="link-46a8bf89">He is known for a ‘roast’ style of insult comedy.</h2><p>Hinchcliffe is a touring comedian based in Los Angeles who appears regularly at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and hosts an online course on how to “roast,” a comedy style in which a guest of honor is the subject of sharp jokes and off-color comments.</p><p>He has written for eight Comedy Central roasts, <a href="https://tonyhinchcliffe.com/pages/bio" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to his website</a>, and has roasted celebrities like Snoop Dogg. This year, he was among the comedians who roasted Tom Brady in a Netflix special that <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-roast-of-tom-brady-netflix-weekly-most-watched-list/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was viewed 13.8 million times</a> in its first week on the streaming platform.

The weekly show, recorded live from Austin, Texas, is perhaps best known for its “Bucket of Destiny” segment, in which aspiring comedians get 60 seconds to perform before a panel of judges.</p><p>Millions tune in to the podcast each week and it is among the most popular offerings <a href="https://podcastcharts.byspotify.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Spotify</a>.

Hinchcliffe has refused to apologize.</p><p>“I knew that what I had done was not wrong,” he told Variety. He added, “My stance is that comedians should never apologize for a joke, should never stop working if everyone comes after them and should never slow down. In fact, they should utilize anything that happens to them for more material.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3a2960c6">He targeted many at the Trump rally.</h2><p>In his appearance of about 12 minutes, Hinchcliffe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/trump-hinchcliffe-msg.html" title="">directed a number of insults</a> and tasteless comments at a wide range of people, including President Biden and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic former House speaker.</p><p>He also took aim at Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end and Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, calling him the next O.J. Simpson. He mocked Palestinians as rock-throwers and Jews as cheapskates.</p><p>“Censorship is amongst us, people,” Hinchcliffe told the crowd. “It’s a very, very, very big deal and I’m just here to say that you guys are for the right candidate.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
