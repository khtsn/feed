</span>, defeating them on Abyss 13-11.</p>

<p>The Swiss Stage format, which VCT fans may recognize as familiar from Masters Madrid, sees the event&#39;s teams pitted against each other by teams of identical records. The four teams to reach two victories will qualify to the event&#39;s playoffs, while the teams with two losses will be eliminated.</p>

<p>The other half of the field will play their opening matches of the Swiss Stage later on the same day, with the next pairing of matches, the first set of qualification and elimination matches, taking place on Friday.</p>



<p>Team Heretics entered this matchup as the overwhelming favorite, having been one of the EMEA region&#39;s strongest teams in the 2024 season. They carry over much of the same roster into the 2025 season, centered around a young core that saw them reach four grand finals but lift none last season.</p>

<p>However, they appeared to have some rust to shake off early on. Split, a relatively well-balanced map as far as attacking and defending goes, seemed to be defense-sided in this particular clash. After stealing the anti-eco round, the German team got out to a 5-1 lead which bubbled into an 8-4 halftime advantage. </p>

<p>There was an element of experimentation in Team Heretics&#39; approach, though. They have tried several different team compositions on Split over the past season, a map that&#39;s been tough for them in stretches. On Thursday, they opted for a triple-Initiator, no-Sentinel composition that saw in-game leader <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/1144/boo">
		Boo	</a>
</span> on KAY/O and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/29873/benjyfishy">
		benjyfishy	</a>
</span> on Breach.</p>

<p>While Team Heretics grabbed eight of the first nine rounds to open the second half, they started with ground to make up. A late surge by FOKUS seemed to threaten overtime, but a well-executed round with anchors from the right players and good mechanics saw them hold onto victory.</p>

</span> went blow-for-blow with his tier-one opponents, finishing the map with 21 kills </p>

<p>The side switch did see a significant momentum shift, though. After winning the pistol round but dropping the anti-eco, FNATIC dropped seven straight rounds, allowing for their American opponents to tie things up and then take the lead.</p>

<p>Cloud9&#39;s double-Controller, and double-Initiator composition helped them put one foot forward on attack, while Duelist <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/18796/oxy">
		OXY	</a>
</span> heated up when his team needed him most.</p>


<p><em>A momentum-snatching ace for OXY.</em></p>

<p>A timeout after going down for the first time from head coach <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/19729/elmapuddy">
		Elmapuddy	</a>
</span> appeared to inspire his team, as they put on a flawless round to knot things at 11, but Cloud9 would not stumble. They closed out a near-perfect attack half, outscoring Fnatic 10-2 with nine rounds being by way of eliminating all five of their opponents.</p>

<p>Alfajer put on a stellar performance in the losing effort, with nine of his 21 kills being first-bloods.</p>

<p>&#34;Honestly, holy moly,&#34; OXY said after the match. &#34;That is actually crazy, I don&#39;t even know what just happened. 3-10 comeback? Was it 3-9? Jesus.&#34;</p>

<p>Team Heretics and Cloud9 will eagerly await the later results of Thursday&#39;s slate of games. They will be drawn against fellow 1-0 teams that leave the opening round victorious, while FOKUS and FNATIC will wait to see who loses.</p>
