I put out a plan: We are going to declare a fentanyl state of emergency on Day 1 of our administration. We are going to get tough on those that are dealing drugs and we are going to be compassionate, but tough about the conditions of our streets as well. We’re going to get people the help that they need: more mental health and drug treatment beds. We’re going to work with state, federal and city law enforcement to make sure that we close these open-air drug markets. On Day 1, I’m going to put all of my holdings, all of my holdings into a blind trust. I have to talk to the city attorney about salary. I don’t anticipate taking one, but I have to talk to him about that.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07election-sf-mayor-cklm/07election-sf-mayor-cklm-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Daniel Lurie, San Francisco’s mayor-elect and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, expressed his commitment to fighting crime and drugs in the city.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mike Kai Chen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Any mayor seeking to declare an emergency must get approval from the city attorney. Traditionally, such orders are used after sudden, unforeseen events, such as major earthquakes and the Covid-19 pandemic, to bypass bureaucratic rules and quickly spend money or hire staff.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/san-francisco-mayor-election.html" title="">Ms. Breed</a> in 2021 declared an emergency in the Tenderloin and used it to quickly establish a service center for people addicted to drugs. But she ended the effort after facing criticism for allowing individuals to use a patio to smoke fentanyl under supervision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Lurie vowed during his campaign to build 1,500 new shelter beds in his first six months in office, make drug treatment available to anyone who wants it and use ankle monitors to track first-time drug dealers.</p><p>He also said he would allow individuals detained for using drugs in public to choose between treatment or jail.</p><p>Mr. Lurie said on Friday that he would place his assets into a blind trust and forgo taking a $383,000 salary.</p><p>Mr. Lurie was asked repeatedly on Friday about how he would stand up to President-elect Donald J. Trump when it comes to protecting transgender people, gay people and immigrants. He said he would “have their backs” but that his focus would be on running the city.</p><p>Breaking with San Francisco political tradition, Mr. Lurie began his remarks right on time and ended them minutes later, with some guests arriving late, only to find the event was already over. That included Larry Baer, the president of the San Francisco Giants, who caught up with Mr. Lurie to ask him to throw out the first pitch on Opening Day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Lurie darted around Chinatown, greeting merchants over the course of many blocks after focusing much of his campaign outreach on Chinese American voters. Shop owners thrust bouquets and melons at him in congratulations.</p><p>About 40 minutes after the event started, it was over. Mr. Lurie was whisked off in a city-issued black Chevrolet Tahoe S.U.V. for the first time.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Heather Knight is a reporter in San Francisco, leading The Times’s coverage of the Bay Area and Northern California.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/heather-knight">More about Heather Knight</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
