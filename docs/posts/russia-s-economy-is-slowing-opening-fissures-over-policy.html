Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Russia’s slowing growth and rising inflation, economists say, show that the sanctions are having an impact, putting a dent in the stimulating effect that the Kremlin’s enormous wartime spending has had on the economy, they say.</p><p>Civilian companies are particularly feeling the pinch.

The report was interpreted by some as a sign of Ms. Nabiullina’s waning support from Mr. Putin.</p><p>Another attack came from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, a pro-government association of large companies known by its Russian acronym, R.S.P.P.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The <a href="https://rspp.ru/activity/analytics/sostoyanie-rossiyskoy-ekonomiki-i-deyatelnost-kompaniy-rezultaty-monitoringa-rspp-vo-iii-kvarrtale-20/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organization said</a> that 36 percent of its members had reported being unable to collect payments from clients in the third quarter of this year, up 14 percentage points from a year ago.

The Russian government is raising taxes on companies and wealthy individuals and is tapping into its sovereign wealth fund. The government’s low debt burden — about 18 percent of economic output — means it has ample room to keep borrowing from Russian banks.</p><p>The battle over Russian interest rates underlines longer-term economic tensions, said Ms. Prokopenko.</p><p>The Kremlin’s seemingly endless war has persuaded Russian business elites to seek short-term profit in an overheated economy over long-term investment. The growing calls for cheap money now threaten to dismantle a system of economic checks and balances that have kept the Russian economy stable over most of Mr. Putin’s rule, Ms. Prokopenko added.</p><p>“If a warring nation can’t present to its people an idea of a bright future, then it makes sense to stuff yourself while the party lasts,” she said. “You may not have that chance later.”</p><p>Oleg Matsnev<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
