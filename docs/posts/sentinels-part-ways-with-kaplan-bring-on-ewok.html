</span> head coach <span data-ref-id="3">Marthinus		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/8347/ewok">Ewok</a>&#34;
		Jacobus Van Der Walt</span>, who will step foot in North America for the first time in his career.</p>

<p>Ewok, who up until the end of the 2025 season had been with RRQ for about as long as kaplan had been with Sentinels, helped develop the Indonesian org from one of the middling teams in the Pacific region into a force to be reckoned with in the span of a year. In 2025, Ewok led a historic year for RRQ. The team lifted its first-ever VCT trophy at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 1</a> to qualify for its first-ever international event in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. The year ended with the team being the second seed out of the Pacific region at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a>.</p>

<p>Around one month after the end of the season, Ewok <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/572949/rrq-head-coach-ewok-to-take-break-from-coaching-for-2026" target="_blank">announced</a> that he was set to take a break from coaching for the 2026 season, stating that it was not the end of his coaching career, but rather &#34;a break to focus on some other areas of my life.&#34; During his absence from the coaching booth, Ewok was a consistent contributor to the VCT Pacific broadcast desk.</p>

<p>Ewok will be replacing kaplan, who, over the years, has held the head coaching job on one of the most publicized teams in all of VCT. kaplan&#39;s time with Sentinels peaked in 2024, when the organization capped off its return from the dead with a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1923/champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff/playoffs" target="_blank">VCT Americas Kickoff</a> trophy, a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1921/champions-tour-2024-masters-madrid/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Madrid</a> trophy to break a two-year international trophy drought, and a fourth-place finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024/playoffs" target="_blank">Champions Seoul</a>. 2025, however, was filled with disappointment, which Moore pointed to as one of the main reasons for the decision to move on from kaplan.  </p>

<p>&#34;kaplan had a successful tenure over the last two years, including bringing home a Masters trophy from Madrid in 2024. Our performance at Champions 2025 was disappointing, and the roster decisions kaplan has made to address these issues have sent us in the wrong direction,&#34; Moore said. &#34;What we saw at Kickoff wasn&#39;t just a results issue; the team wasn&#39;t developing the chemistry we needed. Rather than let that continue, we&#39;re making changes now to give ourselves the best chance to qualify for Champions 2026.&#34;</p>

<p>After a 9th-10th finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2682/vct-2026-americas-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Americas Kickoff</a> to start the year, will miss its first international event since Masters Shanghai, and will now have just over a month for new head coach Ewok to instill his approach.</p>
