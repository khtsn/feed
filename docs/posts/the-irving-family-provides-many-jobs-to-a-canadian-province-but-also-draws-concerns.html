Letters painted in dark blue spell “Irving,” the family whose businesses dominate not only Saint John, but most of New Brunswick.</p><p>The larger of the Irvings’ two local paper mills looms above the Saint John River like a medieval fortress. Irving-owned railway tracks crisscross the city, linking smaller factories owned by the family to ports under Irving control. Irving-owned building-supply stores and gas stations dot the streets in this city of 78,000 people, where park signs honor Irving contributions to their upkeep.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/world/00CloudFactory-01/00CloudFactory-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/world/00CloudFactory-01/00CloudFactory-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/world/00CloudFactory-01/00CloudFactory-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Gravestones sit on a patch of grass with the tanks of an oil refinery in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/world/00CloudFactory-01/00CloudFactory-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/world/00CloudFactory-01/00CloudFactory-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/world/00CloudFactory-01/00CloudFactory-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/world/00CloudFactory-01/00CloudFactory-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e053e069-59b7-52b3-8e5c-9dbb757108e9" decoding="async" width="600" height="480"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tanks spelling out the Irving name at the oil refinery.

And Irving-owned transport trucks carry Irving-made goods, like structural steel and frozen French fries. An Irving-owned security company provides guards for Irving-owned properties.</p><p>Canada has many families that have built business empires, most notably the Thomson family, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/business/media/09reuters.html" title="">which controls Thomson-Reuters,</a> the media, financial and legal information company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But the Irvings stand out for their command of a single region. Starting in the 1920s with a general store and gas station that sold Ford Model Ts, Kenneth Colin Irving, who was known as K.C., established a privately owned family business now worth an estimated 14.5 billion Canadian dollars, or about $10.1 billion.<span>  </span></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The family’s legacy in Canada is complicated. Its companies have brought employment to a region where jobs are scarce. By some estimates, one out of every 10 people in New Brunswick works for an Irving company. Still, the province consistently ranks at or near the bottom in Canada for family income.</p><p>And while Irving companies have created large industries, its factories have also brought pollution to Saint John and blighted its neighborhoods, according to residents and former government officials.</p><p>But the family’s economic power and political influence have made many people in Saint John reluctant to openly criticize the Irvings. The family’s decision in 2003 to close its shipyard in Saint John, which once employed 4,000 people, to concentrate on its operation in Halifax, Nova Scotia was widely seen as a consequence of fractious labor relations. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Irving Oil’s headquarters in uptown Saint John.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Arthur Irving, who led Irving Oil for decades and died in 2024, discussed the future of the company during a rare public appearance in 2017.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Uptown Saint John before the construction of the new Irving Oil headquarters, which was completed in 2018.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There is a culture in Saint John of keeping your head down and keeping your mouth shut,” said Don Darling, the city’s mayor from 2016 to 2021.</p><p>He said he believed that Saint John’s strong industrial base should make the local economy stronger, but that the relatively low taxes on many Irving-owned businesses have made it difficult to support needed social services.</p><p>“I don’t blame the Irvings necessarily,’’ he added. “But everybody has to play a role and everyone should take responsibility for their part in the community.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Don Darling, the former mayor of Saint John, near the Irving Oil refinery.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The province of New Brunswick consistently ranks at or near the bottom in Canada for family income.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man in the Old North End neighborhood shows off his “Silence is golden” tattoo.

Irving bought about 20 houses near the pipeline and demolished them, apparently to create a buffer between the refinery and residents. The abandoned neighborhood is now blocked off by concrete barriers and patrolled by Irving-employed guards.</p><p>Like other people in Saint John, Lisa Crandall, who lives near the barriers, said she knew of family members and pets that had died from unusual cancers.</p><p>But there has been little scrutiny of any health issues related to the Irving company by local government agencies or private groups. A 2009 study for the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, an advocacy group, found that <a href="https://www.preventcancernow.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/ccnb2009.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lung cancer rates</a> for women in Saint John were 82 percent higher than national rates and 98 percent higher for men.</p><p>There have been no known studies directly linking health problems to Irving-owned businesses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lisa Crandall with her grandson Trey in the front yard of her home near the refinery.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trey playing outside Ms. Crandall’s home.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Crandall with her dogs. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The refinery has dusted <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-oil-dust-particulate-gordon-dalzell-air-1.4404962" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">neighborhoods with chemical particulate</a>. The provincial government has declared these <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-oil-dust-particulate-gordon-dalzell-air-1.4404962" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">releases of dust and soot to be low risk</a> to residents, but that has failed to reassure them. Fine particles have been linked to asthma, lung disease and bronchitis.</p><p>Ms. Crandall said she was frustrated by the lack of communications from the company. To date, she said, it has offered no information about the bulldozing of houses on her street.</p><p>“They don’t talk about it,” she said. “They just always send out a letter saying: Hi, we’re your neighbor. Sorry for the inconvenience.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>K.C. Irving began the family’s empire by adding an oil company to his car dealership and gas station. During the Great Depression, he took over failing bus and truck companies, and after World War II expanded to paper, ships and lumber.</p><p>The company’s growing influence brought concessions and tax breaks from government. In 1951, the province passed a law, which is no longer in force, allowing the Irving pulp mill to pour waste into the Saint John River. And Irving Oil was given a 42-year property tax exemption that ended in 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-39"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Patrons playing bingo at the Union Street Bingo Hall in uptown Saint John.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-40"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deer next to Milford Road on the west side of Saint John, in an area where the Irving Pulp and Paper mill is now expanding.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-41"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A home in Crescent Valley, a Saint John neighborhood made up of housing for lower-income people.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“The level of access to elected officials that they have is like that given to no one else,” said Mr. Darling, the former mayor. “Show us if it makes sense to give special tax treatment to any business — to the Irvings or anyone else.’’</p><p>Back on Pleasant City Street, Ms. Crandall said she wished there was some way to diminish Irving’s outsize presence in Saint John.</p><p>“I would love to see them just sell everything and have different companies come in,” she said.
