The Israeli government has said U.N. officials, including Mr. Guterres, have failed to criticize attacks against Israel in strong enough terms.</p><p>“Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran’s heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil,” Mr. Katz said in a statement on Wednesday. “Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity with or without António Guterres.”</p><p>Mr. Guterres has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/un-security-council-guterres-israel.html" title="">repeatedly condemned</a> the attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 and demanded that all hostages taken from Israel that day be released. He has also repeatedly called for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/24/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news" title="">cease-fire in Gaza</a> and criticized what he called the collective punishment of Palestinians in the enclave.</p><p>Following the Iranian missile attack against Israel on Tuesday — which was largely thwarted — Mr. Guterres wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/antonioguterres/status/1841167889191112704" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on social media</a>: “I condemn the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation. This must stop. We absolutely need a cease-fire.”</p><p>It was not clear whether Mr. Katz’s statement was a direct response to that post by Mr. Guterres.</p><p>The Israeli government, which had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/un-security-council-guterres-israel.html" title="">previously called</a> on Mr. Guterres to resign, has also said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/magazine/unrwa-gaza-war.html" title="">main U.N. agency</a> that aids Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, UNRWA, employs many people who are linked to Hamas and other militant groups, and has called for the agency to be disbanded.</p><p>The United States and other governments have condemned Iran for the attack on Tuesday — which Tehran said was in retaliation for the assassinations of leaders of its proxy groups Hamas and Hezbollah — and said they would stand by Israel.</p><p>The U.N. Security Council was scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday, in part to discuss the threat of a wider Middle East war.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel Invades Lebanon:</strong><strong> </strong>The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ground-invasion.html">began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon</a>, targeting what it said was Hezbollah military infrastructure in villages close to the Israel-Lebanon border.</p></li><li><p><strong>Striking on Multiple Fronts:</strong><strong> </strong>The escalation of violence between Israel and Iran-backed proxies across the Middle East <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-yemen-gaza.html">threatened to bring the combatants</a> closer to an all-out regional war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran Projects Caution: </strong>Leaders in Tehran suggested it would be the Lebanese militia that would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html">strike back at Israel</a> after the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, and bombings in Beirut.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden-Netanyahu Disconnect:</strong><strong> </strong>Israeli officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/us/politics/hezbollah-strike-nasrallah-biden-netanyahu.html">gave their American counterparts no advance warning</a> of the strike that killed Nasrallah.
