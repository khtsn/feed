After several days of work, the company is ready to try again what is to be largely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/science/spacex-starship-test-launch-7.html" title="">a do-over of the seventh flight</a>, which launched in January.</p><p>In that test, Starship’s mammoth booster, or the bottom of the rocket, successfully returned to the launchpad, but the upper-stage spacecraft disintegrated over the Caribbean, with some debris landing on the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about Thursday’s flight, which the company aims to bring to a less explosive conclusion</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-176f61f">When is the launch and how can I watch it?</h2><p>The launch is scheduled to occur during a one-hour window beginning at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time from Starbase, SpaceX’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/us/starbase-texas-city-elon-musk-spacex.html" title="">launch site in South Texas</a>. SpaceX will provide <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=starship-flight-8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coverage on its website</a> beginning about 40 minutes before liftoff.</p><h2 id="link-6284f793">What is Starship?</h2><p>The Starship rocket system is the largest ever built. At 403 feet tall, it’s nearly 100 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty atop its pedestal.</p><p>It has the most engines ever in a rocket booster: The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 of SpaceX’s Raptor engines. As those engines lift Starship off the launchpad, they will generate 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle.</p><p>The upper part, also called Starship or Ship for short, looks like a shiny rocket from science fiction movies of the 1950s, is made of stainless steel with large fins. This is the upper stage that will head toward orbit, and ultimately could carry people to the moon or even Mars.</p><p>In six tests before the seventh flight, SpaceX demonstrated that the rocket’s basic design works and the Starship can return to Earth almost intact. Over the coming year, SpaceX is looking to improve “more or less” to “reliably” and prove out other capabilities. The company is likely to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for up to 25 flights this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3885617">What went wrong during the 7th flight?</h2><p>The first part of the launch proceeded smoothly, with all 33 engines of the booster lifting the rocket toward space. The booster also separated properly, and the six engines of the second-stage spacecraft ignited, pushing it upward. But something went wrong, and air traffic over the Caribbean had to be diverted and delayed around the falling debris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>0:51</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Witness video appeared to show trails of flaming debris falling from the sky over the Caribbean.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“What’s —what is it then?” “What are those?” “Look up, everybody, look up.” “Whoa.

The company calls this area the “attic.”</p><p>Sensors recorded a rise in pressure indicating a leak, SpaceX said.</p><p>Two minutes later, there was another flash followed by fires in the attic, which caused all but one of the engines to shut down. Telemetry from the spacecraft ended eight minutes 20 seconds after liftoff.</p><p>SpaceX said that the probable cause was stronger than expected rhythmic oscillations. The vibrations caused leaks of propellant that could not be fully vented from the attic, leading to the fires.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>SpaceX said that, according to its analysis, the self-destruct system blew up the rocket a few minutes later.</p><h2 id="link-49b4122d">What did SpaceX change to fix those problems?</h2><p>The company said that feed lines carrying propellant to the engines were changed to reduce the oscillations. SpaceX also altered the propellant temperatures and thrust levels of the engines to avoid a repeat of the leaks.</p><p>For the rocket on this flight, SpaceX also added more vents to the attic section, and a system to purge the area of propellants in order to reduce the chance of fires.</p><p>The F.A.A. oversaw SpaceX’s investigation of what went wrong during the seventh test flight, and it issued a launch license on Friday for the eighth flight.</p><h2 id="link-22df0c57">What else will happen during this flight?</h2><p>While in space, Starship will test a new system that somewhat resembles a Pez candy dispenser. It will shoot out four dummy satellites that are similar in size and shape to spacecraft that will be deployed for SpaceX’s Starlink internet service. The dummy satellites will burn up in the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The flight also includes tests that aim to improve the ability of the upper stage to survive re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.</p><p>The rocket stage will pivot to a vertical orientation and simulate a landing over the water.</p><p>SpaceX will also try another catch of the Starship’s booster.</p><h2 id="link-67c7cab5">When will Starship be able to send people to space?</h2><p>NASA is planning to use a version of Starship to take astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon during its Artemis III mission, currently scheduled for 2027.</p><p>But that mission could be delayed, or even canceled, if the Trump administration revamps the moon program or shifts its attention to Mars.</p><p>SpaceX will need to demonstrate high reliability of Starship before a flight with people on board takes place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-147d042d">What else is going on with SpaceX?</h2><p>The company continues to launch its Falcon 9 rockets from Florida and California every few days. But it has also had some recent glitches with that launcher.</p><p>During launch in February, a Falcon 9 upper stage failed to execute the usual engine burn to ensure that the rocket’s remains would splash down in the ocean. Instead, it remained in orbit. Air resistance caused it to fall gradually, and the stage re-entered the atmosphere 18 days later over Europe. No one was hurt or injured, but pieces of the rocket appear to have landed in Poland.</p><p>SpaceX encountered another problem on Sunday night when a Falcon 9 booster successfully landed on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean but then fell over.</p><p>SpaceX reported that “an off-nominal fire in the aft end of the rocket damaged one of the booster’s landing legs which resulted in it tipping over.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/spacex">SpaceX</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What’s Up in Space and Astronomy</h2><h3>Keep track of things going on in our solar system and all around the universe.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Never miss a rocket launch, meteor shower, eclipse or other 2025 event that’s out of this world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2025/science/astronomy-space-calendar-events">our space and </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2025/science/astronomy-space-calendar-events">astronomy calendar</a>.</p></li><li><p>Scientists proposed an explanation for the formation of Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck near the lunar south pole, which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/science/moon-canyons.html">each about the size of Earth’s Grand Canyon</a>.</p></li><li><p>After NASA canceled its VIPER rover, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/science/nasa-moon-rover-astrolab-astrobotic.html">an empty space was available on a private spacecraft that will still head to the lunar surface</a>.
