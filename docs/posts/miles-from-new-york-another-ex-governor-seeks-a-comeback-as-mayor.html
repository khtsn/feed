His name became a punchline on late-night TV.</p><p>Years passed. Then political opportunity arose in the city where he was born. This time, he would run for mayor of his state’s most ethnically diverse and economically vital metropolis.</p><p>In this case, the city is not New York, although the tale is familiar there, too.</p><p>Jim McGreevey, a former governor of New Jersey, has staked his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/nyregion/mcgreevey-new-jersey-mayor-jersey-city.html" title="">claim at political rebirth</a> on a campaign for mayor of Jersey City. It comes two decades after he left Trenton, and just as Andrew M. Cuomo, New York’s former governor, is also running for mayor, of New York City.</p><p>Both men are Democrats, born in the same year, 1957. Both resigned in scandal. And both are competing against opponents running from the left, setting up a curious symmetry in the races to lead cities that are less than four miles apart, on opposite banks of the Hudson River.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If either candidate wins, he can thank an electorate that has grown far more inured to misdeeds by elected leaders, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor at the University of Houston who has studied political comebacks. “Scandals don’t hit like they used to,” he said.</p><p>As similar as the contests in Jersey City and New York might seem, there are also striking differences.</p><p>Unlike Mr. Cuomo, Mr. McGreevey is seen as the front-runner and is benefiting from the support of much of the local Democratic Party and the state’s governor, Philip D. Murphy. He has also raised far more money than his opponents.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo, on the other hand, lost the Democratic primary to a progressive assemblyman from Queens, Zohran Mamdani, and is now running as an independent. His <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/05/nyregion/nyc-mayoral-race-mamdani-cuomo-donations.html" title="">fund-raising has been sluggish</a>, and a new survey by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/nyregion/mayor-poll-mamdani-cuomo.html" title="">The New York Times and Siena University</a> showed him trailing Mr. Mamdani by about 22 points. President Trump, a Republican, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/nyregion/eric-adams-saudi-arabia-ambassador.html" title="">has made it clear</a> that he would like to see Mr. Cuomo’s other opponents — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/nyregion/adams-trump-job-quits.html" title="">Mayor Eric Adams</a>, a Democrat seeking re-election as an independent, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/03/nyregion/sliwa-beret-mayor-republican.html" title="">Curtis Sliwa</a>, a Republican who founded the Guardian Angels — drop out of the race, potentially boosting the former governor’s odds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andrew Cuomo, New York’s former governor, lost the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City to Zohran Mamdani, a state lawmaker from Queens.

With the field now set, Mr. McGreevey’s most notable opponents include Bill O’Dea, a county commissioner; James Solomon, a city councilman; Joyce Watterman, the City Council president; and Mussab Ali, a former president of the Jersey City school board.</p><p>The race is nonpartisan and there were no party primaries. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote on Nov. 4, the top two vote-getters will compete in a runoff, an outcome considered likely given the size of the field and the prominence of several of the candidates.</p><p>Mr. McGreevey, 68, rejects comparisons to Mr. Cuomo, who during the primary was criticized for running a low-energy campaign that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/nyregion/cuomo-mayor-campaign-strategy.html" title="">insulated him from scrutiny</a>.</p><p>The former New Jersey governor has been actively campaigning for mayor for nearly two years and said he enjoyed making his case to the public: “It’s the genetic blessing of being Irish.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the similarities have helped his opponents yoke him tightly to Mr. Cuomo, 67, who resigned four years ago after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/06/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-sexual-harassment-claims.html" title="">about a dozen women</a> accused him of sexual harassment. Mr. Cuomo has denied the claims.</p><p>Mr. McGreevey resigned in 2004, less than two years into his first term as governor. Standing next to his second wife, he announced that he was “a gay American” who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/nyregion/a-governor-resigns-overview-mcgreevey-steps-down-after-disclosing-a-gay-affair.html" title="">had had an affair with a male staff member</a>. The man had tried to use the information about the governor’s double life to blackmail him.</p><p>Jersey City is the largest municipality in Hudson County, a region often seen as synonymous with political corruption. (Robert Menendez, a former Democratic senator serving an 11-year prison sentence for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/nyregion/senator-bob-menendez-trial.html" title="">taking bribes</a>, cut his teeth here. And Frank Hague, a notorious 20th-century mayor of Jersey City, was known nationwide as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1949/05/12/archives/boss-hague-dislodged.html" title="">Boss Hague</a>.”)</p><p>Opponents of both former governors have called attention to their tainted exits from office. “I’ve spent my entire life in public service without any scandals,” Mr. O’Dea, 66, noted wryly about Mr. McGreevey’s comeback effort.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. McGreevey’s more progressive rivals have framed the race as a choice between an old guard beholden to corporate interests and a fresh generation of leaders, much as Mr. Mamdani has done.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I’ve spent my entire life in public service without any scandals,” said Bill O’Dea, a county commissioner running for mayor of Jersey City.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Solomon, a city councilman running for mayor, has represented downtown Jersey City since 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“You cannot create change by doubling down on politics as usual,” Mr. Solomon, 41, said soon after Mr. Mamdani’s primary victory. “That’s what you saw voters in New York City reject. They saw politics as usual and said: That will not deliver change.”</p><p>Jersey City, the state’s second-largest city, often battles to break free of New York’s shadow. And a key theme of Mr. Mamdani’s campaign — affordability — rings equally true here. It is a predominantly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/nyregion/st-peters-a-cinderella-story-that-began-in-jersey-city.html" title="">working-class community</a> that has drawn a large share of New York transplants, many of whom left in search of cheaper housing. Roughly <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Jersey_City_city,_Hudson_County,_New_Jersey?g=060XX00US3401736000#race-and-ethnicity" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40 percent</a> of its 300,000 residents were born outside the United States, and nearly three quarters of the population identifies as either Asian, Black or Latino.</p><p>In an ad during the primary, Mr. Mamdani noted that his policies might be the difference between being able to afford New York and “<a href="https://x.com/zohrankmamdani/status/1935889369165873512?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">having to move to Jersey City</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Ali, a progressive hoping to pull off an upset as stunning as Mr. Mamdani’s primary victory, was quick to offer a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLI0_IFSf9o/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">playful retort</a>, noting his willingness to “fight for a place that people want to hate on.” A Harvard Law School graduate born in Pakistan, Mr. Ali, 28, is courting younger voters and is fond of highlighting social media comments that refer to him as Mr. Mamdani’s “New Jersey clone.”</p><p>Jersey City is also a Democratic bastion, and Mr. McGreevey’s decision to take campaign contributions from donors supportive of Mr. Trump has led several of his opponents to question his ability to stand up to the president if elected.</p><p>“One of the core jobs of the Jersey City mayor is to push back against the extremism and authoritarianism of Donald Trump,” said Mr. Solomon, who since 2017 has represented downtown Jersey City, a neighborhood that’s closest to New York City and one of the most progressive areas of the city. “He’s shown a willingness to sell all of us out.”</p><p>Mr. McGreevey has depicted the backing he has received from both sides of the aisle as a virtue.</p><p>“Leadership means working with and listening to people from all walks of life, regardless of political affiliation,” he said. Then he borrowed a quote from Fiorello La Guardia, a former New York mayor: “There is no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage.”</p><p>Mr. McGreevey studied to become an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/nyregion/mcgreevey-out-of-politics-and-closet-hopes-to-join-clergy.html" title="">Episcopal priest</a> after his resignation and has spent much of the last two decades running job-training programs for people recently released from prison. If elected, he said his goal would be to live out Democratic values as a “bread and butter” mayor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It’s a return to doing basics well,” he said.</p><p>Every prominent candidate for mayor of Jersey City, including Mr. McGreevey, has made affordability a campaign cornerstone and promised to find ways to bring down housing costs and taxes. Those who grew up in the city — Mr. Ali, Mr. O’Dea and Ms. Watterman — have also emphasized their ties to the community.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-19"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mussab Ali, 28, is hoping to replicate Mr. Mamdani’s success as he runs for mayor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Fraser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“People want change,” said Joyce Watterman, Jersey City’s council president now competing for mayor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Fraser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Watterman, 67, said she believed that the races for mayor of Jersey City and New York would be defined more by the former governors’ lengthy careers in politics than by the reasons they resigned.</p><p>“They represent the old era,” Ms. Watterman said, “and people want change.”</p><p>Doris Ervin, who runs a restaurant in Jersey City that has been in her family for 30 years, agreed that voters in Hudson County tend to be uniquely thick-skinned when it comes to political corruption.</p><p>But she said that also puts them on high alert for authenticity.</p><p>“Is this really genuine?” she said of Mr. McGreevey’s ambition. “Or is this just another way of staying relevant?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>MB</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>In New Jersey, Ex-Governor Seeks a Political Rebirth<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
