It was unclear how they had been ignited, Sheriff McMahill said.</p><p>“There is no further threat to the community,” Sheriff McMahill said. As of Wednesday afternoon, there was no indication that the explosion was connected to ISIS, which President Biden said had inspired the New Orleans attack, but the investigation remains ongoing, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At a news conference on Wednesday, Jeremy Schwartz, the acting F.B.I. special agent in charge in Las Vegas, said the agency is investigating whether the explosion “was an act of terrorism or not.”</p><p>“I know everybody’s interested in that word and trying to see if we can say, ‘Hey this is a terrorist attack,’” Mr. Schwartz said. “That is our goal, and that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p><p>The Las Vegas Police Department received a report of an explosion at the Trump Hotel at about 8:40 a.m. local time.</p><p>Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1874579547452269054" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement on X</a> that “the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck,” and said the vehicle was functioning properly.</p><p>Police were told that a 2024 Cybertruck “pulled up to the last entrance doors of the hotel,” Sheriff McMahill said earlier, at a news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The driver was the only person in the truck, Mr. McMahill said, and had been killed inside the vehicle. At least seven others were reported to have sustained minor injuries.</p><p>The person’s body remained in the truck on Wednesday afternoon, Sheriff McMahill said, and the authorities were working on identification.</p><p>The authorities said that the truck had been rented in Colorado using Turo, the same car rental app used in the New Orleans attack. The authorities had been able to trace the car back to Colorado using video footage captured at charging stations, Sheriff McMahill said.</p><p>Sheriff McMahill said the authorities have identified the person who rented the truck but are not releasing their name.</p><p>The truck had arrived in Las Vegas at around 7:30 a.m. local time, Sheriff McMahill said, and had gone up and down Las Vegas Boulevard before immediately pulling into the Trump Hotel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a statement, a Turo spokesperson said the company is working with the authorities as they investigate both incidents.</p><p>“We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,” the spokesperson said in the statement.</p><p>Videos posted to social media showed what appeared to be a Tesla Cybertruck engulfed in flames just outside the hotel’s lobby entrance doors. Other social media posts showed what appeared to be a line of people being led out of the building.</p><p>“Earlier today, a reported electric vehicle fire occurred in the porte cochère of Trump Las Vegas,” Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump’s son and a leader of the Trump Organization, <a href="https://x.com/EricTrump/status/1874514306848440399" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement on X</a>. “The safety and well-being of our guests and staff remain our top priority.”</p><p>The same message was posted by the Trump Las Vegas’s social media account. People who were staying at the hotel said they had been evacuated because of the fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Oscar Terol, who was visiting the United States from Barcelona, said that he was walking toward the hotel entrance with his wife when he stopped at a food cart right before the explosion occurred. “Those 10 seconds were the difference,” he said.</p><p>He and his wife stumbled backward and Mr. Terol saw a vehicle with flames and an array of colors shooting out of it, which he assumed were fireworks.</p><p>Todd Hansen was on the 27th floor of the hotel when he said he had heard a series of loud popping sounds. He took the elevator down to a waiting area, where he saw smoke and sprinklers spraying in the driveway outside the hotel entrance.</p><p>“The elevator area was full of people,” Mr. Hansen said. “They would not let you out of the elevator area and into the lobby.” He went back to his room to alert his wife and they were both evacuated when they returned downstairs, he added.</p><p>Shir Poli, of San Antonio, said that he had noticed a gas-like smell on the floor and in the elevator. He had managed to take his luggage with him as evacuations were underway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Kerri Ford, of Wisconsin, said she had left her room for a cup of coffee when she was told to leave the building. She was set to be married on Wednesday afternoon, and her wedding dress and marriage license were left in the room.</p><p>“We didn’t know there was anything going on,” Ms. Ford said. “We just happened to come down for coffee and they’re like, ‘You have to evacuate.’”</p><p>The incident comes as Mr. Musk has cultivated a close and highly public relationship with President-elect Donald J. Trump. Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-mar-a-lago.html" title="">has been using a cottage</a> at Mar-a-Lago.
