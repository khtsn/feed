    <h1>Israel Strikes Humanitarian Zone in Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video on social media, verified by The New York Times, captured a projectile and a large explosion. The projectile hits the ground with a deafening boom, and people can be seen running away as a cloud of dust flies into the sky.</p><p>Other video from the scene captured the aftermath of the explosion, showing a large crater and damage to a number of tents.</p><p>The international aid group Doctors Without Borders said that one of its clinics, which was about 250 yards from where the strike hit, was also damaged and medical equipment destroyed.</p><p>Gabriella Bianchi, a spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders, said that the aid group had not received any direct warning that a blast was imminent. Residents who received alerts on their phones from the Israeli military did inform the staff, Ms. Bianchi said, but that left only a few minutes to evacuate personnel and hundreds of patients.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/MSF/status/1856784144593789149" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement on social media</a>, Doctors Without Borders condemned the attack, saying, “The use of heavy weapons in zones declared by Israeli authorities as safe, is further proof of the blatant disregard for Palestinian lives and humanitarian law.”</p></div></div>
