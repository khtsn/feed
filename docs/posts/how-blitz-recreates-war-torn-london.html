Drowning in his coat, he wears a flat cap and a stoic expression, striding toward his future as an evacuee. The photograph, taken during the eight-month-long bombardment of British cities by German forces during World War II, was one of the images that inspired Steve McQueen’s new film “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/movies/blitz-review.html" title="">Blitz</a>,” currently in select theaters.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The boy, carrying his small suitcase as he evacuated London in 1940, inspired the character of George in “Blitz.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The film is told from the perspective of George (Elliott Heffernan), a biracial 9-year-old who is evacuated from London to the countryside as bombs descend on his hometown. Mid-journey, he escapes the train, abandoning his suitcase and weaving his way back to his mother, Rita (Saoirse Ronan), in east London.</p><p>Doing research for the film, McQueen and its production designer, Adam Stockhausen, were struck again and again by “the incongruity, and the heartbreak,” of images of life in London during the bombing, Stockhausen said in a recent interview. McQueen would see a photo of a woman sweeping out her ruined house or one of a man sitting in a chair and smoking a cigarette, the home around him reduced to rubble, and build a scene around it, Stockhausen added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The film’s production design is meticulous — Stockhausen previously collaborated with McQueen on “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/movies/12-years-a-slave-holds-nothing-back-in-show-of-suffering.html" title="">12 Years a Slave</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/movies/widows-review.html" title="">Widows</a>” — and seen through George’s eyes, 1940s London is a sprawling labyrinth. Depicting the sweep of the city was essential to the narrative, Stockhausen said, but shooting entirely in London would have been too difficult and expensive, and the team wanted to avoid a C.G.I. set.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adam Stockhausen, left, the film’s production designer, and Steve McQueen, the director, working on set.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Apple</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>So “Blitz” was also shot on location in other British towns, including Hull and Chatham — and on a soundstage.
