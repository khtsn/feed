Some longtime employees, who have been with Whole Foods since well before Amazon bought the chain in 2017, said reductions in workers’ benefits and cuts in staffing levels when Amazon took over, among other changes, had been sources of frustration.</p><p>But those leading the union campaign hinted at a broader goal: to inspire a wave of organizing across the chain, adding to union drives among warehouse workers and delivery drivers that Amazon is already combating.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I expect others to follow, and that will increase the leverage that we have at the bargaining table,” said Ben Lovett, an employee at the Philadelphia store who has led the organizing. “We’ve shown them that it’s possible to organize at Amazon.”</p><p>The successful bid to form a union comes against a backdrop of what several workers have described as a campaign of intimidation from Whole Foods. They pointed to ramped-up monitoring of employees and anti-union messaging in the store since workers went public with their organizing efforts in the fall.</p><p>Whole Foods said in a statement that the company is “disappointed” by the election results, but that it offers competitive compensation and benefits for employees and that it is “committed to maintaining a positive working environment” at the Philadelphia store. </p><p>“This fight is far from over, but today’s victory is an important step forward,” Wendell Young IV, president of U.F.C.W. Local 1776, said in a statement. “We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers’ needs and priorities.”</p><p>In unfair labor practice charges filed with the labor board earlier this month, U.F.C.W. Local 1776, which represents food and retail workers in Pennsylvania, accused Whole Foods of firing an employee in retaliation for supporting the union drive. The union also accused the chain of excluding the store’s employees from receiving a raise that had been given this month to all its other workers in the Philadelphia area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Whole Foods said it had complied with all legal requirements when communicating with employees about unions. The company denied allegations of retaliation, arguing that it could not legally change wages during the election process and that it had delayed a raise until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence votes.</p><p>“A union is not needed at Whole Foods Market,” the company said in a statement ahead of the election, adding that it recognized employees’ right to “make an informed decision.”</p><p>The vote in Philadelphia was the latest outcome in organized labor’s efforts to gain a foothold in Amazon’s sprawling operations.</p><p>In 2022, workers on Staten Island voted to form Amazon’s first union in the United States; it is now affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Amazon has challenged the election outcome in court, and has refused to recognize or bargain with the union. Delivery drivers, who work for third-party package delivery companies serving Amazon, have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/economy/amazon-delivery-drivers-labor-nlrb.html" title="">mounted campaigns</a> with the Teamsters.</p><p>Last week, Amazon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/technology/amazon-quebec-closures.html" title="">said it was closing</a> all of its warehouse and logistics operations in Quebec, the Canadian province where unions had gained a foothold among some Amazon workers, and would lay off 1,700 employees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The union push in Amazon’s grocery business resembles, in certain ways, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/business/economy/starbucks-union-strike.html" title="">union organizing at Starbucks</a> that has spread to more than 500 stores in the United States since 2021, said Brishen Rogers, a labor law professor at Georgetown University.</p><p>In grocery stores and coffee shops, employees work side by side, day after day, in conditions that are often conducive to getting to know one another and forming networks of solidarity, he said. Those dynamics do not always exist in warehouses, where workers tend to be under constant surveillance.</p><p>“I would not be shocked,” Mr. Rogers said, “if it had a snowball effect across different Whole Foods locations, much like Starbucks.”</p><p>Ed Dupree, who works at the Whole Foods store in Philadelphia and has been involved in the union campaign there, said he was in touch with workers at other locations across the country who were interested in unionizing. At least 10 other Whole Foods locations have started to organize, he said.</p><p>The new political landscape in Washington may pose hurdles for the Philadelphia workers as they try to negotiate a contract, or for other stores that might file for union elections. After the Biden administration’s embrace of unions, President Trump is expected to appoint a new N.L.R.B. general counsel whose approach could make it harder for organizing campaigns to succeed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Employers typically exploit weaknesses in federal labor law to avoid reaching a first contract with newly unionized employees, said Kate Andrias, a professor of labor and employment law at Columbia University. Legal barriers to organizing and bargaining exist regardless of the government’s stance on labor, though companies might feel more emboldened to intimidate workers under President Trump, she said.</p><p>“We’re likely to see the law become less favorable to workers during the Trump administration,” Ms. Andrias said. But, she added, “even in periods when there have been hostile labor boards in the past, workers have been successful in organizing unions.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
