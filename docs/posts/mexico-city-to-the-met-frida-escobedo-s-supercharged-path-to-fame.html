Despite the weight of being the first woman to design a wing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 154-year history — and, at 45, relatively young for such a major architectural commission — Escobedo has brought a bold conviction to her vision for the museum’s new Modern and contemporary art galleries, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/arts/design/met-museum-frida-escobedo-architecture-tang-wing-art.html" title="">unveiled</a> last month.</p><p>“I have a soft personality,” Escobedo said in a recent interview at her West Village design studio. “But I can be very persistent.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>This muted forcefulness seems to have enabled Escobedo to navigate a project that could intimidate even the most experienced architects, given the daunting array of stakeholders with strong opinions — from the Met’s trustees and curators to city government officials (the museum occupies public land) to the protectors of Central Park, into which the wing thrusts.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/07frida-escobedo-jqfh/07frida-escobedo-jqfh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/07frida-escobedo-jqfh/07frida-escobedo-jqfh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/07frida-escobedo-jqfh/07frida-escobedo-jqfh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A rendering of the new wing of the Met, abutting Central Park, set off by terraces and greenery." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/07frida-escobedo-jqfh/07frida-escobedo-jqfh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/07frida-escobedo-jqfh/07frida-escobedo-jqfh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/07frida-escobedo-jqfh/07frida-escobedo-jqfh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/07frida-escobedo-jqfh/07frida-escobedo-jqfh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/1ef58e4a-e6fa-5263-b316-2ef9c1b602dd" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Viewed from its southwest corner, Frida Escobedo’s rendering of the Tang Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, housing Modern and contemporary works.

She spoke about current projects — a new home for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/theater/national-black-theater-dasha-zhukova.html" title="">National Black Theater</a> in Harlem with the New York City-based Handel Architects; a <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2024/06/moreau-kusunoki-frida-escobedo-centre-pompidou-renovation-plans/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major overhaul of the Pompidou Center</a> in Paris with the French studio Moreau Kusunoki; a <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2024/03/frida-escobedo-unveils-bergen-boerum-hill-first-residential-project-new-york/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">residential project in the Boerum Hill</a> neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p><p>The office, where her New York staff of 15 clicked away at their computers, was clean, uncluttered and calm.

She spends half her time in Mexico City and says its influences are deeply ingrained, along with the spirit of independence that drove her to establish an architectural practice in Mexico City at just 23 years old.</p><p>“I never worked for another studio,” she said. “I started my office when I was very young, and then of course there was very little money to develop the projects that I was trying to do. The idea of trying to do more with less was always present, and how to achieve that with simple materials and rather than depending on supersophisticated detailing or rich, complicated finishes.</p><p>“It was more about the big gesture,” she continued. “What does it say? How do you play with light and these other more simple means to achieve something that feels interesting and engaging?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Civic Stage designed by Escobedo for the Lisbon Architecture Triennale, 2013, Lisbon, Portugal, rises higher as the audience grows.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Frida Escobedo Studio; Photo by Delfino Legnani</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Escobedo was hardly a household name when she was selected in 2022 to design the Met’s new wing, which had been through several false starts before finally gaining momentum.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Her body of work consisted mostly of temporary structures, such as those for the Lisbon Architecture Triennale, the Chicago Architecture Biennial and <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/05/28/frida-escobedo-aztec-installation-landscape-victoria-albert-courtyard-london/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in London.

It’s very challenging,” she said. “People don’t have the same level of trust in a young woman as, say, an older-age guy. So it’s difficult to get commissions.”</p><p>Rather than be cowed by such doubters, however, Escobedo has consistently set out to defy them. “I’ll prove you wrong, I can make it,” she said. “I needed to say something and to do something.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Escobedo spends half her time in Mexico City and says its influences are deeply ingrained, along with the spirit of independence that led her to establish an architectural practice at just 23. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Born in 1979 in Mexico City to a doctor father and sociologist mother, young Frida was always working with her hands — drawing or making models — but was wary about becoming an artist.</p><p>“Expressing yourself and your emotions, and transforming it into something that you want to present to someone always felt a little bit intimidating,” she said. “So design and art felt like a safer ground for me.”</p><p>Escobedo studied architecture at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City before completing a master’s degree in <a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/master-in-design-studies-mdes-pre-fall-2021/art-and-the-public-domain/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">art, design and the public domain</a> at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The Harvard program, in which she was surrounded by artists, scientists and designers, “changed my life,” Escobedo said.</p><p>“It was showing me that it was true: Architecture was not just about developing housing or doing retail or hospitality or these very traditional things,” she said. “It could be something else. You could be doing an installation, it could be doing furniture, it could be writing about it, it could be doing performance. All of these were talking about space.”</p><p>That multidisciplinary sensibility has informed Escobedo’s approach to design. “It’s amazing to talk to an architect who has also an artist mind,” said Petrit Halilaj, the Kosovan artist who created last <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/28/arts/design/petrit-kalilaj-art-met-museum-roof.html" title="">year’s Met rooftop commission</a>. “You can talk about space or color or love.” Halilaj first met Escobedo at the 2013 Lisbon Architecture Triennale, where she had designed <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/civic-stage-by-frida-escobedo-12-03-2013/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a circular sloping stage</a> that elevates the performer as the audience grows.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Escobedo-designed expansion of La Tallera Siqueiros, a museum, workshop and artist’s residence in Cuernavaca, Mexico.

While she has welcomed input, Escobedo has also defended her design decisions, such as the varying heights of the galleries. And she has managed to walk the line between carefully honoring the Met’s history and courageously rethinking its approach to the art of our time.</p><p>“Being a good listener at an institution of this scale has really helped her,” said Breslin, the Met curator, who is reassembling the collection that will fill the 70,000 square feet of galleries (the project also includes about 18,600 square feet of terraces, as well as a cafe and new staircases). “There is a poise and equanimity that you also see in the rigor of her architecture. What she does is help provide order and calm and balance to a series of spaces where the idea will be to create rupture.</p><p>“It’s a quiet confidence,” he added. “It’s understated, but it is extremely present.”</p><p>Much like her personality, Escobedo’s design for the new wing is not attention seeking or noisy.
