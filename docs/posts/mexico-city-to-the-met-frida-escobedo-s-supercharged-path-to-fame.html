You could be doing an installation, it could be doing furniture, it could be writing about it, it could be doing performance.

What she does is help provide order and calm and balance to a series of spaces where the idea will be to create rupture.</p><p>“It’s a quiet confidence,” he added. “It’s understated, but it is extremely present.”</p><p>Much like her personality, Escobedo’s design for the new wing is not attention seeking or noisy. Instead, she seems to be approaching the project as a gentle process of evolution rather than a radical revision.</p><p>“One of the things that I’m interested in is this idea of architecture as being a living thing, that it is constantly changing and shifting and that it needs to adapt and it’s not fixed,” she said. “That’s a condition for every aspect of life: Nothing is permanent.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-35"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Robin Pogrebin, who has been a reporter for The Times for nearly 30 years, covers arts and culture.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robin-pogrebin">More about Robin Pogrebin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>C</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p> Mexico City  To Manhattan, By Design<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/metropolitan-museum-of-art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/max-hollein">Max Hollein</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Art and Museums in New York City</h2><h3>A guide to the shows, exhibitions and artists shaping the city’s cultural landscape.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Acid Comedy of Thomas Schütte:</strong> In a MoMA retrospective <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/arts/design/thomas-schutte-art-humor-moma-sculpture.html">filled with humorous angst</a>, the German sculptor offers a prime 2025 resolution: Don’t run from failure.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Turn to the Cosmos:</strong> The artist Lorna Simpson’s show at Hauser &amp; Wirth in Chelsea is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/arts/design/lorna-simpson-hauser-wirth-meteorite-paintings-cosmos-art.html">constellation of galactic and human history</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>His Painting Does the Talking:</strong> Marlon Mullen’s show at MoMA, the first by a developmentally disabled artist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/arts/design/marlon-mullen-moma.html">speaks volumes</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Once-Sinful, Now Safe:</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/arts/luna-luna-art-carnival-the-shed.html">New York version of Luna Luna</a>, an art carnival, has lost the anarchic charge it was born with almost four decades ago, though a new act may thrill the kids.</p></li><li><p><strong>Looking for More Art?:</strong> Here are the gallery shows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/arts/nyc-galleries-january.html">not to miss in January</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
