		<p>The first day of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2449/esports-world-cup-2025" target="_blank">Esports World Cup</a>&#39;s Valorant event kicked off, playing host to rookie debuts, new-look rosters, blockbuster matchups, and a handful of upsets.</p>

<p>In a format similar to Champions, 16 teams competed in four-team groups with one team from each representative region in a double-elimination bracket. The opening matches were played in a Best-of-1 format, and the winners of the opening matches moved on to play in a Best-of-3 later in the day to secure qualification for the playoffs.</p>

<p>In their Best-of-3 match to qualify for playoffs, Paper Rex dominated Karmine Corp 2-0. After initially facing some troubles on their map pick of Lotus, Paper Rex bounced back from down 10-6, snatching seven straight rounds to win 13-10. On KC&#39;s pick of Icebox, Paper Rex continued to ride that wave, ending their defender-sided first half up 10-2 to en route to a clean 13-5 victory.</p>

</span>. Xi Lai, who themselves were dealing with personnel complications, played with head coach <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/1348/hvoya">
		hvoya	</a>
</span> in the starting roster. Flicker showed no signs of debut jitters, dominating the server with a match-leading 19 kills to help DRX to a dominant 13-6 victory on Haven.</p>

<p>BBL and DRX&#39;s match started out on BBL&#39;s pick of Sunset, a map that DRX has only played three times since its reintroduction to the map pool. The map was back and forth, with both teams trading rounds in quick succession. Both teams only won around half of their full buys, a sign of how much effectiveness both teams found from their half and low-buy rounds. BBL went on to win 14-12 in overtime.</p>

<p>DRX&#39;s pick of Ascent was a streaky one. After winning the pistol and anti-eco, BBL went on to win six straight defender-sided rounds. DRX closed the half on a high note, winning four straight of their own to make matters even at halftime. That streakiness continued as BBL began its attacking side. Seven straight rounds were won by the European squad, shutting the defending DRX out to win 13-6 and secure playoffs.</p>

<p><em>DRX had no answers for BBL&#39;s attack.</em></p>

<p>LewN had yet another impressive performance, racking up a match-high 42 kills, including 13 first bloods. His 24 kills on Ascent were unmatched by anybody else in the server, as nobody else had more than 15.</p>

<p>BBL will move on to the playoffs, while DRX awaits the winner of Xi Lai Gaming and Sentinels&#39; match.</p>

The match on Lotus was never quite close, as NRG opened dominantly on their attacker side, giving up just four rounds to Team Heretics&#39; Sentinel-free comp.

The game was played on Sunset, and saw RRQ return to the form they hit during their trophy-lifting <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 1</a> campaign. Titan, meanwhile, struggled with a new-look roster. Replacing veteran <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/488/rb">
		Rb	</a>
</span> with rookie <span data-ref-id="22">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/19677/lucas">

</span>, the Chinese squad faltered in their first-ever appearance outside of China. Spearheaded by a combined 40 kills from <span data-ref-id="23">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="24">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/1430/crazyguy">
		crazyguy	</a>
</span>, RRQ won 13-6.</p>

<p>After winning their respective opening matches in dominant fashion, NRG and RRQ clashed heads with a playoff spot on the line. On both maps, RRQ opted for aggressive, double-Duelist team comps, with <span data-ref-id="25">

</span> on Waylay and Neon.</p>

<p>On the opening map of Split, Monyet&#39;s Waylay disrupted NRG, tallying up team-highs with 19 kills and four first bloods. However, the stars of the show were on the other side of the stage. Veteran <span data-ref-id="27">

</span> and newcomer <span data-ref-id="28">

		skuba	</a>
</span> combined for 44 kills, including 19 of the team&#39;s 35 on the attacker side to help wrap up a 13-7 victory.</p>

<p>After giving up six rounds to the attacking NRG on the large, attacker-sided Pearl, RRQ will have felt good about their chances in the second half. Even with two Duelists to lead the charge, RRQ ran into troubles, whether it be <span data-ref-id="29">

As the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2380/vct-2025-emea-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">EMEA Stage 1</a> champions moved to defense, the tides changed. 100 Thieves won six of the next seven rounds to cut the deficit to one, threatening to flip the map on its head.

</span>. It was the same map that they blew an 11-4 lead to G2 Esports to be eliminated from Toronto, but a rejuvenated Gen.G made sure it didn&#39;t happen a second time. A strong defender side to open the game gave the Koreans a 9-3 lead to enter halftime, with Sentinel player <span data-ref-id="36">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11600/foxy9">
		Foxy9	</a>
</span> scoring 18 kills in the half alone. He&#39;d finish with a game-high 24 as Gen.G captured a 13-4 win, tying the biggest margin of victory in the opening round.</p>

<p>In a rematch from the playoffs of Masters Toronto, Gen.G and FNATIC met in a match for the ages. Gen.G, on their pick of Ascent, claimed a 9-3 lead after a dominant defender side, but FNATIC did not back down without a fight. A dominant defender side of their own helped FNATIC mount a comeback, reaching match point at 12-11, only for Gen.G to force overtime. In overtime, the race to win an attacker round was won by FNATIC, who claimed a 15-13 victory. </p>

<p>The series then moved to FNATIC&#39;s Icebox, a map that both teams won in their opening matches. While FNATIC staved off a comeback attempt from 100 Thieves to win 13-11, Gen.G put up a dominant defender side to win 13-7. After winning seven rounds on attack, a dominant defender side was all that Gen.G needed to secure the victory and playoffs. However, Gen.G had no answers for FNATIC&#39;s attack. The double-Sentinel comp pairing Chronicle&#39;s Sage and <span data-ref-id="38">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span>&#39;s Killjoy made it tough for Gen.G to retake the site. FNATIC did not drop a single round in the second half, winning eight straight to claim a 13-7 victory and their spot in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Gen.G will await the winner of the elimination match between 100 Thieves and EDward Gaming.</p>
