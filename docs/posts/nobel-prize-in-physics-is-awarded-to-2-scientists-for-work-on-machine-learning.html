Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks,” the Nobel Committee for Physics announced.</p><p>“This year’s physics laureates’ breakthroughs stand on the foundations of physical science,” the committee <a href="https://x.com/NobelPrize/status/1843589689720062428" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>. “They have showed a completely new way for us to use computers to aid and to guide us to tackle many of the challenges our society face.”</p><p>In announcing the award, the committee noted that machine learning “has long been important for research, including the sorting and analysis of vast amounts of data.”</p><p>“John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton used tools from physics to construct methods that helped lay the foundation for today’s powerful machine learning,” the committee said. “Machine learning based on artificial neural networks is currently revolutionizing science, engineering and daily life.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Journalists in the room took turns asking Dr. Hinton questions about his work, and he expressed worries over machine learning and said it would have an extraordinary influence on society.</p><p>“It will be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,” he said. “Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it’s going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it’s like to have things smarter than us.”</p><p>While Dr. Hinton expressed his concerns, he shared that the advanced technology would bring much better health care. “It’ll mean huge improvements in productivity,” he said. “But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.”</p><h2 id="link-34a84e30">Who are the winners?</h2><p>Dr. Hinton, born just outside London, has mostly lived and worked in the United States and Canada since the late 1970s. He recently retired from his job as a researcher and vice president at Google — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html" title="">in part, he said, so that he could speak freely about the rise of A.I.</a> — and is a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto.</p><p>Dr. Hinton began researching neural networks as a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh in the early 1970s, a time when few researchers believed in the idea. Forty years later, Dr. Hinton doubled down on the concept, starting a new effort with the help of other researchers to tackle the technology with backing from the Canadian government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>After Dr. Hinton and two of his graduate students made a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/technology/artificial-intelligence-research-toronto.html" title="">breakthrough with the technology in 2012</a>, he joined Google. In 2019 — together with Yoshua Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal whose research focuses on ensuring that A.I. is developed safely, and Yann LeCun, the chief A.I. scientist at Meta — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/technology/turing-award-ai.html" title="">he received the Turing Award</a>, often called the “Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on neural networks.</p><p>John J. Hopfield, a Chicago native, is an emeritus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/03/science/a-rule-of-thumb-that-unscrambles-the-brain.html" title="">professor at Princeton known for seminal discoveries in computer science, biology and physics</a>.</p><h2 id="link-5b581625">Why did the committee say the scientists were receiving the prize?</h2><p>Both laureates helped lay the foundation for machine learning, the committee said. Dr. Hopfield “created a structure that can store and reconstruct information,” it said, while Dr. Hinton “invented a method that can independently discover properties in data and which has become important for the large artificial neural networks now in use.”</p><h2 id="link-1e75708">What did the laureates say about winning the prize?</h2><p>Dr. Hinton told the committee by telephone on Tuesday that he was “flabbergasted” by the news of receiving the award. “I had no idea this would happen.”</p><p>Dr. Hinton, who said he was speaking from a “cheap hotel” in California, said the news had come like a bolt from the blue. “I was going to get an M.R.I. scan today, but I think I’ll have to cancel that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-2d80d230">Who received the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics?</h2><p>The prize was shared by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/science/nobel-prize-physics.html" title="">Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier</a> for work that let scientists capture the motions of subatomic particles moving at impossible speeds.</p><h2 id="link-52173fda">Who else has received a Nobel Prize in the sciences this year?</h2><p>On Monday, the prize in Physiology or Medicine went to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/health/nobel-prize-medicine.html" title="">Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun</a> for their discovery of microRNA, which helps determine how cells develop and function.</p><h2 id="link-37aa440f">When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced?</h2><ul><li><p>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be awarded on Wednesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, the prize went to Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexei I. Ekimov for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/science/nobel-prize-chemistry.html" title="">discovering and developing quantum dots</a> that are expected to lead to advances in electronics, solar cells and encrypted quantum information.</p></li><li><p>The Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded on Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/05/books/nobel-prize-literature" title="">Jon Fosse of Norway</a> was honored for plays and prose that gave “voice to the unsayable.”</p></li><li><p>The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/06/world/nobel-peace-prize" title="">Narges Mohammadi</a>, an activist in Iran, was recognized “for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.” Ms. Mohammadi is serving a 10-year sentence in an Iranian prison where her attorneys have raised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/middleeast/iran-narges-beaten-prison.html" title="">concerns about her well-being</a>.</p></li><li><p>Next week, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be awarded on Monday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/economy/claudia-goldin-nobel-prize-economics.html" title="">Claudia Goldin</a> was awarded for her research uncovering the reasons for gender gaps in labor force participation and earnings.</p></li></ul><p>All of the prize announcements are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NobelPrize" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">streamed live</a> by the Nobel Prize organization.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Derrick Bryson Taylor covers breaking and trending news and is based in London.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/derrick-bryson-taylor">More about Derrick Bryson Taylor</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Cade Metz writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cade-metz">More about Cade Metz</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
