capital Damascus, the seat of power of President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>The swift advance on Hama, one of Syria’s largest cities, and the retreat of government forces were confirmed by both the rebels and the government. The advance came just days after the rebels extended their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-rebels-control.html" title="">control over Aleppo</a>, a major hub in northern Syria.</p><p>In a video circulated by the rebel group leading the offensive, their leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, jubilantly calls for the rebels to push on toward other Syrian cities, including the capital.</p><p>“The people of Homs, prepare yourselves,” he said in the video, which his group said was filmed on Wednesday. “The people of Damascus, the people of Dara’a, the people of Deir al Zour. Victory for all, God willing.” The New York Times could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video or when it was filmed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/middleeast/syria-map-control.html" title="">sudden rebel advance</a> has shifted the front lines in Syria’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/world/middleeast/syria-recovery-aleppo-douma.html" title="">13-year-old civil war</a> for the first time in years, adding a new layer of unpredictability to a conflict that has ravaged the country, opened voids exploited by jihadist groups, drawn in world powers including Russia and the United States and created a long-term refugee crisis for neighboring countries.</p><p>Hama is one of the few major Syrian cities where rebels had yet to seize significant control during the civil war, which began with a popular uprising aimed at ousting Mr. al-Assad in 2011.</p><p>The city’s name is synonymous with one of the most notorious massacres in the Middle East. In 1982, security forces serving the president’s father and predecessor, Hafez al-Assad, massacred thousands of people there during an anti-government uprising led by the Muslim Brotherhood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="syria-control-map-dec-2-dhkor" data-id="100000009858474" data-source-id="100000009858474"><div slug="syria-control-map-dec-2-dhkor" data-sourceid="100000009858474" id="embed-id-100000009858474">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Analysts have attributed the rebels’ surprise success to the cumulative attrition of the war on Mr. al-Assad’s forces and to the fact that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-offensive-iran-russia.html" title="">foreign allies who have intervened</a> powerfully on his behalf — notably Russia, Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah — are now preoccupied with their own crises.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, is recovering from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-ceasefire.html" title="">a war with Israel</a> that killed many of its leaders and displaced many of its supporters. And Russia — which dispatched its military to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html" title="">bomb rebel areas</a>, turning the war’s tide in favor of Mr. al-Assad years ago — has diverted its attention toward its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p><p>The rebels behind the offensive are a combination of forces led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, which evolved from an affiliate of Al Qaeda that was notorious early in the war for suicide attacks on government troops. The group says it has cut ties with the global terrorist organization, but it is still classified as a terrorist group by the United States and other countries.</p><p>Other groups backed by Turkey and based in Syrian territory just south of the Turkish border have also joined in the fight.</p><p>While the rebel advance has taken the Syrian government and many regional observers by surprise, the rebels in the north have been preparing for it for some time and even talked openly about it.</p><p>Sam Heller, a fellow at the Century Foundation who studies Syria, said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>’s position as the de facto government in Idlib Province, which abuts the Turkish border, gave it an opportunity to collect fees on trade and other services in the area. At least some of that money seems to have gone to military preparation to expand, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“They have been bottled up in Idlib but with space to organize and to train, and they have accrued a lot of resources from trade and economic activity in that area,” he said. “And it seems that they have invested that responsibly.”</p><p>The rebels announced on Thursday that they were entering Hama, one of Syria’s largest cities. A rebel commander, Lt. Col. Hassan Abdulghany, said in a social media statement that government forces were in “a significant state of confusion,” with soldiers and commanders abandoning their posts.</p><p>In a video statement posted on social media, Mr. al-Jolani, the leader of the rebel offensive, said his forces had entered Hama “to cleanse that wound that has persisted in Syria for 40 years,” referring to the authoritarian rule of Mr. al-Assad and his father before him.</p><p>“I ask God that it be a conquest in which there is no revenge, but rather a conquest full of mercy and love.”</p><p>The Syrian military issued its own statement, saying its forces had fought for several days to repel the rebels in battles that had killed many combatants on both sides. But on Thursday, the rebels broke through, the statement said, so the military withdrew to avoid battles inside the city that would endanger civilians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group based in Britain, said the rebels had taken over the police command headquarters, an air base and the central prison, from which they had freed hundreds of people.</p><p>While the rebel advance remains far from Damascus, its speed has unnerved some of Syria’s international allies.</p><p>The Chinese embassy in Damascus issued a statement saying “the overall security situation is deteriorating further” and advised Chinese citizens to leave the country as soon as possible.</p><p>Jacob Roubai<!-- --> contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Hubbard is the Istanbul bureau chief, covering Turkey and the surrounding region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-hubbard">More about Ben Hubbard</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Rebels In Syria Storm Key City<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/bashar-alassad">Bashar al-Assad</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/05/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-offensive-hama.html">309</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/05/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-offensive-hama.html">309</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
