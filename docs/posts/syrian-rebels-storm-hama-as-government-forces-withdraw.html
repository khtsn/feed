    <h1>Syrian Rebels Storm Hama as Government Forces Withdraw</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, is recovering from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-ceasefire.html" title="">a war with Israel</a> that killed many of its leaders and displaced many of its supporters. And Russia — which dispatched its military to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html" title="">bomb rebel areas</a>, turning the war’s tide in favor of Mr. al-Assad years ago — has diverted its attention toward its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p><p>The rebels behind the offensive are a combination of forces led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, which evolved from an affiliate of Al Qaeda. But the group says it has cut ties with the global terrorist organization. Other groups backed by Turkey and based in Syrian territory just south of the Turkish border have also joined in the fight.</p><p>The rebels announced on Thursday that they were entering Hama, one of Syria’s largest cities. A rebel commander, Lt. Col. Hassan Abdulghany, said in a social media statement that government forces were in “a significant state of confusion,” with soldiers and commanders abandoning their posts.</p><p>The Syrian military issued its own statement, saying that its forces had withdrawn from the city after rebels broke through its defenses.</p></div></div>
