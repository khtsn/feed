The court said it “manifestly lacks jurisdiction.”</p><p>The International Court of Justice did not rule on the allegations made by the Sudanese government, but by a 14-2 vote, it declined to issue the provisional emergency measures against the U.A.E. that Sudan had requested. By a 9-7 vote, it officially removed the case from its docket, according to a <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/197/197-20250505-ord-01-00-en.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summary</a> of its decision.</p><p>Both Sudan and the Emirates are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, but the U.A.E., when it signed the treaty in 2005, opted out of a key clause that allows countries to sue each other at the International Court of Justice, based in The Hague.</p><p>In March, Sudan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/africa/sudan-genocide-icj-uae.html" title="">asked the court</a> to take up its case, alleging the Emirates had violated the Genocide Convention by arming and funding the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/world/africa/paramilitary-rsf-explainer.html" title="">Rapid Support Forces</a>, a powerful paramilitary group that is fighting the Sudanese military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At the initial hearing last month, Sudan urged the court to impose several preliminary orders requiring the U.A.E. to halt actions that could amount to genocide against the Masalit people in the western Darfur region, and to end any further assistance to the R.S.F.</p><p>The Emirati government <a href="https://www.wam.ae/article/bj3wl1s-uae-labels-sudans-allegations-icj-misleading-pure" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected the claims</a>, saying Sudan had failed to present credible evidence and arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction.</p><p>“Quite simply, today’s decision represents a resounding rejection of the Sudanese Armed Forces’ attempt to instrumentalize the Court for its campaign of misinformation and to distract from its own responsibility,” Reem Ketait, a senior official at the Emirati foreign ministry, said in a statement sent to The New York Times after the court’s decision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judges at the International Court of Justice in The Hague on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lex Van Lieshout/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The international court said in its summary that it was “precluded by its statute from taking any position on the merits of the claims made by Sudan” but that it was “deeply concerned about the unfolding human tragedy in Sudan.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Khalid Ali Aleisir, Sudan’s minister of information and the official government spokesman, did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The Rapid Support Forces grew in part out of the notorious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/world/africa/sudan-darfur-janjaweed.html" title="">Janjaweed militias</a>, which in the 2000s helped Sudan brutally suppress a rebellion in Darfur.

The military overthrew him a decade later, but he has not been turned over for prosecution.</p><p>The current <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/sudan-khartoum-military.html" title="">war in Sudan</a> began in April 2023, when the R.S.F. began clashing with Sudan’s military.
