Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, said last week the layoffs would affect primarily administrative functions.</p><p>But according to information gathered by The New York Times from dozens of workers, the reductions were more broadly targeted. Scientists focused on environmental health and asthma, injuries, lead poisoning, smoking and climate change were dismissed.</p><p>Researchers studying blood disorders, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/cdc-layoffs-response.html" title="">violence prevention</a> and access to vaccines were let go. The agency’s center on H.I.V. and sexually transmitted diseases was among the hardest hit, losing about 27 percent of its staff.</p><p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which makes recommendations on how to keep workers safe, was all but dissolved.</p><p>What remains is a hobbled C.D.C., with a smaller global footprint, devoting fewer resources to environmental health, occupational health and disease prevention, public health experts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Instead, the agency will be trained more narrowly on domestic disease outbreaks. Communications will be centralized at H.H.S. in Washington.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The department intends “to ensure a more coordinated and effective response to public health challenges, ultimately benefiting the American taxpayer,” said Emily Hilliard, deputy press secretary at the department.</p><p>“C.D.C. scientists have conducted numerous interviews on a variety of topics and will continue to do so,” she added.</p><p>Critics predicted the move would prevent scientists from speaking frankly about public health.</p><p>“American taxpayers provide the resources for C.D.C.’s specialists and have the right to hear directly from them without interference by politicians,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who led the agency from 2009 to 2017. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The sweeping reductions arrive as the nation confronts an outbreak of measles in Texas and elsewhere, a spreading bird flu epidemic on poultry and dairy farms, and a raft of new questions about public health measures like water fluoridation and school vaccine requirements.</p><p>“What we seem to be seeing is a dismantling rather than a restructuring” of the public health system, said<span>  </span>Dr. Richard Besser, chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the C.D.C. </p><p>On Capitol Hill, the Senate health committee, which recommended confirmation of Mr. Kennedy as secretary, scheduled a hearing on the reorganization of H.H.S., citing the possible impacts on public health.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert F.

About 47,000 Americans are killed by firearms each year, more than half of them suicides.</p><p>But gun violence is a politically fraught topic. Pressure from the National Rifle Association and conservative politicians led to a ban on using federal funds to study gun violence for almost 25 years. Funding was restored in 2019.</p><p>The injury center studied ways to improve gun safety and promoted the use of gun locks, particularly in homes where children live.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“People think of gun violence as a question for law enforcement, but the public health approach has made a big difference,” said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, a former center director.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial for Josselin Corea Escalante, a victim of the Antioch High School shooting earlier this year in Nashville.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Landon Edwards for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Most of the C.D.C.’s Division of Reproductive Health, which studies maternal health, was also shuttered. Whether some or all of its portfolio will be assumed by the new organization created by Mr. Kennedy was not clear.</p><p>Pregnant women and newborns die in the United States at a far higher rate than in other industrialized nations.</p><p>In recent years, the C.D.C. focused on stark racial health disparities that put Black American women at nearly three times the risk of dying of pregnancy complications than white women.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But the Trump administration has been defunding studies of health disparities in racial, ethnic and gender minorities, saying they do not align with the president’s executive orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy said last week that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which makes recommendations for preventing work-related injuries and illnesses, would be absorbed into the health department.</p><p>But on Tuesday, most of its divisions were eliminated, among them offices dedicated to protecting workers in various industries, including mine inspectors.</p><p>Even one of the agency’s most essential functions, infectious disease research, was affected.</p><p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/health/cdc-hiv-prevention-treatment.html" title="">had been weighing moving</a> the H.I.V. prevention division to a different agency within the health department.</p><p>But on Tuesday, teams leading H.I.V. surveillance and research within that division were laid off. It was unclear whether some of those functions would be recreated elsewhere. (A team in the global health center working on preventing mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. was also cut.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Until now, the C.D.C. provided funds to states and territories for responding to and preventing H.I.V. outbreaks. Roughly one in four new diagnoses of H.I.V. is made with agency funds.</p><p>Some H.I.V. experts warned that the move could lead to a rise in H.I.V. infections among Americans.</p><p>“H.I.V. prevention is a lot more than just giving out condoms,” said Dr. John Brooks, who served as chief medical officer for the division of H.I.V. prevention until last year. “It saves lives, averts illness and produces enormous cost savings.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstration to oppose federal H.I.V. funding cuts in front of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Drew Angerer/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Broadly, the reorganization aligns with Mr. Kennedy’s preferred emphasis on research into chronic diseases; federal research has been far too focused on infectious diseases, he has said.</p><p>But the line between them is not always clear,<span>  </span>said Dr. Anne Schuchat, former principal deputy director of the C.D.C. Research that seems disconnected from outbreak response may also be a key for fighting pathogens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“For Zika, we needed experts in birth defects, entomology and vector control, virologists and environmental health experts,” she said. “Emerging threats don’t respect borders of C.D.C. organizational units.”</p><p>The reorganization risks choking the talent pipeline for public health, said Ursula Bauer, former director of the agency’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.</p><p>“Once you decimate an agency like C.D.C., which is full of high-caliber highly trained individuals, building back is going to be incredibly difficult,” she said.</p><p>“It will take two to three times as long to undo the damage as it took to inflict it.”</p><p>The cuts also will take a toll on the agency’s ability to gather and analyze data, which are keys to identifying trends and developing interventions, Dr. Phil Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, said at a news briefing.</p><p>“You take away those systems, and it takes away the ability to see the impact of all these cuts,” he added. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Apoorva Mandavilli reports on science and global health, with a focus on infectious diseases, pandemics and the public health agencies that try to manage them.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/apoorva-mandavilli">More about Apoorva Mandavilli</a></span></p></div><div><p>Roni Caryn Rabin is a Times health reporter focused on maternal and child health, racial and economic disparities in health care, and the influence of money on medicine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin">More about Roni Caryn Rabin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
