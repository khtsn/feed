Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice to lead the nation’s health agencies, formally asked the Food and Drug Administration to revoke the authorization of all Covid vaccines during a deadly phase of the pandemic when thousands of Americans were still dying every week.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/b3ab45ec074c9eff/c583e080-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed a petition with the F.D.A</a>. in May 2021 demanding that officials rescind authorization for the shots and refrain from approving any Covid vaccine in the future.</p><p>Just six months earlier, Mr. Trump had declared the Covid vaccines a <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">miracle</a>. At the time Mr. Kennedy filed the petition, half of American adults were receiving their shots. Schools were reopening and churches were filling.</p><p>Estimates had begun to show that the rapid rollout of Covid vaccines had already <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00619" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saved about 140,000 lives</a> in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The petition was filed on behalf of the nonprofit that Mr. Kennedy founded and led, Children’s Health Defense. It claimed that the risks of the vaccines outweighed the benefits and that the vaccines weren’t necessary because good treatments were available, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which had already <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or#:~:text=June%2015%2C%202020%20Update%3A%20Based,or%20participation%20is%20not%20feasible." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been deemed</a> <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ineffective against</a> the virus.</p><p>The petition received little notice when it was filed. Mr. Kennedy was then on the fringes of the public health establishment, and the agency <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/053d89f1693262a7/eb89d905-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied it within months</a>. Public health experts told about the filing said it was shocking.</p><p>John Moore, a professor of immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, called Mr. Kennedy’s request to the F.D.A. “an appalling error of judgment.” Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, likened having Mr. Kennedy lead the federal health agencies to “putting a flat earther in charge of NASA.”</p><p>Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, described Mr. Kennedy’s effort to halt the use of Covid vaccines as a “massive error.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s transition spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment, but has said recently that he does not want to take vaccines away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asked in November</a> by an NBC reporter about his general opposition to Covid vaccines — and whether he would have stopped authorization — Mr. Kennedy said he was concerned that the vaccines did not prevent transmission of the virus.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have directly blocked it,” he said. “I would have made sure that we had the best science, and there was no effort to do that at that time.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s early opposition to Covid vaccines has alarmed public health experts, many of whom contend that it should disqualify him from overseeing health agencies with the power to authorize, monitor and allocate funding for millions of vaccines each year.</p><p>They are also concerned about how he might handle a possible bird flu pandemic, which could necessitate a rapid deployment of vaccines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>As Mr. Kennedy prepares for his confirmation hearings before two Senate committees, he and his allies have insisted that he is not anti-vaccine.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A page from a book published in partnership with Mr. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children’s Health Defense, that falsely implied Covid shots were behind a wave of youth deaths.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Godofredo A.

Emergency-use authorization — a preliminary form of approval — for immunizations was unusual. Others argued that a public health emergency dictated a speedier rollout.</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said it would be reasonable to debate whether Covid vaccines should have been subject to additional study.</p><p>But she profoundly disagreed with Mr. Kennedy’s views, saying that “the idea that in early 2021 that you could be saying that people over the age of 65 don’t need Covid vaccines — that’s just nuts.”</p><p>Vaccines have rare side effects, and there have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/health/covid-vaccines-side-effects.html" title="">cases of injury from the Covid shots</a>.

It was “part of a wave of suspicious deaths” following Covid vaccines, he claimed. A doctor who was vaccinated alongside Mr. Aaron and the county medical examiner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/us/hank-aaron-death-covid-vaccine.html" title="">dismissed the claim</a>.</p><p>In May, when Mr. Kennedy petitioned the F.D.A. to “<a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1402334560277442568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1402334560277442568%7Ctwgr%5Ed03afbbd3c23eef1a46d9b12c26db2eabfff8117%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fchildrenshealthdefense.org%2Fdefender%2Fpetition-fda-get-science-right-before-approving-covid-vaccines%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immediately remove</a> Covid vaccines from the market,” he was joined by Dr. Meryl Nass, a member of the Children’s Health Defense scientific advisory board and a physician in Maine.</p><p>Her medical license was initially suspended on an emergency basis in early 2022 for prescribing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine to patients with severe cases of Covid, including one who was intubated, Maine <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/ea116454c97c25b2/3821fcad-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">medical board records show</a>.</p><p>She <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/press-release/chd-science-advisor-dr-meryl-nass-files-complaint-against-maine-board-of-licensure-in-medicine-for-violation-of-free-speech-and-baseless-license-suspension/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later sued</a> the board, claiming that it retaliated against her for exercising her right to free speech. The case is pending.</p><p>In 2022, Mr. Kennedy and others filed a lawsuit against the F.D.A. on behalf of Children’s Health Defense and parents who said they were concerned that their children would be given Covid vaccines without their knowledge or consent.
