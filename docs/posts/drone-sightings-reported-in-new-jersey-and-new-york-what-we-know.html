Now the sightings, which many observers believe to be drones, have spread throughout the region.</p><p>Federal authorities investigating the sightings have provided few answers about what the objects are or their origin, leaving residents unsettled and local leaders frustrated.</p><p>U.S. officials have said that they had been unable to corroborate the reported drone sightings, and suggested that many of the objects might in fact be manned aircraft, such as airplanes or helicopters.</p><p>But assurances from state and federal officials that the sightings do not indicate a threat to residents have done little to allay public concerns. Lawmakers have expressed frustration with the lack of information, and are urging the federal government to share more about its investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By Friday, drone sightings had been reported in several states across the region. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she was investigating the matter with federal law enforcement agencies, as local officials received numerous reports of possible drones flying overhead.</p><p>The governor, however, assured the public that there was nothing to fear. “At this time, there’s no evidence that these drones pose a public safety or national security threat,” Ms. Hochul said in a <a href="https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1867625657892843948" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement on social media</a>.</p><p>That evening, however, President-elect Donald J. Trump also weighed in, suggesting that the government was concealing information about the sightings. Otherwise, they should be shot down, he added.</p><p>Here’s what to know about the flying objects:</p><h2 id="link-5156d781">What are they?</h2><p>Pictures and videos of the purported drones show bright objects illuminated against a dark night sky. Some move while others appear to hover in place. Residents and law enforcement officers who have observed the objects say that their lights sometimes go out suddenly, enveloping them in darkness.</p><p>Facebook groups and Reddit threads dedicated to the sightings have accumulated thousands of posts. One Facebook group has tens of thousands of members who share videos and swap theories.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Thursday, the mystery made its way to the White House, where a spokesman for the National Security Council, John Kirby, said at a news conference that federal investigators had been unable to corroborate reports of any unauthorized drones above New Jersey.</p><p>“To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,” Mr. Kirby said.</p><p>Officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. said they had cross-referenced the reported sightings with flight paths related to Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty Airports, and concluded that many of the observed objects were actually planes taking off or landing.</p><p>At a <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3998124/deputy-pentagon-press-secretary-sabrina-singh-holds-a-press-briefing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press briefing on Wednesday</a>, Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, said that the reported objects were not drones operated by the U.S. military and that officials did not believe they were “coming from a foreign entity or adversary.”</p><p>Local officials and residents have expressed their frustration with federal authorities and the little information they’ve provided publicly so far.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Representative Chris Smith, Republican of New Jersey, said in a statement on Friday that the White House’s attitude toward the sightings had been “dismissive.”</p><p>“The Biden administration has an obligation to the American people to figure out and tell us what is going on immediately,” Mr. Smith added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An image from a video taken in Flanders, N.J., on Dec. 3.

Days later, reports of the sightings began pouring into the New Jersey State Police, according <a href="https://x.com/GovMurphy/status/1867606764755054686" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to a letter</a> with Thursday’s date that the state’s governor, Philip D. Murphy, sent to President Biden and posted on social media.</p><p>The initial sightings were clustered in a few counties in northern New Jersey, but the phenomenon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/nyregion/new-jersey-drones.html" title="">quickly spread across the state</a>, including to coastal areas in the south and to the Philadelphia suburbs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In early December, drone sightings were also reported in parts of New York City, first along Staten Island’s west shore, then in southern Brooklyn near the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. On Thursday, sightings were reported <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/12/unidentified-drones-spotted-flying-at-locations-across-nyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the Bronx</a> and <a href="https://x.com/AriesNYCEM/status/1867369067797262690" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">near LaGuardia Airport in Queens</a>.</p><p>The next evening, Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/1867735981182660700" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that he was “aware of concerns” about the sightings and that city officials were investigating them with federal and state agencies.</p><p>Residents in parts of <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/2024/12/13/rockland-county-ny-ed-day-drone-sightings/76959131007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upstate New York</a> have also reported mysterious sightings at night. On Friday evening, reports of drone activity near New York Stewart International Airport in New Windsor caused the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to shut down runways there for about an hour, Lenis Valens, an authority spokeswoman, said.</p><p>This was the first time any runways at the airports operated by the Port Authority had been closed because of drone activity, Ms. Valens said.</p><p>Other sightings have been reported in <a href="https://www.ctinsider.com/connecticut/article/connecticut-mysterious-drone-sightings-19978101.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Connecticut</a>, <a href="https://6abc.com/post/large-drones-spotted-philadelphia-area-fbi-investigates-mysterious-drone-sightings-new-jersey/15630194/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a> and Maryland, where Larry Hogan, the state’s former governor, <a href="https://x.com/GovLarryHogan/status/1867608947525386534" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that he had seen “what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky” above his home in Davidsonville, Md.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-9885045">How are the sightings being investigated?</h2><p>Mr. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said on Thursday that federal authorities had conducted a “thorough analysis” of pictures and videos and were using “very sophisticated electronic detection technologies” to try to determine what the objects were.</p><p>The F.B.I. has been investigating the sightings since late November, and its Newark field office has urged residents to report relevant information to the agency’s tip line. Since the line was opened on Dec. 3, the bureau has received approximately 5,000 tips, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/us/politics/drones-northeast-new-jersey.html" title="">according to an F.B.I. official</a> who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity on Saturday because the official was not authorized to speak publicly. Of those, the official said, less than 100 have been deemed credible enough to warrant additional inquiry.</p><p>On Thursday night, Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey accompanied local law enforcement officers who were looking into sightings near the Round Valley Reservoir in Hunterdon County. In a <a href="https://x.com/AndyKimNJ/status/1867582643346571730" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">series of social media posts</a>, Mr. Kim said he saw several objects in the sky that did not appear on flight tracking software.</p><p>However, on Saturday, Mr. Kim said in <a href="https://x.com/AndyKimNJ/status/1868034879931433387" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">additional social media posts</a> that he had “concluded that most of the possible drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes.” After his excursion with the officers, he said, he had spoken with pilots and consulted a more detailed flight tracking system that showed that he had been nearer to flight paths than he had thought.</p><h2 id="link-637e7577">What happens next?</h2><p>Lawmakers in New York and New Jersey have called on the federal government to provide more information about the purported drones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In his letter to President Biden, Governor Murphy thanked the White House for looking into the issue, but added that it had “become apparent that more resources are needed to fully understand what is behind this activity.”</p><p>Mr. Kirby acknowledged at the Thursday news conference that the spate of reports and public concern about the sightings underscored the importance of having systems to detect and deter drones. Such tools should be made available to state and local law enforcement officials, he said.</p><p>Josh Gottheimer, a Democratic congressman representing parts of northern New Jersey, announced on Tuesday that he would introduce legislation to expand federal grants to help make radar systems available to local law enforcement.</p><p>“This technology will equip our law enforcement, who are the best in the world, with the resources they need to identify how many drones there are, where they’re coming from and where they’re going,” Mr. Gottheimer said in a statement.</p><p>Patrick McGeehan<!-- --> and <!-- -->Hurubie Meko<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>22</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Drone Sightings Are Reported Beyond New Jersey, and a Mystery Grows<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Criminal to Power Broker: </strong>John Chan was a Chinatown gangster before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/chan-china-nyc-influence.html">remaking himself into a powerful force in New York politics</a> — one closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Slowdown in Enforcement: </strong>For eight months, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/nyregion/new-jersey-state-police-slowdown.html">traffic enforcement on New Jersey’s highways plummeted</a>.
