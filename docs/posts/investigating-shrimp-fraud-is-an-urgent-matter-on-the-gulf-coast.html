Domestic shrimpers are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-tariffs-fishing-shrimp.html" title="">embracing a recent slate of tariffs</a> enacted by President Trump as a last-ditch chance to reverse the imbalance.</p><p>“Restaurants are making additional margin because they’re pretending to sell the Gulf product,” Mr. Williams said. “Shrimpers are not getting their fair share, and customers are not getting what they paid for.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>SEAD developed its <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9868375/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">peer-reviewed</a> test in collaboration with <a href="https://annescollege.fsu.edu/faculty-staff/dr-prashant-singh" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prashant Singh</a>, a food safety microbiologist at Florida State University. Dr. Singh said the process was designed to be simple, effective, portable and affordable; the equipment includes a centrifuge and heating device, each roughly the size of a toaster. Mr. Williams described it “as a very sophisticated version of a pregnancy test.”</p><p>SEAD’s mission began in earnest when Mr. Williams and his colleagues tested the shrimp served at two Gulf Coast festivals last September and October. Four out of the five vendors tested at the <a href="https://www.shrimpandpetroleum.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Louisiana Shrimp and Petroleum Festival</a>, held in Morgan City over Labor Day weekend, were serving <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/09/30/testing-finds-mostly-foreign-shrimp-at-louisiana-shrimp-petroleum-festival/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imported shrimp</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Prashant Singh (right), a microbiologist at Florida State University, helped develop the genetic test with SEAD Consulting, Mr. Williams’ company.

(Vendors at his festival passed SEAD’s authenticity tests “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L1_Tl5mcepzYVPKfpZt3LCDwe6KexLoS/edit?tab=t.0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with flying colors</a>,” according to a company release.)</p><p>“The industry really needs someone like Dave to stand up for them,” Mr. Honn said. “Even a change of five or 10 percent in the market can make a huge difference.”</p><p>In September, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/09/mind-your-net-impression-when-seafood-not-wild-fresh-caught-or-local" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published guidance</a> aimed at restaurants that bend “the rules by using pictures, symbols, or other things to make people believe something about what they are selling without actually saying the words. That’s an implied claim. If it’s not true, it’s just as illegal as an outright lie.”</p><p>Alvaro M. Bedoya, who stepped down as F.T.C. commissioner last month, cited that guidance in an <a href="https://shrimpalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bedoya-Oct-2-Letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">October letter</a> sent to the country’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/us-seafood-restaurants-warned-over-false-claims-locally-caught-fare-ftc-2024-10-02/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10 top-grossing</a> seafood restaurants, including Red Lobster, Long John Silver’s and Legal Sea Foods. “I will not hesitate to request a law enforcement investigation if I am presented with credible evidence of a law violation,” Mr. Bedoya wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Williams, a tough-talking Briton who lives in Houston, conveys a visceral connection to the victims of seafood fraud.

If you don’t have a speed gun or a radar,” he said, “there is no enforcement.”</p><p>SEAD started testing shrimp in randomly selected restaurants across the South late last year, with funding from the <a href="https://shrimpalliance.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Southern Shrimp Alliance</a>, which represents the shrimping industry across eight states.</p><p>Only eight of the 44 restaurants <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Smf60WiwV_FnywzyG_L-b9KanECSwEP/edit?tab=t.0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tested</a> on the Mississippi Gulf Coast were found to be serving local shrimp. This reporter visited five of the restaurants SEAD’s team tested, just before the results were released in early December. All of the restaurants contained decorations that implied local seafood was being served. None of their menus were in full compliance with the F.T.C.’s standards.</p><p>Menus at three of the restaurants identified dishes containing Royal Red shrimp, a species found in deep water that generally commands a higher price because of its superior quality. “They’re sweeter, a little like lobster,” said the server at one of the restaurants, in Gulfport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The staff at that restaurant and the other two conceded that the “Royal Reds” on their menus were actually a different species from Argentina. The Argentine shrimp are much cheaper, said Jeremy Zirlott, a fifth-generation shrimper based in Bayou Le Batre, Ala., who has been fishing Royal Reds for 20 years.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dana Honn, a New Orleans restaurateur and advocate for sustainable sourcing, works in the kitchen of his restaurant, Nikkei Izakaya.

The Louisiana Department of Health recorded 4,461 violations of the law through 2024. But the agency, which is responsible for the law’s enforcement, issued no fines. The law <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/06/21/health-inspectors-issued-2600-violations-of-louisianas-imported-shrimp-law/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">didn’t include</a> provisions for penalties.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Louisiana’s lawmakers passed a law with tougher enforcement measures that went into effect on January 1. The health department has since recorded 415 violations, and issued 136 $500 fines through April 11.</p><p>The Louisiana Restaurant Association <a href="https://www.lra.org/2024/12/03/louisianas-new-seafood-labeling-law-what-restaurants-need-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">instructs restaurants</a> serving imported crawfish or shrimp to inform customers, on its menu or on signs, “Some items served at this establishment may contain imported crawfish or shrimp. Ask for more information.” The association does not mention other provisions of the law that require more specific language, including the origin of the crawfish or shrimp.</p><p>Mr. Williams accused the restaurant association of attempting to “dilute the power of the law.”</p><p>“The guidance we provide to our members was issued by the Louisiana Department of Health and remains consistent,” a spokeswoman for the L.R.A. wrote in an email. The health department did not respond to The Times’s questions about how its inspectors interpreted the labeling law.</p><p>Mr. Williams said the comparatively low fraud rates in Baton Rouge (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPeV-LrfKVFV5Sx-6vUBcHj7s9QnT62x/edit?tab=t.0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30 percent</a>), New Orleans (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12yXJ6p9MlX9d9dhwsEZpzPWAqNwtBEtD/edit?tab=t.0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13 percent)</a> and Lafayette (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDdLMCIBrUZgSDN3KkFEBW8IlBhypuoY/edit?tab=t.0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">33 percent</a>) is evidence that Louisiana’s laws, flawed as they’ve been, are having an effect.</p><p>Paige Morrison, director of the <a href="https://usshrimpers.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Shrimpers Coalition</a>, said imported shrimp has so affected prices that her husband, Stevie, had to take a job as a pipe fitter after decades as a commercial shrimper in Georgia.
