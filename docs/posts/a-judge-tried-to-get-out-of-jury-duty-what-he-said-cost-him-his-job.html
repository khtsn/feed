But in December he resigned after a disciplinary panel found that he had tried to get out of grand jury duty by introducing himself as a town justice and saying he could not be impartial based on his opinion of those who appeared in his court.</p><p>“I know they are guilty,” Mr. Snyder said in arguing to be excused, according to a court transcript. Otherwise, he explained, “they would not be in front of me.” (The judge dismissed him and notified the disciplinary panel.)</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Richard Snyder resigned as town justice in Petersburgh, N.Y., after his attempt to get out of grand jury service went awry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cindy Schultz/The Albany Times Union, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The remarks, which were made in October 2023 and led to a formal complaint, were a window into the world of New York’s <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/townandvillage/introduction.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of village and town courts</a>, where traffic tickets and petty crimes are adjudicated by people who are not always steeped in legal basics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“There is no place on the bench for someone who so deeply misunderstands the role of a judge and the administration of justice,” Robert Tembeckjian, the administrator of the disciplinary panel, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Snyder, 68, did not respond to a phone message seeking comment. He earned around $6,000 a year to hear cases on the second and fourth Tuesday each month. His term was scheduled to end this year on Dec. 31. He represented himself before the commission and had no previous disciplinary history with it, Mr. Tembeckjian said.</p><p>New York is among a number of states that allow so-called lay justices like Mr. Snyder to decide minor cases under a system that dates to America’s colonial era, when lawyers were not as ubiquitous as they are today. In 2019, according to the judicial commission, <a href="https://cjc.ny.gov/Policy.Statements/town_&amp;_village_courts.html#:~:text=Town%20and%20village%20court%20justices%20are%20the%20only%20judges%20in,have%20gone%20to%20law%20school." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only about 700</a> of New York’s roughly 1,830 town and village judges had attended law school.</p><p>Before running for town justice, Mr. Snyder was a member of the Town Board in Petersburgh, a community with just under 1,400 residents near the Vermont and Massachusetts borders about 30 miles east of Albany. He has lived in the town his whole life and is a longtime volunteer firefighter there. He graduated from high school and did not attend college.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Everybody in town likes me,” he said during a hearing before the judicial commission last July. “And I have never lost election in town.”</p><p>Mr. Snyder’s résumé includes 34 years at a company in Bennington, Vt., where he worked in quality control on carbon-fiber tables used in X-ray machines. Before that, he worked at a sawmill and a grocery store. He retired in 2016 to help take care of his grandchildren, and now spends most of his time doing that.</p><p>The details of his background emerged at the commission hearing, where he sought to clarify the remarks he had made in trying to get out of grand jury service.</p><p>It did not go well, according to a transcript.</p><p>Mr. Snyder insisted several times that he understood that all people were innocent until proved guilty. But he also made comments that indicated an imperfect grasp of the concept and reiterated the belief that had gotten him into trouble in the first place.</p><p>“I know they’re guilty because they did something wrong,” he said at one point. “That’s how they got a ticket.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The referee leading the hearing also asked if he understood what a grand jury did.</p><p>“Not really,” Mr. Snyder answered. He said he had never presided over a trial but had taken part in annual training as required and had passed every test.</p><p>“In my court, I treat everybody the same, equal, fair, honest,” he said. “I try to work with people, try to help them out. I take pride in my job.”</p><p>He acknowledged that the primary reason he did not want to take part in the six-week grand jury term was because it would interfere with his taking care of his grandson and chores like letting his daughter’s dog out. He said a deputy sheriff with whom he went bowling had told him a person in his role would never be picked.</p><p>Heinz Noeding, the Petersburgh town supervisor, said in an interview that Mr. Snyder had informed him in December that he would be resigning at the end of the month for personal reasons and that he had only learned of the disciplinary action when the commission announced it this week and news outlets reported it.</p><p>A “real humdinger,” Mr. Noeding said.</p><p>He will now interview potential replacements to complete the remainder of Mr. Snyder’s term. Would he ask candidates their views on what it means for a judge to be impartial?</p><p>Mr. Noeding said he had not considered it before, “but it’s probably a reasonable question.”</p><p>Susan C.
