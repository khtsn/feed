Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who supports Vice President Kamala Harris in her presidential bid. The speaker noted that no Republicans were invited.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Mr. Johnson wrote in the letter on Wednesday.</p><p>The same day, James Comer, a Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, announced that he had <a href="https://x.com/GOPoversight/status/1838979281365688518" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched an investigation into the visit</a>, saying it was a partisan event paid for with taxpayer funds.</p><p>Ukraine had not responded to Mr. Johnson’s demands about its ambassador as of Thursday morning.</p><p>The complaints are likely to complicate Mr. Zelensky’s primary objective this week: to push Washington to increase its financial and military aid to Kyiv, as part of his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/europe/zelensky-victory-plan-ukraine-russia-putin.html" title="">“victory plan” to force Russia to the negotiating table</a>. The Ukrainian leader will hold several meetings in Congress on Thursday and is also expected to meet with President Biden at the White House.</p><p>The Ukrainian authorities have long tried to remain neutral in the American presidential campaign, although they have built bridges in both camps to advance their interests. Republicans have been skeptical about providing support to Ukraine, and Donald J. Trump’s vice-presidential choice, JD Vance, has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/world/europe/ukraine-jd-vance.html" title="">deeply critical of previous United States aid packages to Kyiv</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at a meeting with other world leaders in New York on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Still, relations with the Republican camp have deteriorated in recent weeks as the U.S. election campaign picked up pace, with Mr. Trump increasingly denouncing American aid to Ukraine while touting a plan, for which he has offered no details, to quickly broker a peace deal.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> published on Sunday with The New Yorker, Mr. Zelensky questioned that plan, which many in Kyiv fear would leave Russia in control of vast swathes of Ukrainian territory.
