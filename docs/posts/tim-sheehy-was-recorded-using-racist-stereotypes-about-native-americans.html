The state has seven reservations and 12 tribes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Native Americans say that they have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/us/politics/native-americans-biden.html" title="">long been forgotten in political discussions</a> and that basic needs on reservations, including water, electricity and health care, have been ignored by leaders of both major political parties.</p><p>In Montana, some Native Americans said they were appalled but not surprised by Mr. Sheehy’s comments, first reported by The Char-Koosta News, which covers the Flathead Indian reservation in the northwestern part of the state.</p><p>Calvin Lime, who lives on the Blackfeet reservation in northern Montana, said the remarks were a “slap in the face,” and especially unfortunate because the Crow Tribe was one of the <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/crow-tribal-chairman-endorses-trump-campaign" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most outspokenly pro-Trump tribes</a>. (Mr. Sheehy received the endorsement of former President Donald J. Trump in the Republican primary.)</p><p>“For them to bring him there, work with him, they’re happy, they’re promoting him, but behind closed doors they’re the drunken Indian,” Mr. Lime said. “Behind closed doors, you’re actually getting looked at as a lesser-than.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Sheehy’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Senator Jon Tester, the Democratic incumbent locked in a tight race with Mr. Sheehy, declined to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-6"><figure><figcaption><div><h3>At a rodeo fund-raiser</h3><p><span>Mr. Sheehy said people on a Crow reservation would throw beer cans at him.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Native Americans in Montana have been a key voting bloc for Mr. Tester, who is in his third term, but local Native American leaders say that Democrats cannot take their votes for granted. Some suggested that Montana Republicans like Representative Ryan Zinke had made progress in improving the perception of Republicans among the state’s tribes, but Mr. Sheehy’s comments may have jeopardized that, said Alexandra Lin, a former member of the Montana Democratic Party who is Indigenous.</p><p>“Representative Zinke and Senator Daines have begun to understand these really important demographic groups and have been investing in them,” Ms. Lin said, referring to Steve Daines, the state’s Republican senator, “and it’s surprising that Sheehy is not doing this.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kellen Browning is a Times reporter covering the 2024 election, with a focus on the swing states of Nevada and Arizona.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kellen-browning">More about Kellen Browning</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
