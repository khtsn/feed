The legislation, which passed the House with bipartisan support earlier this week, appears to be on a smooth path to garnering the presidential signature of Donald J. Trump when he takes office this month.</p><p>The vote reflected a major shift to the right among Democrats on immigration after their party’s considerable electoral losses in November against Republicans, who campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal border crossings and carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The measure is named for Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by a migrant who crossed into the United States illegally from Venezuela and who had previously been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/us/uga-student-death-timeline.html" title="">arrested for shoplifting</a>, but had not been detained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Republicans queued it up as the first of several border bills they hope to revive and enact when they secure their governing trifecta with Mr. Trump’s inauguration. A similar measure died in the Democrat-led Senate last year, alongside other bills to increase deportations, hold asylum seekers outside of the United States and strip federal funding from cities that restrict their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agencies.</p><p>But on Thursday, some Democrats expressed enthusiasm for the bill.</p><p>“Not only am I voting yes on the Laken Riley Act, I’m cosponsoring the bill,” Senator Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, said on social media, adding: “We must give law enforcement the means to take action to prevent tragedies like what occurred to Laken Riley.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
