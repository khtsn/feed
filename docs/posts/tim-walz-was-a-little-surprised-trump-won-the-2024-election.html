Tim Walz of Minnesota said this week that he was “a little surprised” that he and Vice President Kamala Harris lost the presidential election to Donald J. Trump because he had believed the country was ready for the Democratic ticket’s “positive message.”</p><p>Sitting on Thursday for his first interviews since the election, Mr. Walz told Minneapolis television stations that he had believed Democrats had the advantage in the election — which Mr. Trump won by capturing all seven battleground states and becoming the first Republican to carry the national popular vote in 20 years.</p><p>“It felt like at the rallies, at the things I was going to, the shops I was going in, that the momentum was going our way, and it obviously wasn’t at the end,” <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/1-on-1-with-walz-the-past-present-and-his-political-future/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Walz told KSTP-TV</a>. “So yeah, I was a little surprised. I thought we had a positive message, and I thought the country was ready for that.”</p><p>Mr. Walz’s admission that he was surprised by Ms. Harris’s defeat was at odds with a more dour assessment of the campaign’s chances by its senior leaders, who appeared late last month on a friendly podcast, “Pod Save America.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Jen O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chair, and David Plouffe, a senior adviser, each said during <a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/exclusive-the-harris-campaign-on-what-went-wrong/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an appearance on the podcast</a> that they had not thought Ms. Harris would win heading into Election Day.</p><p>“The political atmosphere, the desire for change, all those fundamentals that you’ve spent a lot of time talking about really presented huge challenges for us,” Mr. Plouffe said.</p><p>Mr. Walz’s interviews with Minnesota television stations came on the eve of a gathering of Democratic governors in Beverly Hills, Calif., where the state leaders are expected to discuss why their party fell short and what posture to adopt as Mr. Trump returns to the White House.</p><p>In Minnesota, Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/state-legislatures-governors-supermajority.html" title="">lost their total control of state government</a>, which had allowed Mr. Walz to sign a raft of progressive legislation that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/tim-walz-minnesota-administration.html" title="">helped power his rise in national politics</a> over the last two years. He told the local television reporters that he had spent the weeks since the election calling and meeting with Republican legislative leaders in his state to prepare for the upcoming legislative session.</p><p>In an interview <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/tim-walz-wcco-interview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with WCCO-TV</a>, Mr. Walz expressed surprise that Mr. Trump had won over middle-class voters who Democrats had expected would vote for them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“To have Donald Trump seen as a champion of the middle class, I fully don’t see how that would happen, but I recognize that’s where people voted,” Mr. Walz said. “I think we have to both decide, is the message the right one?”</p><p>And he engaged in a bit of revisionist history in <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/gov-walz-reflects-losing-campaign-potential-political-future" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview with KMSP-TV</a>, the local Fox affiliate, saying that he had not aimed to become the vice-presidential nominee — a statement that ran counter to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/us/politics/tim-walz-kamala-harris-2024.html" title="">nearly two years of meticulous planning</a> by him and his aides to raise his profile just in case an opening emerged on a national ticket.</p><p>“I didn’t try to get that job,” Mr. Walz said when asked if Ms. Harris had erred by choosing him. “I am proud of what I did. I think we worked hard. I think we made an impact. But, you know, that’s fair. But that’s a decision the vice president would have to say. It was not my choice to make.”</p><p>In the interviews, Mr. Walz declined to identify specific things that he and Ms. Harris could have done better to win.</p><p>“Were there things you could have done differently? Since we lost, the answer is obviously yes,” he told KSTP-TV. “On this one, I did the best I could.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Walz said he had spent the weeks since Election Day readjusting to his life in state government and reacquainting himself with legislative leaders — including the newly empowered Republicans — with whom he will have to work in the coming year. He said that he had not yet decided whether to seek re-election to a third term in 2026, and that he was not interested in running for Senate should a seat open up in Minnesota.</p><p>In the KSTP-TV interview, Mr. Walz also recounted one of the high points of his time on the national ticket — when Ms. Harris introduced him as her running mate at an August rally in Philadelphia.</p><p>“She turns to me,” Mr. Walz said, “and she says, ‘Well, let’s not screw this up.’”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
