A contractor there knocked off work and decided to wait out rush hour traffic. He picked up some takeout from Wawa, parked outside a nearby wildlife preserve and settled in to watch an episode of Joe Rogan’s podcast on his phone. Then he saw a flash in the side mirror.</p><p>A light rising straight up from the tree line and toward the arsenal. He started recording. Could it have been a plane?</p><p>Or was it a drone?</p><p>And so began what seems to be the origin story of the ongoing drone saga. The contractor called in his sighting to his superiors on Nov. 13, and others followed quickly, first throughout the county, then the rest of New Jersey, then into neighboring states.</p><p>Countless people have reported mysterious hovering objects dotting the night skies and posted blurred images — a white light, a black background — on social media.

Our own government? Kids? Visitors from space?</p><p>The story grew to consume police departments, sheriffs, the F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security, a former reality TV star with a supposed inside line to NASA, mayors, governors, the White House and the president-elect.</p><p>But now it appears increasingly likely that if there were any drones at all, it was very few, and that most of the drones people did see — stay with this — were up there looking for the drones people thought they were seeing.</p><p>Mounting evidence, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/video/new-jersey-drones-planes-videos.html" title="">and lack thereof</a>, suggests that perhaps the whole craze has been a sort of communal fever dream fueled by crowd mentality, confirmation bias and a general distrust in all things official.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>This explanation has been widely rejected by those sharing their personal drone experiences, leaving them feeling belittled and gaslit and creating the kind of hothouse where conspiracy theories take root, grow and thrive.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A family that reported seeing multiple drones walks along the beach in Seaside Heights, N.J., at night." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/22/multimedia/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht/00drone-crazy-2-03-jmht-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e320f493-62b4-5249-b599-553745f1aba4" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As New Jersey residents searched for drones, the federal government was widely seen as being slow to react and confusing in its messaging, which was essentially, “Don’t panic, but be vigilant.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-258d4331">‘Out in the ocean’</h2><p>Five days after the arsenal sighting, on Nov. 18, multiple drones were reported, there and elsewhere in surrounding Morris County. A Facebook page called Live Storm Chasers with 1.3 million followers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LiveStormChaser/posts/pfbid0tUcUo8maxieDjFVukyUho8c3M49UVuhqH98tftojnwLiFFzqw9tkXsCEaZRCHXyDl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a five-drone sighting</a>.</p><p>The Morris County Prosecutors Office issued a statement from sheriffs, police chiefs and emergency officials that simultaneously acknowledged and downplayed the sightings and urged people to “be mindful that what they read online may not be accurate.”</p><p>Still, a day later, the F.B.I. quietly opened its own investigation into the drones. The agency would later announce a drone hotline and receive some 5,000 tips.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And the Federal Aviation Administration posted temporary flight restrictions prohibiting drone flights over the arsenal and, shortly after, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.</p><p>The owner of that club would weigh in soon enough.</p><p>November turned to December, and without any new, proven evidence or data to frame what was happening, the story exploded. A lack of facts became pure oxygen on social media and, on its heels, mainstream media. Even people’s Ring doorbells, equipped to alert users with messages from other Ring users, began to ping out drone sightings.</p><p>Jessica Fiorentino, 33, a mother of two young children in Toms River, had heard about drones, but when she went to the beach one night she couldn’t believe what she saw.</p><p>“All the way out in the ocean, drones,” she said on Friday in an interview. “Some would stay above the ocean, and some would come onto the land.” She alerted her followers on TikTok, normally filled with mom posts, and kept going out, every night, sometimes to other beaches, always posting videos.</p><p>“They are very low in Seaside Heights right now,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessicacapo_/video/7448425427707776299" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said in a video on a recent December night</a>, pointing out two lights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Part of me is starting to maybe think that red drone is someone’s drone, like someone here, putting it up, like police,” she reported. “And the one above it is the unidentified drone.” The video was viewed more than 393,000 times.</p><p>The federal government was widely seen as being slow to react and confusing in its messaging, which was essentially, “Don’t panic, but be vigilant.”</p><p>Then came Sunday, Dec. 8, at Island Beach State Park, a narrow stripe of coastline in southern New Jersey. A State Park Police officer contacted the local Ocean County Sheriff’s office with a frightening report right out of a summer blockbuster.</p><p>“Fifty drones were coming from the ocean toward the mainland,” the sheriff, Michael Mastronardy, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6366082641112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Fox News</a>. He rushed to the beach and met the officer. “She had legitimate information she provided,” the sheriff said in a recent interview.</p><p>The following night, the sheriff was joined by a Republican congressman, Representative Chris Smith, who wanted a firsthand look.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He said the drones “have so far evaded identification, origin, mission or potential threat to Americans” and criticized the Biden administration for not taking it seriously.</p><p>Senator Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, was frustrated by a lack of information, so he accompanied police officers on Dec. 12 to three sites that had been flooded with drone calls.</p><p>“They were kind of pointing out things that were flying,” he said. “Some, they were like, ‘That’s a drone.’ These are police officers. They’ve been out there for weeks now.”</p><p>He took videos and showed them to aviation experts, who convinced him that the objects were actually manned aircraft.</p><p>“It kind of highlighted to me: This is the information that people need,” he said.</p><p>Other lawmakers have suggested that the drones should be shot out of the sky. Some people may have tried to heed that call, in a way. Plane and helicopter pilots reported dozens of incidents of lasers being pointed at them over New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in early December. Shining a laser at an aircraft can injure or blind the pilot, and is a federal crime. The F.B.I. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-warns-new-jersey-residents-not-shoot-down-drones-point-lasers-aircraft" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responded and urged people</a> to stop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Fiorentino, her once-MomTok now a full-time DroneTok, was still recording every night, and growing more alarmed at what she was seeing.</p><p>“There’s stuff spraying out of them — this is new to me,” she said in a video on Dec. 15. That video was viewed 485,000 times, and another she posted about spraying got 2.8 million views.</p><p>Jennifer McDonald, 48, taking her 15-minute break outside a Walmart in Pennsville, still hadn’t seen a drone well into December. Her husband kept asking her. Then she went outside and looked up.</p><p>“Hot damn,” she said. She called her husband on FaceTime and they spent her whole break watching the little lights in the sky together.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Ocean County Sheriff’s Office used a drone to monitor any nearby drone activity from a beachside parking lot in Seaside Heights, N.J. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-5e6ceb16">Airplanes and stars</h2><p>By mid-December, after weeks of shrugs, the federal government stepped up its attempt to explain what was going on.
