And there would be further U.S.-backed negotiations on a permanent end to the war.</p><p>That issue has long been the core sticking point in the truce negotiations. Hamas has been willing to free the remaining Israeli and foreign captives in Gaza as part of a broader deal to end the war. Israel has vowed to continue fighting until Hamas lays down its arms and sends it leaders into exile.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff laid the blame on Hamas for the impasse, saying in a statement that its response “only takes us backward.” He said Hamas should accept the U.S. framework as the basis for further intensive negotiations, “which we can begin immediately this coming week.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A Hamas official outside of Gaza had said earlier on Saturday that the group was seeking amendments to the Witkoff proposal around the guarantees for ending the war decisively.</p><p>An Israeli official said Hamas had demanded stronger guarantees that the temporary truce would pave the way for the end of the conflict that began almost 20 months ago. Both the Israeli and the Hamas officials requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p><p>While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says he is willing to reach a temporary cease-fire with Hamas to free hostages, he has ruled out ending the war unless the group meets Israel’s conditions — which the group has rebuffed for the time being. Mr. Netanyahu’s office released a statement on Saturday saying Hamas was “persisting in its refusal.”</p><p>U.S. officials and other mediators have tried to cobble together a new truce since Israel ended the last cease-fire with Hamas in mid-March. But they have struggled to overcome the basic divide in Israel and Hamas’s war aims.</p><p>Hamas said on Saturday that it had submitted an answer to the proposal that aimed to achieve a permanent cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to desperate and hungry Palestinians in Gaza. The wording indicated that the group was seeking more than the current proposal’s guarantee of a temporary pause in hostilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The group said if there was agreement, it would turn over 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 others in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>About 20 living hostages and the bodies of more than 30 others are believed to still be in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israelis at a rally on Wednesday in Tel Aviv marking 600 days since the hostages were taken by Hamas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Leo Correa/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israel ended a two-month cease-fire in mid-March — citing a deadlock in talks on the next steps in the truce. Israeli forces then resumed attacks in Gaza while blockading humanitarian aid from entering the enclave, a ban that Israel relaxed only last week.</p><p>While Israel and Hamas have both dug into their respective bargaining positions, both sides have also faced rising international pressure lately to halt the fighting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Palestinians in Gaza, furious and exhausted after more than a year of war, hunger and bombardment, have held rare protests against Hamas calling for the group to leave the enclave it has ruled since 2007. And since resuming its offensive in March, Israel has killed several senior Hamas leaders in Gaza.</p><p>On Saturday night, the Israeli military announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/middleeast/muhammad-sinwar-hamas-israel.html" title="">that it had killed</a> Muhammad Sinwar, one of Hamas’s top remaining military leaders in Gaza, in airstrikes earlier this month. Mr. Sinwar was the brother of Yahya Sinwar, the former Hamas leader killed by Israeli forces last year and an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel that ignited the war.</p><p>There was no immediate confirmation from Hamas. The Palestinian group has shied away from immediately announcing the deaths of its fighters and commanders during the war.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel’s traditional allies, including the Trump administration, have expressed growing impatience and even anger over the protracted war, the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza that have created a risk of famine, and Israel’s threats to significantly widen the offensive against Hamas.</p><p>Israel went to war after Hamas-led Palestinian militants launched the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 as hostages, mostly civilians. Israel’s devastating assault in Gaza has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
