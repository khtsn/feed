Oleksandr Syrsky, did not specify what kind of measures might be taken, his <a href="https://t.me/osirskiy/981" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alarming statement</a> underscored the deteriorating situation around Pokrovsk, a key rail and road hub for Ukraine’s army.</p><p>In an effort to flank Pokrovsk, Russian troops have pushed south of the city in recent days and are now less than three miles from its outskirts, according to <a href="https://deepstatemap.live/en#10/48.1381414/37.3535156" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">battlefield</a> <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maps</a> based on satellite images and publicly available footage of the fighting. They are also steadily advancing through villages and settlements several dozen miles to the south, threatening to seize the last two Ukrainian strongholds in the southern part of the Donetsk region.</p><p>Moscow is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/11/world/europe/russia-pokrovsk-advance.html" title="">advancing in Donetsk</a> at its fastest pace since 2022, capturing hundreds of square miles each month as it leverages its overwhelming manpower advantage by breaking through Ukrainian positions weakened by troop shortages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Analysts say the Kremlin is racing to secure as many territorial gains as possible before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office next month and starts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">push for peace talks</a> with terms that are likely to be shaped by each side’s status on the battlefield.</p><p>Emil Kastehelmi, a military analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, said that from September to November, Russia had seized more than 600 square miles of Ukrainian territory, roughly twice the size of New York City, almost all of it in the Donetsk region.</p><p>“The rate of advance accelerated every month, despite the Russians suffering heavy losses,” he <a href="https://x.com/emilkastehelmi/status/1863261737358664119" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> this month. He added that Russia could occupy another 200 to 300 square miles of Ukrainian land by the end of the year.</p><p>In recent days, Russia’s army has also intensified its assaults on Ukrainian forces occupying a sliver of land in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html" title="">western Russian region of Kursk</a>. The Ukrainian authorities have suggested that control over Russian territory could be used as a bargaining chip during any peace negotiations, something that the Kremlin would like to avoid.</p><p>It remains unclear what General Syrsky’s “unconventional decisions” will be. But Serhii Kuzan, the chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a nongovernmental research group, said the Ukrainian commander had a record of launching surprise offensives, such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/11/world/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-russian-retreat.html" title="">in the Kharkiv region in 2022</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-offensive.html" title="">in the Kursk region this summer</a>, with varying degrees of success.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Speaking of unconventional decisions, including in the Pokrovsk direction, we recall these two examples and understand that this is Syrsky’s approach,” Mr. Kuzan said.</p><p>In Ukraine, Moscow ratcheted up pressure on Kyiv and its allies last month by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/europe/russia-ballistic-missile-ukraine-war.html" title="">launching an intermediate-range ballistic missile</a> that is capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Although that missile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/europe/russia-oreshnik-ballistic-missile.html" title="">an Oreshnik</a>, was not armed with a nuclear payload, the Kremlin said its decision to launch it at Ukraine was a direct response to Ukraine’s use of U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, against targets in Russia.</p><p>Moscow warned that it would fire more Oreshnik missiles if ATACMS strikes on its territory persisted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anti-tank fortifications known as dragon’s teeth in Pokrovsk last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On Wednesday, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that its forces had thwarted a Ukrainian attack against a Russian air base involving six ATACMS missiles. The claim could not been independently verified.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The same day, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3998124/deputy-pentagon-press-secretary-sabrina-singh-holds-a-press-briefing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said</a> it was possible that Russia could fire another Oreshnik missile “in the coming days.” But she said such missiles were “not going to be a game changer on the battlefield,” because Russia’s stock of them was limited and because they carry a smaller nonnuclear warhead than other missiles Moscow has deployed against Ukraine.</p><p>U.S. officials view the Oreshnik’s use primarily as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missiles.html" title="">an attempt to intimidate Ukraine and its allies</a>.</p><p>On the battlefield, Russia’s recent advances near Pokrovsk align with a strategy long anticipated by military analysts: bypassing the city’s main defensive lines — trenches, bunkers and anti-tank ditches — and instead flanking it from the south through more open terrain.</p><p>Pokrovsk, which had a prewar population of about 60,000, sits on a key road linking several cities that form a defensive arc protecting the part of Donetsk that Ukraine still holds. It is also the last major city in the central part of the Donetsk region under Ukrainian control.</p><p>Combined with the possible fall of Kurakhove and Velyka Novosilka, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-attacks-trump.html" title="">two Ukrainian strongholds under assault further south</a>, the capture of Pokrovsk could pave the way for a complete Russian takeover of the southern half of the Donetsk region. It could also open a path for new attacks on the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region, analysts say.</p><p>Nazar Voloshyn, Ukraine’s military spokesman for the eastern front, said on Ukrainian television on Wednesday that three army positions near Pokrovsk had been lost to Russian forces. He added that Moscow’s troops had entered Shevchenko, the final village on the southern approach to Pokrovsk.</p><p>A Ukrainian military analyst who goes by the pseudonym Tatarigami <a href="https://x.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1866588793102389542" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also said that Russian forces</a> were trying to control the supply routes to Pokrovsk by deploying attack drones over a key road. “This is a serious threat to the resupply process of Pokrovsk, potentially threatening the sustainability of Ukrainian defenses in the area,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Loan to Ukraine:</strong> The Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/20-billion-dollar-loan-ukraine.html">transferred $20 billion to Ukraine</a>, providing an economic lifeline in the form of a loan that will be repaid using interest earned from Russia’s frozen central bank assets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Casualties:</strong> President Volodymyr Zelensky said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/europe/ukrainian-war-dead.html">43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed</a> in the war, a tally that differs from estimates by U.S. officials and military analysts, who have said the number is closer to 70,000.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zelensky Meets With Trump:</strong> The Ukrainian leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/europe/zelensky-trump-macron-notre-dame.html">met with President-elect Donald Trump in Paris</a>, the first face-to-face encounter between the two since Trump won the U.S. presidential election.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
