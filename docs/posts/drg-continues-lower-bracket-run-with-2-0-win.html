		<p>Dragon Ranger Gaming has reached the top-six at Kickoff China following a 2-0 win against Nova Esports. They will next play against FunPlus Phoenix in an elimination match, with the winner of that series potentially facing-off against 2024 Champions, EDward Gaming.</p>

<p>Dragon Ranger Gaming opened the series with a 13-8 win on their pick, Lotus. Nova had a stronger showing on their map, Bind, but DRG ultimately stood out with a 13-7 victory thanks to a strong defense half. </p>

<p>Nova is now eliminated from Kickoff and Masters: Bangkok contention, and will need to wait until Stage 1 to return to the server.</p>
