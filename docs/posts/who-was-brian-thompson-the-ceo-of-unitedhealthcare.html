The division reported $281 billion in revenues last year, providing coverage to millions of Americans through the health plans it sold to individuals, employers and people under government programs like Medicare. The division employed roughly 140,000 people.</p><p>Mr. Thompson’s killing on Wednesday outside a midtown Manhattan hotel as he was walking toward the UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor day sent shock waves through the nation’s vast health care sector. The fatal shooting elicited an outpouring of sympathy from rival insurers, executives, health care providers and others.</p><p>During Mr. Thompson’s tenure as chief executive of UnitedHealthcare, the company’s profits rose, with earnings from operations topping $16 billion in 2023 from $12 billion in 2021. Mr. Thompson received a total compensation package last year of $10.2 million, a combination of $1 million in base pay and cash and stock grants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He oversaw significant growth in one of the company’s key businesses, the sale of private insurance plans under Medicare Advantage, a program mainly for those 65 and older that receives federal funds and now covers roughly half of the 61 million people signing up.</p><p>“He sure as heck had a lot of role in the proliferation of Medicare Advantage,” said Matt Burns, a former United executive who spent several years working for Mr. Thompson, whom colleagues knew as BT.</p><p>Mr. Thompson grew up in Jewell, Iowa, where his father, the late <a href="https://www.fosterfuneralandcremation.com/memorials/dennis-thompson/5135419/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dennis Thompson</a>, worked for decades as a grain elevator operator.<span>  </span>From a modest background, Mr. Thompson had achieved executive status but remained open and approachable, Mr. Burns said. When asked to develop a long-term plan for the company, he solicited input from top executives and then synthesized their views. “That speaks to how inherently sharp he was and how well he knew the business,” Mr. Burns said.</p><p>Steve Nelson, the president of Aetna and a former chief executive at UnitedHealthcare, worked with Mr. Thompson for close to a decade. “He actually was the smartest guy in the room, without being annoying,” Mr. Nelson said of his former colleague, who described his self-deprecating sense of humor. “He would make fun of himself a lot,” Mr. Nelson said, who said Mr. Thompson was an amateur wrestler who liked to challenge colleagues to arm wrestling.</p><p>He was also well-regarded by Wall Street analysts, where he was known for his reassuring descriptions of the company’s outlook.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On a recent call with Wall Street analysts and investors to discuss the company’s financial results, Mr. Thompson provided a confident voice when questioned. When asked about the employer segment, he told one analyst, “I feel really good about not only our performance, but our cost management inside our commercial business.”</p><p>Mr. Thompson had presided over the division as it faced multiple inquiries and has been criticized by congressional lawmakers and federal regulators who accused it of systematically denying authorization for health care procedures and treatments.</p><p>The insurance arm of UnitedHealth Group has also been under federal scrutiny because the parent company was the victim of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/health/cyberattack-healthcare-cash.html" title="">broad cyberattack</a> on its billing and payment system, Change Healthcare. Private information, including health data, from more than 100 million Americans was compromised in the ransomware attack. The parent company paid $22 million in ransom in an effort to stop the hackers.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group has a sprawling dominance over nearly every segment of health care, and it is one of the nation’s largest companies overall, with $372 billion in revenue last year. But its massive size and scope have attracted the attention of the Justice Department, which is looking into whether the company has engaged in any anti-competitive behavior. The company’s proposed acquisition of a major home care company recently resulted in a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and four state attorneys general seeking to block the deal.</p><p>In addition, Bloomberg News reported that several of UnitedHealth Group’s executives sold stock. According to regulatory filings, Mr. Thompson owned about $20 million of shares in the parent company as of late September. In April, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/unitedhealth-unh-executives-sold-stock-before-us-probe-became-public" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that he was one of at least four executives at the company who had sold shares before the Justice Department antitrust investigation was disclosed to the company’s investors — about $15 million worth in Mr. Thompson’s case. The company told Bloomberg at the time that the sales had been approved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After Mr. Thompson joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004, he rose steadily, taking on various finance roles and eventually overseeing the company’s government plans offered to people who qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, the state-federal program for the poor. United’s management of those plans has also been scrutinized by the federal government.</p><p>Those who worked with him during that time said he was responsive to concerns about how to serve the individuals in those programs. “Every interaction with him felt extremely genuine,” said Antonio Ciaccia, a consultant who discussed using pharmacists to help provide better care for people receiving Medicaid. “He was a very good listener.”</p><p>Before he went to work at United, Mr. Thompson spent nearly seven years at PricewaterhouseCoopers, also known as PwC, the large accounting firm. He graduated from the University of Iowa with a bachelor’s degree in business administration with an accounting major in May 1997. </p><p>A number of the insurer’s rivals and analysts said they were shocked by the news of his killing, and praised his management style.</p><p>“It’s a very dark day for all of health care,” said Michael Ha, an analyst at Baird who was at the investor conference on Wednesday. “He was so smart, talented leader, very well-respected, with such a bright future as a health care leader.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Gail Boudreaux, the chief executive of Elevance Health, said that overseeing health care organizations “is marked by dedication, compassion and a profound commitment to improving lives, and Brian embodied these qualities and more.’’</p><p>“I knew him to be a visionary leader who developed innovative ideas to take on some of the nation’s greatest challenges,” said Kim Keck, the chief executive of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents Blue Cross plans. “His death is a great loss for our country and for the health care industry.”</p><p>Mr. Nelson of Aetna said he would not speculate about any motive for Mr. Thompson’s murder, but he noted that insurance executives are sometimes the target of people’s frustrations with the health care system.</p><p>“I’m not going to say that it comes with the territory, because that’s ridiculous,” he said. “Nobody should ever feel their life is threatened for doing their job.”</p><p>In a video sent to UnitedHealth employees, Andrew Witty, the parent company’s chief executive, said: “Brian was a truly extraordinary person who touched the lives of countless people throughout our organization and far beyond. It’s a terrible tragedy.” The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the video message.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In a statement issued on Wednesday, the company said it was working closely with the New York Police Department. “Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him,” the company said.</p><p>Mr. Thompson lived with his family in a suburb of Minneapolis. He is survived by his wife, Paulette R. Thompson, a physical therapist who works for a Minnesota health system, and two children.</p><p>Joe Rennison<!-- -->, Stefanos Chen, Julie Creswell and Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reed Abelson covers the business of health care, focusing on how financial incentives are affecting the delivery of care, from the costs to consumers to the profits to providers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/reed-abelson">More about Reed Abelson</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
