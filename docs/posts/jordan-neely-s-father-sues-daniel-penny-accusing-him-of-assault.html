The lawsuit, which has no bearing on Mr. Penny’s criminal case, seeks unspecified damages for physical assault and battery.</p><p>Mr. Zachery’s lawyer, Donte Mills, declined to comment on the suit.</p><p>Thomas A. Kenniff, one of Mr. Penny’s lawyers, said on Thursday that his team remained “focused on seeing Mr. Penny’s criminal case through to acquittal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We have yet to be served with any civil action, but will respond accordingly in due course,” Mr. Kenniff said.</p><p>Mr. Penny, a former Marine and architecture student, had left class that May afternoon and was on his way to the gym when he got on an uptown F train in Manhattan. There, he encountered Mr. Neely, who had boarded the train and begun yelling, throwing his jacket on the floor and striding through the car, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/nyregion/daniel-penny-trial-subway-chokehold-case.html" title="">according to witnesses</a>.</p><p>Mr. Neely, who had a history of mental illness, approached other riders and screamed that he was hungry, that he wanted to return to jail and that he did not care if he lived or died, they said. Mr. Penny stepped in, according to witnesses, and put Mr. Neely in a chokehold. He then forced him to the floor.</p><p>As the two men struggled, the train stopped at the Broadway-Lafayette Street station, allowing passengers to leave the car. But Mr. Penny did not let go of Mr. Neely, according to video taken by bystanders. Mr. Neely died soon thereafter.</p><p>Mr. Penny was subsequently charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. If the jury in his criminal trial finds Mr. Penny guilty, he could face up to 15 years in prison. There is no minimum sentence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Penny’s lawyers have argued in court that it is impossible to know how much pressure he exerted when he put Mr. Neely in a chokehold, and that it was in fact Mr. Neely’s schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana use and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/nyregion/daniel-penny-defense-jordan-neely.html" title="">sickle cell trait</a> that led to his death.</p><p>Mr. Neely was estranged from his family, including Mr. Zachery, during the latter years of his life. He moved in and out of shelters and hospitals and was on a roster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/13/nyregion/jordan-neely-top-50-mental-illness.html" title="">informally known as the Top 50</a>, a list of homeless New Yorkers in a city of eight million who stand out for the severity of their troubles and their resistance to accepting help.</p><p>Christopher Neely, Mr. Neely’s uncle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/nyregion/subway-choking-jordan-neely-relatives.html" title="">said he would drive around Manhattan</a> looking for his nephew, hoping to offer him food and shelter.</p><p>Throughout the trial, Mr. Zachery has remained a relatively consistent, if quiet, presence. He has often left the courtroom when video footage of Mr. Neely struggling in Mr. Penny’s chokehold has played on a TV screen facing the gallery.</p><p>Mr. Zachery has not offered a statement to the press since the first day of the trial, when he described his son as a “good kid, very humble.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jordan-neely">Jordan Neely</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/danny-penny">Danny Penny</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
