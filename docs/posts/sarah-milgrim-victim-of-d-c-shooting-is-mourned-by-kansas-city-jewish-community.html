She loved horseback riding and caring for animals, once using oven mitts to save a baby bunny. A rabbi who had known her since she was a young girl recalled her as a steadfast member of the Jewish community through high school and then at the University of Kansas. And her supervisor at the Israeli embassy praised her for serving as a liaison to progressive groups “with a natural brilliance and boldness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A gunman killed Ms. Milgrim, 26, and her boyfriend, Yaron Lischinsky, 30, last week as they left an event focused on improving the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Middle East. The suspect claimed that he “did it for Gaza,” according to an F.B.I. affidavit filed in federal court.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A candlelight vigil was held outside the White House in Washington last week for Ms. Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One of the rabbis who participated in Ms. Milgrim’s funeral service called the violence incomprehensible, something that people were not supposed to understand.</p><p>Doug Alpert, the rabbi at the Kol Ami synagogue in Kansas City, Mo., called Ms. Milgrim “a good soul” and “a pursuer of peace.” He spoke of Ms. Milgrim’s “innate sense of goodness” toward people and the environment, saying she believed “our place in the world was not to run roughshod over it, but to be its loving caretaker.”</p><p>Ms. Milgrim grew up in the relatively small Jewish community of Kansas City — about 20,000 people spread across two states. Moments of antisemitism are seared in the community’s memory, including the swastikas that were spray-painted at Ms. Milgrim’s public high school in 2017, when she was a student there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2014, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/us/white-supremacist-convicted-of-killing-3-at-kansas-jewish-centers.html" title="">white supremacist shot and killed three people</a> outside a Jewish center and retirement community in Overland Park. None of the victims were Jewish, but during his trial, the killer, who was convicted of capital murder, said that he had wanted “to kill Jews, not to kill people.”</p><p>Last Wednesday in Washington, Ms. Milgrim and her boyfriend had been looking forward to big plans. On Sunday, they were supposed to fly to Israel, where Mr. Lischinsky had planned to introduce Ms. Milgrim to his family. He was going to propose to her there, said Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the United States.</p><p>Instead, their funerals were held a day apart. Mr. Lischinsky was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/world/middleeast/israel-funeral-dc-shooting.html" title="">buried on Monday</a> 6,000 miles away, near his childhood home in Israel.</p><p>On Tuesday, most entrances to the synagogue in Kansas were blocked by cars or trucks, and a heavy police and security presence stood by.</p><p>Several funeral speakers said Ms. Milgrim wanted peace and described how she had dedicated her life to promoting it, including at the Israeli embassy. Sawsan Hasson, her supervisor, said that although hate had taken her from them, “Somehow, in your passing, you have created connection and meaning.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>While earning a master’s degree at American University, Ms. Milgrim spent time in Israel working for and studying an organization that brings together Israelis and Palestinians in their 20s for seminars to develop technical skills. The group gives them a chance to meet people on the other side of the long-running conflict.</p><p>“If you were really interested in creating solutions to this seemingly endless conflict that separates Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Palestinians, you could’ve asked Sarah,” Rabbi Alpert told the synagogue.</p><p>Speakers pledged to follow her example. “We will carry your torch, Sarah,” Rabbi Kramer said. “We will continue your mission.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Juliet Macur is a national reporter at The Times, based in Washington, D.C., who often writes about America through the lens of sports.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
