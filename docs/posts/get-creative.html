    <h1>Get Creative</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Last May, my father-in-law showed up at my house with a child-size drum set in his trunk. That might make some parents shudder, but I was thrilled. I was a drummer when I was younger, with a set just like this one, and now my 7-year-old son could follow in my footsteps.</p><p>I’ve learned two things in the year since. First, you can’t force your kids to like the things you like; my son has probably played those drums for 15 minutes total. More important, though, I learned that I wasn’t a former drummer. I’m <em>still </em>a drummer. Even though I hadn’t engaged that part of my brain in years, my trips downstairs to do laundry now usually include a few minutes bashing on that little drum set. I’m not making beautiful music — just ask my neighbors — but I’m having a great time. Every little session leaves me feeling energized.</p><p>That spark of creativity is something my colleagues at Well, The Times’s personal health and wellness section, think everyone could use more of. Starting tomorrow, they’ve got a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/well/ready-for-a-mental-reboot-sign-up-for-our-5-day-creativity-challenge.html" title="">five-day challenge that aims to help readers nurture their creative side</a>. I spoke with <strong>Elizabeth Passarella</strong>, the writer behind the project, to learn more.</p><p><strong>After years away from the drums, I’ve been shocked by how good it feels to make music. Why is that?</strong></p><p>What you feel is what many of us feel when we do something creative: giddy and inspired. Whether you do something more traditionally creative, like draw or play music, or riff on a recipe because you were out of an ingredient, it gives you a little boost. And there is plenty of research that links creativity to happiness and better moods.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>Some people reading this are gifted painters and musicians, I’m sure. But others would probably say that they don’t have much artistic talent. What would you say to them?</strong></p><p>You are all creative in some way. There’s a definition of creativity that researchers use: generating something novel that is also useful. That could be the score to a movie. It could also be, as one expert told me, a brilliant solution to keeping your dog out of a certain area of your house. Or making up a weird game to play with your toddler.</p><p><strong>Basically, anybody can be creative at any time.</strong></p><p>Yes. And it might come more naturally to some of us. But it’s a skill you can practice and grow. Several researchers I spoke to emphasized how curiosity — just being open to something new or asking questions — is a hallmark of being creative. We can all nurture that.</p><p><strong>Part of the goal here, I know, is to help people actually get over the hump and </strong><strong><em>do</em></strong><strong> a creative new thing. How does that happen?</strong></p><p>Every day, we give you a short exercise that’s a warm-up for your brain. Kind of like a stretch. And we tell you the aspect of creative thinking that it’s demonstrating, some of which you probably already do but just don’t realize. For example, having constraints when you are problem-solving can improve your solutions. It’s why I write snappier articles when my editors give me word counts (which they always do). On the day we talk about constraints, we’ll ask you to write a poem using only certain words we provide. I love that challenge. You’ll see one of my poems as an example. Be nice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>I’m sure your poetry is just as good as my drumming. Before this project, did you consider yourself a creative person?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. I’m a journalist, I write books and I have no other employable skills. Writing is the only job I’ve ever had, so honestly, learning techniques to get out of a rut and knowing I can grow my own creativity feels like I’ve gained a little job security. (Haha, just kidding. There’s no job security in writing.) But in all seriousness, before reporting this story, I would have said that creativity always alights on you, like a muse. I learned that, no, you can work at it. That makes me excited and hopeful.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-33ffbf21">Middle East</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Tehran.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>The U.S. presented its first formal proposal to Iran for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/us/politics/iran-nuclear.html" title="">elements of a nuclear deal</a>.

In a very candid and wide-ranging conversation, we talked about repairing her relationship with her dad, her love for Dolly Parton and the tumultuous period a decade ago when she left Disney behind to become an adult pop star.</em></p><p><strong>When you look back at that period, 2013, when you were onstage with Robin Thicke and getting a lot of criticism for twerking at the V.M.A.s —</strong></p><p>All you have to say is “2013,” and I know where we’re going.</p><p><strong>Yeah. You were shedding your Disney persona and becoming an adult in the public eye. When you look back at that period, what do you see?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>I see adults not acting like it. I would never look at someone that’s 18, 19, 20, 21 years old and judge them as an adult, because they’re not yet. At one point, there was even a petition. It was like “Millions of Moms against Miley” or something.</p><p><strong>Sinead O’Connor wrote an open letter to you after the “Wrecking Ball” video was released. She wrote: “The music business doesn’t give a [expletive] about you, or any of us. They will prostitute you for all you are worth, and cleverly make you think it’s what you wanted.”</strong></p><p>That feels like her experience being reflected on to me, but that’s not my experience. My experience was not that the music industry didn’t care about me.</p><p><strong>That’s what I was wondering. Looking back, do those words have a different resonance now?</strong></p><p>No, I still don’t feel that way. But I also came from a very different upbringing, where I’ve known fame since the moment that I was born, so I was really well prepared. It’s hard to train yourself to know what to expect, everything that fame can bring, but I already had the handbook, because they did the same thing to my dad, and to Dolly, to everyone around me.</p><p>You know what I think it is? I understand the business I’m in. I’m in the record business. When I sign a contract, they’re buying records that they wish to sell, so I understand that I am setting myself up to become merchandise. I’ve committed to them that I want to not only bring success for myself but also to them. So I understand the music industry. At one point in my life, I look forward to just being an artist, untied, untethered. At some point I’ll get to do that.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Testani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>In this week’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/dining/chicken-taco-recipe-weeknight-dinners.html" title="">Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter</a>, Emily Weinstein suggests making quick and easy chicken tacos, a peppery beef and shishito stir-fry, and cheesy baked gnocchi with spicy tomato sauce.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tom Wright-Piersanti is an editor on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/us-morning-briefing">The Morning</a> newsletter, The Times’s guide to the top news of the day.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
