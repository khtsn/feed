Large crowds are anticipated in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, where police have already closed roads.</p><p>The streets around City Hall in Philadelphia will also be shut down for an event where Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, is slated to speak.</p><p>Organizers in small towns say they are also expecting dozens, if not hundreds, of participants at protests in front of municipal buildings and public schools, with some wearing red to indicate support for public education. In Norman, Okla., and Sauk City, Wis., demonstrators will stand on bridges and display signs for motorists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Trump administration has engaged in efforts to quell dissent in corporate America, the civil service, universities and the media. But in recent weeks, demonstrations opposing Mr. Trump’s agenda, governing style and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-100-days-president-power-law.html" title="">expansion of executive power</a> have increased in size and frequency.</p><p>Town halls have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/republicans-congress-town-halls-trump.html" title="">unruly</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/nyregion/mike-lawler-town-hall-trump.html" title="">combative</a>, pushing many Republican lawmakers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/gop-town-hall.html" title="">avoid facing voters</a> altogether. And collective efforts by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/university-leaders-letter-trump.html" title="">universities</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/unions-cities-nonprofits-sue-block-trump-workforce-cuts-2025-04-29/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nonprofit groups</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/business/economy/government-union-trump-musk.html" title="">unions</a> and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/law-firms-perkins-coie-trump.html" title="">some law firms</a> have slowly started to build momentum against the administration.</p><p>Large groups of people have mobilized across the country, including for the “Hands Off!” protests on April 5, which focused on opposition to Elon Musk, a major political donor to Mr. Trump and unelected billionaire working with the administration, gutting large portions of the federal government.</p><p>Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat who first ran for office in 2018 because of his revulsion to Mr. Trump’s first term, called for a larger outcry during a speech on Sunday in New Hampshire. “It’s time to fight everywhere and all at once,” he said. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katie Benner is a correspondent writing primarily about large institutions that shape American life.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">U.S. Politics: News and Analysis</h2><h3>Here’s a look at the political landscape across America.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Swampbuster Protections Under Threat:</strong> A longtime provision of federal law, which has protected millions of acres of wetland from being farmed, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/swampbuster-wetlands-iowa.html">facing a legal challenge</a> by an emboldened property rights movement.</p></li><li><p><strong>D.N.C.
