After meeting China’s vice premier for economic policy, He Lifeng, Mr. Daines said in an interview that he believed a summit would be held by the end of the year — a slower pace than many in Washington had expected.</p><p>On the Chinese side, Communist Party officials and government advisers said in interviews over the past week that they were taken aback by Mr. Trump’s rapid-fire moves on tariffs, Greenland, Ukraine and other issues. They have been startled by his hostile treatment in public of foreign leaders like President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. As a result, they are cautious about scheduling a summit.</p><p>Tensions between Beijing and Washington could worsen this week, when a new set of Mr. Trump’s tariffs is set to take effect in a potentially broad limit on trade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Chinese officials are reluctant to schedule a summit until the two sides have negotiated details in advance, including a deal between the two countries that would endure for the rest of Mr. Trump’s term. The Trump administration has not yet specified what an acceptable deal might be.</p><p>“The Chinese side believes the Trump administration has not really figured out what is the way to deal with China and make a deal,” Wu Xinbo, the dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said on Friday.</p><p>“The Chinese side would like to wait for a more constructive and sensible signal from the administration,” said Mr. Wu, who was part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-tariffs-china.html" title="">an unofficial delegation</a> of retired senior Chinese officials and academic advisers who met with American officials and experts last month in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shipping containers at Tianjin Port last month.

But it remains unclear whether their governments can make enough progress by then, said the experts, who were not authorized to comment.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a faxed reply to questions about the possible timing of a summit, the spokesperson’s office at China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had “no information to release at this time.”</p><p>Mr. He held a video call on Wednesday with Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative. Mr. He expressed concern about Mr. Trump’s imposition of two rounds of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods so far this year, according to a Chinese statement after the meeting.</p><p>China has already retaliated against Mr. Trump’s initial tariffs on Chinese goods by imposing extra tariffs on imports of American fossil fuels and agricultural products.</p><p>Senator Daines’s trip was only the second congressional visit to China in more than five years. While members of Congress usually travel in groups to foreign countries, no other senators or representatives chose to accompany Mr. Daines to Beijing.</p><p>Beijing has not rewarded the American side for Mr. Daines’s outreach. In an unannounced move on March 16, China, the world’s largest importer of beef, halted practically all imports of American beef. It had previously been buying $1 billion a year of American beef, much of it from Mr. Daines’s state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Beijing granted five-year licenses in March 2020 to several hundred American slaughterhouses to export beef to China. That came after years of intermittent interruptions in shipments because of trade frictions and China’s purported concerns over mad cow disease in the United States, although international animal health experts found the beef to be safe. China’s own beef industry has also long opposed imports.</p><p>The recent expiration of the export licenses has in effect closed the Chinese market, with shipments plummeting to 54 tons in the week after the licenses expired, from about 2,000 tons a week.</p><p>Beijing’s decision not to renew the slaughterhouse licenses put pressure on Mr. Daines.</p><p>“The effects of this decision on U.S. ranchers can hardly be overstated, which is why I raised this issue directly with Vice Premier He Lifeng,” Mr. Daines said, adding that he was “calling on China to reverse this decision.”</p><p>The spokesperson’s office at China’s foreign ministry said that it was “not aware” of the slaughterhouse license dispute.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Keith Bradsher is the Beijing bureau chief for The Times.
