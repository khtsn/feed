It provides infrastructure and financial support for down-ballot candidates in off years before building an operation for a presidential nominee.</p><p>Mr. Martin captured the chairmanship on the strength of his yearslong relationships with party members, whose affection he won by promising to focus more on their concerns than past leaders have.</p><p>In his victory speech, Mr. Martin touched on a theme that Democrats hit throughout the weekend — that Mr. Trump was aligned with his billionaire supporters rather than with the American people.</p><p>“Are we on the side of the robber baron, the ultrawealthy billionaire, the oil and gas polluter, the union buster?” Mr. Martin asked. “Or are we on the side of the American working family, the small-business owner, the farmer, the immigrant and the students?”</p><p>He described the early days of the Trump administration as “what happens when amateur hour meets demolition derby.”</p><p>Mr. Martin defeated seven other candidates, including his top rival, Ben Wikler, the energetic chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Mr. Wikler’s base of support came from the party’s biggest donors and institutional players in Washington, including Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the former House speaker.</p><p>Mr. Martin won comfortably, with 246.5 votes to Mr. Wikler’s 134.5.</p><p>Late Friday, Mr. Wikler disclosed that his financial backers had included the billionaire Reid Hoffman and George Soros’s political action committee, both of which gave him $250,000.</p><p>Mr. Martin inherits a diminished party whose brand has suffered from its losses in 2024. A recent poll from <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3918" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quinnipiac University</a> showed that just 31 percent of voters viewed the Democratic Party favorably, a record low, while 43 percent saw the Republican Party favorably, more than ever before. And in the last four years, during President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s term and the tenure of the previous D.N.C. chairman, Jaime Harrison, Democrats have lost control of the White House, the Senate and the House.</p><p>After his victory, Mr. Martin pledged to conduct and make public a review of why Democrats lost the presidential election, though in an interview he said the party’s examination would not address the question of whether Mr. Biden should have sought re-election.</p><p>“That’s not going to be part of the review,” Mr. Martin said when asked about Mr. Biden’s role in the party’s defeat. “For me, I’m looking at things that will help inform the future, because I can’t change the past.”</p><p>Mr. Martin said that the review — which he said would not be called an “autopsy” because the party was “not dead” — would be led by trusted people outside the party and would encompass the efforts of aligned super PACs and nonprofits.</p><p>“We want all of those at a table so we can actually learn the right lessons from this election,” he said, adding that he hoped to avoid a “circular firing squad.”</p><p>While Mr. Martin portrayed himself as a disrupter who would upend the D.N.C.’s longstanding relationships with Washington consultants, he was in fact the race’s party insider. He founded, and for years has led, the organization of Democratic state chairs, an alternate power center within the party. The group, which has often pushed for more money for state parties, emerged as an annoyance — or worse — to top D.N.C. officials in Washington who were more focused on winning national elections than on local politics.</p><p>Still, Mr. Martin’s connections prevailed.</p><p>“Ken knows that we need to reach out to Americans in every state and every county, no matter how red or how blue, and he will do exactly that as our new chair of the D.N.C.,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m excited to work with him to strengthen our party and win elections.”</p><p>The vote came after a day of in-person jockeying at the same convention center in Oxon Hill, Md., that has traditionally hosted the Conservative Political Action Conference. Mr. Wikler and Mr. Martin both had sponsored hospitality suites, and hosted kickoff drinks and small bites for supporters.</p><p>Mr. Martin will take over a party apparatus with stable finances after its defeat to Mr. Trump last year but without an obvious national leader or a consistent message to voters. When Mr. Trump ascended to the White House eight years ago, angry Democrats marched in the streets by the millions, flooding campaigns and liberal causes with donations meant to push back against the administration.</p><p>That is not the case this time.</p><p>Still, throughout the campaign for party chair, Mr. Martin and Mr. Wikler both insisted that little was wrong with Democrats’ overall message: that they are the party of working people while Mr. Trump and Republicans align with billionaire moguls.</p><p>During a final candidate forum on Thursday in Washington, Mr. Wikler drew rousing applause for defending former Vice President Kamala Harris’s performance as a candidate. Mr. Martin also argued that Democrats did not need to change their message to voters.</p><p>“Anyone saying we need to start over with a new message is wrong,” he said. “We got the right message.”</p><p>Other candidates included former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who entered Saturday in a distant third behind Mr. Martin and Mr. Wikler among D.N.C. members who had publicly declared their support. He received 44 votes.</p><p>Faiz Shakir, who was the campaign manager for Senator Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential bid, made a late entry into the race with an argument that the existing candidates were engaging in small-ball thinking. He won only two votes.</p><p>As is typical for D.N.C. elections, the race also attracted a few gadflies, including Marianne Williamson, the two-time presidential candidate. They were allowed to participate in the party’s online and in-person candidate forums and to deliver speeches to the national committee members who gathered on Saturday at a hotel in the Maryland suburbs of the nation’s capital.</p><p>But by and large, they added little to the party’s discussion about how to proceed. Ms. Williamson ended up endorsing Mr. Martin in her nominating speech on Saturday.</p><p>Much of the race’s sharpest internal divisions focused on the question of the loyalty of the party’s biggest donors. Reid Hoffman and Alexander Soros, billionaires who fund a host of Democratic causes, both backed Mr. Wikler. John Stocks, the chairman of the Democracy Alliance, a network of wealthy dark-money liberal donors, spoke at Mr. Wikler’s rally on the eve of the party’s vote.</p><p>Yet Mr. Martin, in his post-victory interview, said he did not plan to seek to make amends with the donor class that supported his opponent in the contest to lead the party.</p><p>“I don’t have any repair work to do,” Mr. Martin said. “If they want to talk to me, they can come talk to me.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="30" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMDdkMGQ0NWMtMDAwNC01NDM3LWJhODItNzBmNDQ4M2YyNjM5"><div id="07d0d45c-0004-5437-ba82-70f4483f2639" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/dnc-chair-news#07d0d45c-0004-5437-ba82-70f4483f2639"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/reid-j-epstein"><img alt="Reid Epstein" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/reader-center/author-reid-epstein/9e877853d8234217b58e5762253aa771-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/reader-center/author-reid-epstein/9e877853d8234217b58e5762253aa771-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/reader-center/author-reid-epstein/9e877853d8234217b58e5762253aa771-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-01T19:13:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 1, 2025, 2:13 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In his discussion with reporters, Ken Martin would not engage on the question of whether Senate Democrats should vote to confirm President Trump’s cabinet nominees.

And during the Detroit forum, he alluded to another role he might try to play as chairman: attack dog.</p><p>In Minnesota, he said, he saw his job as seeking to define the Republicans, an effort to free up Democratic candidates to “take the high road.”</p><p>“I will throw the punches so they don’t have to, and we will go on the offense against Donald Trump,” he said. “That’s the role that I will play as spokesperson.”</p><p>And, he promised, “I will also be the organizer in chief.”</p><h2 id="link-25cade0b">His win was not about ideology.</h2><p>Sometimes, races for state and national chair positions offer revealing insights about the ideological direction in which a party is heading, or serve as proxy fights in broader clashes between activists and the establishment.</p><p>Not so in this year’s race.</p><p>While Mr. Martin calls himself a “pro-labor progressive” and cites the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/opinion/tim-walz-paul-wellstone.html" title="">populist Mr. Wellstone</a> as <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/ken-martin-dnc-chair-interview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an inspiration</a>, he and Mr. Wikler both promised a “big tent” approach and drew endorsements from both left-leaning and more moderate officials.</p><p>And Mr. Martin has cast himself as a pragmatist focused above all on winning.</p><p>“I’m not here to win the argument,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJhsEKPU-js" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said recently</a> on MSNBC. “I’m here to win elections.”</p><p>The purpose of a political party, he added, is “to build the infrastructure to not only win the upcoming election but to build long-term power.”</p><p>Reid J.

But it is unclear what support Williamson actually had; no D.N.C. member had publicly endorsed her.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Allison Robbert for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div id="" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url=""><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/reid-j-epstein"><img alt="Reid Epstein" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/reader-center/author-reid-epstein/9e877853d8234217b58e5762253aa771-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/reader-center/author-reid-epstein/9e877853d8234217b58e5762253aa771-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/reader-center/author-reid-epstein/9e877853d8234217b58e5762253aa771-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-01T17:03:46.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 1, 2025, 12:03 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Nate Snyder, another candidate who had no demonstrable support, concluded his nomination speech by withdrawing from the race.

But others envision less an overhaul than a wait-and-see approach, hoping to harness what they expect will be a backlash of public opinion against Mr. Trump’s ambitious White House agenda to capture the House of Representatives in 2026.</p><p>The divide does not fall neatly along ideological lines. Some of the most moderate and progressive Democrats alike are aligned in seeking a sharp course correction to reverse the party’s erosion of support, especially among working-class voters.</p><p>“We need deep changes and hard conversations, not nibbling around the margins,” said Representative Pat Ryan, a Democrat who represents a swing district north of New York City and who outperformed the top of the ticket by one of the wider margins in the nation. “At the core, the brand is weakened to the point that, without members running against it in tough districts, we can’t get to a majority, which is structurally untenable.”</p><p>Democrats who share this bleaker outlook see statistical signs of the party’s decline everywhere: Blue states are ceding population to red states. Voter registration figures are mostly headed in the wrong direction. More Americans are identifying with the G.O.P. than with Democrats. And Democrats lost ground last year among core constituencies including lower-income, Latino and younger voters as Mr. Trump swept every battleground state.</p><p>Yet, there are a number of glass-half-full Democrats, too.</p><p>That more upbeat group tends to focus on the narrowness of the G.O.P.’s current 218-to-215-seat advantage in the House, the extraordinary circumstances of the 2024 race — Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt and Democrats switched nominees over the summer — and the fact that political pendulum swings are as common as they are predictable.</p><p>Almost no one is suggesting Democrats should simply stay the course. But the differing diagnoses of the party’s affliction could lead to wildly different treatment plans — on policy, on personnel and on political priorities. One early focus has been on whether the party’s message or its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/us/politics/democratic-influencers.html" title="">difficulties in delivering that message</a> is more to blame.</p><p>Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington, who served as the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2024 and is staying on to oversee the party’s efforts to take the majority in 2026, noted that House Democrats “actually gained ground in 2024.” She blamed an unusual <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/us/politics/2024-elections-congress-state-redistricting.html" title="">Republican redrawing</a> of congressional maps in a single state last year for her party’s continued minority status.</p><p>“Except for North Carolina doing a gerrymander, we’d be in the majority,” she said of a remapping that prompted three Democratic incumbents to abandon hopes of re-election.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington, blamed a Republican redrawing of congressional maps in North Carolina last year for her party’s continued minority status in the House.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Others pointed to the relatively slim 1.5-percentage-point margin of Mr. Trump’s popular vote victory, and to the fact that Democrats won Senate races in four states that Mr. Trump carried — an unusually high number to split their ticket in the current hyperpartisan era.</p><p>“We know what an electoral mandate looks like for a president and his party, and it is not losing a House seat and losing four of the five swing-state Senate contests,” said Neera Tanden, who served in the White House for the last three Democratic presidents, including as director of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s domestic policy council.</p><p>“There is work the party needs to do to be more compelling with working-class people — on economic and security issues,” Ms. Tanden continued. “But Trump’s popular-vote margin was less than half Biden’s four years ago.”</p><p>Of course, parties that enter periods of soul-searching are often blind to what exactly they are looking for: Republicans famously ordered <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-autopsy/id1142083165?i=1000579554417" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a political autopsy</a> after their 2012 loss and recommended a rebranding that was, more or less, the opposite of the strident, strict approach to immigration that Mr. Trump used to return the party to power in 2016.</p><p>For Democrats, the recommendations could vary widely, given the range of groups making them: Dozens of congressional progressives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/trump-democrats-republicans.html" title="">recently met</a> on Capitol Hill to settle on a message to counter Mr. Trump. A Democratic super PAC and nonprofit, American Bridge, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/democratic-donors.html" title="">is holding</a> a retreat for its donors next month. And Third Way, a centrist Democratic group, is organizing a gathering in February to discuss how to “empower moderate and mainstream views and voices.”</p><p>Such air-clearing conversations are not happening in every corner of the party.</p><p>Top officials on the Kamala Harris campaign and the leaders of the leading super PAC that supported her, Future Forward, have not sat down since the election for a formal discussion of what went wrong in their multibillion-dollar spending blitz. Campaign finance law prohibited such conversations during the election, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/elections/future-forward-kamala-harris-ads.html" title="">tensions rose</a> between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/harris-trump-campaign-fascism.html" title="">the two sides</a>.</p><p>Future Forward’s leadership reached out to suggest a summit of sorts on lessons learned, but such a gathering was declined by the Harris side, according to three people briefed on the outreach, though they said there had been some informal communications across the divide.</p><p>Some Democrats see the party’s losses in 2024 as more situational than systemic. They blame Mr. Biden for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/biden-debate-performance.html" title="">ignoring polling</a> that showed the public was gravely troubled by his age, and for withdrawing so late and in such a politically weakened state that Ms. Harris effectively inherited his unpopularity without enough time to carve out a separate identity for herself.</p><p>“There were people who were just very unhappy with the incumbent administration, and all they needed to know about Harris was she worked with Biden,” said Jared Bernstein, who was the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers for Mr. Biden.</p><p>Mr. Bernstein warned against “over-interpretation” of the 2024 result, which he said aligned with a worldwide backlash against parties in power over inflation.</p><p>“It was largely a global anti-incumbency — in our case very much fueled by immigration and inflation,” he said. “We might have been able to overcome that had we been able to launch a compelling defense of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/trump-republican-transgender-ads.html" title="">pronouns versus paychecks</a>.

Bush’s 2004 re-election.)</p><p>“Nobody can say that this was a landslide — hell, I was Walter Mondale’s policy director in 1984, and I got buried under one,” said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p><p>But Mr. Galston said that focusing on the closeness of the popular vote masked unnerving movements beneath the surface, like Gallup <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/655157/gop-holds-edge-party-affiliation-third-straight-year.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> showing that more Americans have identified or leaned Republican than Democratic for three straight years. That had not been the case in a single year since 1991, when the G.O.P. had won the last three presidential elections.</p><p>Back then, when Democrats were in the wilderness, Mr. Galston and Elaine Kamarck, a longtime Democratic National Committee member, wrote <a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Politics_of_Evasion.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a paper</a> together called “The Politics of Evasion” — a critique of those who made excuses for the party’s electoral shortcomings, rather than facing up to serious problems — that became a manifesto for the party’s post-Reagan revival.</p><p>In 2022, the two, who are both fellows at Brookings, published a <a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/the-new-politics-of-evasion%20%5Bprogressivepolicy-org%5D/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revised warning</a>, prescribing a course of “reality therapy” to Democrats, including over the party’s “cultural bubble,” which they said put many in the party out of touch with less-educated or lower-income Americans.</p><p>Mr. Galston said he and Ms. Kamarck were getting “the band back together for the last time” to draft a post-2024 update.</p><p>“It makes sense to break the glass and pull the fire alarm,” he said of the party’s predicament.</p><p>Some Democrats have aimed a spotlight at the long-term erosion of voter registration in key states, which seemed to come due in 2024. In Pennsylvania, the most recent figures show the Democratic edge in the state at roughly 189,000 voters — down sharply from 916,000 when Mr. Trump carried the state in 2016, and from over 325,000 as recently as last October.</p><p>But Molly Murphy, a Democratic pollster who worked on the Biden and Harris campaigns, urged her party to focus exclusively on solutions.</p><p>“We don’t even need to debate how deep the hole is,” she said. “What Democrats need to do is act like we’re in a very deep hole — and if it turns up, upon climbing out, we weren’t in a deep hole, then that’s spoils to us.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM3ODFhNDY5LWZlMDctNTlhNy05NDUzLTJhN2M4OGFlMTQwZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/dnc-chair-news#chair-democratic-national-committee" data-source-id="100000009837018"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/simon-j-levien"><img alt="Simon J.
