The annual competition has grown into a nationally televised event that draws competitors from around the nation and the globe.

Bruhat, who had tied for 74th place at the 2023 bee and 163rd place in 2022, told The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/30/us/scripps-spelling-bee" title="">after his victory</a> that winning the spelling bee was “like a dream come true.”</p><p>“Instead of going down, I decided to be really motivated by that,” Bruhat said of his previous attempts, “so don’t be discouraged by failure.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
