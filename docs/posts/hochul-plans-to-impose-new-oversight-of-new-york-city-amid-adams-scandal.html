    <h1>Hochul Plans to Impose New Oversight of New York City Amid Adams Scandal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The steps Ms. Hochul plans to propose include creating a new state deputy inspector general dedicated to New York City; establishing a fund for the city comptroller, public advocate and City Council speaker to hire outside counsel to sue the federal government if the mayor is unwilling to do so; and granting additional funds for the state’s comptroller to scrutinize city finances.</p><p>The governor also wants to impose a new rule that would bar the mayor from firing the head of the city’s Department of Investigation without the approval of the state inspector general.</p><p>The proposals, which had yet to be finalized ahead of an afternoon announcement, were described by the officials familiar with the governor’s thinking who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Adams did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Ms. Hochul has spent days deliberating how to approach Mr. Adams’s future as growing numbers of fellow Democrats call for his resignation or for her to use her constitutional authority to remove him from office.</p><p>No governor in New York’s 235-year history has removed a mayor elected by the voters, and people who have spoken with Ms. Hochul about the possibility said it was clear she had grave concerns about the precedent that could be set by doing so now. Mr. Adams has insisted he will not quit voluntarily.</p></div></div>
