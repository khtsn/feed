Brown, who grew up in Georgia, introduced himself and thanked the crowd in Arabic to more cheers.</p><p>“I’ve been working on my Arabic,” he said later.</p><p>It was a festive beginning on Friday to the N.B.A.’s third annual trip to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, for preseason games. This time the league sent its past two champions, the Celtics and the Denver Nuggets, along with the championship trophy and several former N.B.A. players, including the Celtics great Kevin Garnett.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Abu Dhabi has become the N.B.A.’s hub in the Middle East. The players visited cultural sites, league and team personnel met with business partners, and the league showcased the work it has done with children, especially girls, in the region. Abu Dhabi in turn presented its modernization, luxury resorts, low crime rates and commitment to religious tolerance — a message prominently displayed at its cultural sites.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jaden Springer with the ball in the second game, played at Etihad Arena on Sunday. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Watching from the second row was Jamad Fiin, a Somali American basketball player. She also joined a panel discussion that was a part of the N.B.A.’s visit. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But shading the edges of the event was the murky ethical space that companies enter when they do business in countries like the Emirates, which is ruled as an autocracy with limits to freedom of expression, speech and the press, and which provides arms to fighters accused of atrocities in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/world/africa/uae-sudan-civil-war.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">devastating civil war in Sudan</a>. Criticizing the government or its leaders is illegal and can lead to long prison sentences, and workers are often subject to inhumane or life-threatening conditions, according to human rights groups and the State Department.</p><p>As the N.B.A. expands globally, the league has confronted questions about which governments it chooses as partners. Human rights watchers have condemned its relationships in China, Rwanda and the Emirates, saying they help repressive regimes distract from their bad acts. It is a criticism leveled at many sports and entertainment attractions — from the World Cup and Formula 1 to Netflix and pop stars — that have increasingly done business in the region in recent years.</p><p>“They’ve done this incredible job of making the U.A.E. and Emirates synonymous with sports,” said Ben Freeman of the Quincy Institute, an American think tank that focuses on foreign policy, said of the country’s leaders. “When you think of the U.A.E., they want you thinking about tennis. They would love for you to think about the N.B.A.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On the court, drives to the basket.

And ultimately, it’s a decision that engagement, and we see it firsthand, is positive for these communities and that we don’t believe we would benefit these markets by either divesting or disengaging.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The U.S. ambassador to the Emirates, Martina Strong, attended Friday night’s game. When asked why she supported the N.B.A.’s involvement in the Emirates despite concerns raised by human rights groups, Ms. Strong sent a written response. She did not address human rights issues, and said her office was “proud” of the N.B.A.’s partnership in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>“We commend the N.B.A.’s commitment to promoting universal values — teamwork, sportsmanship, partnership and diversity — that transcend borders and cultures,” Ms. Strong said. She added that the league’s work expanding “access to basketball and encouraging greater female participation reflects the broader mission of the United States to support inclusivity and create opportunities for all.”</p><p>Though women still face some legal and economic discrimination, according to the State Department and human rights groups, the Emirates has made significant <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/11/1071880009/uae-laws-business-sex-marriage-alcohol-cbd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reforms to legislation regarding women in recent years</a>. There are laws criminalizing same-sex relations, but they are not usually enforced, the State Department said.</p><p>Mr. Silver said the league looked at how the broader business community engaged with the country. New York University and Microsoft both have a presence in Abu Dhabi. Warner Bros. has a theme park here. The Guggenheim Foundation plans to open a museum. The league chose Abu Dhabi over interest from other cities, including Dubai, which is also in the Emirates, and Doha, Qatar.</p><p>The Emirates’ work with the N.B.A. fits a broader pattern of seeking influence in the United States, Mr. Freeman said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“They have influenced every possible vector that there is,” he said. “They have this sort of all-star team of lobbyists and P.R. firms working for them<em>.”</em></p><p>The Emirati Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Several public relations firms were engaged during the N.B.A.’s stay in Abu Dhabi to promote the event and tourism in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Human rights groups are skeptical that sports effect enough change in repressive countries to make their presence a net positive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A youth event included a trampoline-launched dunking demonstration by Lucky the Leprechaun, the Celtics’ mascot.  </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The young fans also spent time with the Celtics star Jaylen Brown.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Human Rights Watch said on its website that it had <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/10/03/uae-nba-games-risk-sportswashing-abuses" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent a letter to the N.B.A. on Sept. 30 asking the league to take action to address human rights issues in the Emirates</a>.</p><p>Mr. Silver said the Emirati government did not impose any restrictions on the league’s operations in Abu Dhabi, and that if it did the league would not have come. He also disagreed that the N.B.A.’s presence helped hide abuses.</p><p>“Sports brings disproportionate attention, it seems, to issues positive and negative,” Mr. Silver said. “And I think what comes with this region attracting high-profile sports, no different from the World Cup that took place in Qatar, there’s been enormous amount of discussion around people’s opinions of those markets and the activities there.”</p><p>The Middle East is a valuable market for the N.B.A. for several reasons. As governments in the region have looked to diversify their economies away from oil and gas, they have spent billions of dollars on sports teams and leagues and major sporting events. And the area’s riches can be a boon for the league. In addition to sponsorships from Emirati entities, sovereign wealth funds are allowed to buy small stakes in N.B.A. teams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Having practiced his Arabic, Brown found a more familiar pregame ritual where his name alone did the trick. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joe Mazzulla, the coach of the Celtics, addressing members of the media in Abu Dhabi. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>As it does in other markets, the N.B.A. encourages participation in basketball as a way to build a fan base. It says basketball participation has grown 60 percent in the Emirates and 54 percent in the Middle East since 2022, when the league began playing games here.</p><p>Both the Celtics and the Nuggets wanted to be a part of the trip to Abu Dhabi, said Mark Tatum, the N.B.A.’s deputy commissioner.</p><p>“We’re a global brand, the Celtics, just like the N.B.A.,” said Rich Gotham, the team’s president. “This is a region of, sort of, exponentially growing fandom outside of the U.S.”</p><p>The Celtics began a sponsorship deal with Experience Abu Dhabi, an extension of the Department of Culture and Tourism, in March in line with discussions about playing in Abu Dhabi. As part of that partnership, they unveiled a basketball court in Abu Dhabi during their trip. A Celtics logo covers center court, and the rest of the floor is decorated with designs from local blanket weavers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-23"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A new basketball court featuring local blanket designs and a logo from 6,600 miles away.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural honoring the Hall of Famer Kobe Bryant at an Abu Dhabi park.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Celtics also visited the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque as a team, and a group went to the <a href="https://www.abrahamicfamilyhouse.ae/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Abrahamic Family House</a>, which includes a mosque, a synagogue and a church and promotes religious tolerance. That trip was particularly meaningful to Coach Joe Mazzulla, who is vocal about his Christian faith.</p><p>“It was one of the most beautiful places that I’ve been,” Mr. Mazzulla said.</p><p>The Nuggets also visited those cultural sites and took a trip to the desert. Some of their players rode camels, including the 6-foot-11 DeAndre Jordan. A Nuggets contingent including the star center Nikola Jokic visited Dubai, where his former team from Serbia played over the weekend.</p><p>“From a business standpoint, the brand awareness is incredible that you can build coming over here,” said Josh Kroenke, the vice chairman of Kroenke Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Nuggets. “And on a team level I think it’s great because it gets our guys out of Denver, exposes them to a region of the world that maybe some of them hadn’t been before.”</p><p>Mr. Kroenke said he had never been to the Middle East before, despite having some business connections with the region. He was eager to be part of the trip and now says he can’t wait to return. He is co-chair of the English Premier League soccer club Arsenal, which has sponsorships with Emirates, an airline owned by Dubai’s government. The airline also sponsors the N.B.A.’s in-season tournament.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Kroenke declined to comment when asked about sportswashing concerns.</p><p>Mr. Gotham said the Celtics preferred to focus on the positive impact they could make.</p><p>“We don’t look at it politically,” he said. “We look at it and say, ‘What is a good contribution that we can make?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The audience for a panel that included Fiin and Allison Feaster, a Celtics executive, at the Jr. N.B.A.’s Her Time to Play clinic. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>There’s a time for talk, and — encouraged by the former W.N.B.A. star Sylvia Fowles, who was also on the panel — there’s a time for running. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>He mentioned a basketball clinic that included 130 girls and featured a panel in which a Celtics executive, Allison Feaster, took part.
