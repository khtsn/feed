    <h1>Delta Crash Adds to Snow Disruptions at Toronto Airport</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The crash of a Delta Air Lines jet on Monday afternoon exacerbated travel disruptions at Toronto Pearson International Airport, which was already juggling a slew of flight delays and cancellations caused by major back-to-back snowstorms.</p><p>Nearly 400 flights had been canceled at Pearson on Monday night, and more than 300 others were delayed at the airport, according to FlightAware, an aviation tracking website.</p><p>The airport stopped operations for over two hours after the Delta plane crashed and flipped over as it attempted to land. Operations resumed at about 5 p.m. but two of the airportâ€™s five runways remained closed.</p><p>Toronto Pearson had <a href="https://x.com/TorontoPearson/status/1891459206932209806" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected Monday to be busy</a> as airlines tried to catch up after a snowstorm on the weekend dumped over eight inches of snow at the airport. On Sunday, more than 300 flights were canceled and more than 500 were delayed, according to FlightAware.</p><p>That was on top of the disruptions caused by another snowstorm last week, which dropped more snow in one day at the airport than in all of January, <a href="https://x.com/TorontoPearson/status/1890068457321803803" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toronto Pearson said</a> Thursday.</p><p>The airport said its crews had been working around the clock in recent days to clear snow from <a href="https://x.com/TorontoPearson/status/1891507105208655897" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 1,200 acres</a> to ensure planes could land and take off.</p></div></div>
