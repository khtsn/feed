The plume is expected to fall apart in coming days, with some dust moving into the southeast Atlantic Ocean, potentially grazing Georgia and South Carolina, and some scattering across the Gulf, likely filtering into as far as Texas by Friday and into the weekend.</p><p>“We’ll see that ramp up over South Florida in the next 18 to 24 hours,” said George Rizzuto, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Miami. “It will linger through the end of the week.”</p><h2 id="link-7c6bcf79">The dust is lifted off the Sahara by winds.</h2><p>The Saharan Air Layer forms when winds lift sand and minerals from the Sahara in North Africa into the atmosphere. It then gets whisked away by a strong wind current, which sometimes pushes it north into Europe, but more commonly carries it west across the Atlantic Ocean. It usually reaches the Caribbean and the Gulf Coast region several times a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The dust events occur year-round but are most common from about mid-May into August, usually peaking mid-June to July.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/weather/saharan-dust-florida-gulf-coast.html" title="">Earlier forecasts had indicated</a> that a cloud of dust would travel from the Caribbean into the Gulf Coast region, but on Wednesday a weather system off the coast of Florida appeared likely to disrupt and diffuse the dust plume.</p><p>“It was looking like we were going to get a big slug of dust along the Gulf Coast, now that has trended more toward Florida, Georgia and South Carolina,” said Paul Miller, an assistant professor of coastal meteorology at Louisiana State University. “It looks like the heaviest dust is going to remain offshore.”</p><p>Mr. Miller said a ribbon of dust was still expected to push into Louisiana and southeast Texas, most likely Friday night into Saturday.</p><p>Houston is expected to see impacts by Friday afternoon and evening and continuing into the weekend. “Still expecting the main impacts to be hazy skies during the day and a decrease in air quality,” said Jimmy Fowler, a meteorologist with the Weather Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Coastal areas of Mississippi and Alabama may also see some dust.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A group of people are silhouetted against a hazy hillside as they walk toward the left of the frame." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9740acde-194f-5b93-b777-6b5aa5268c47" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The dust caused hazy skies in San Juan, P.R., earlier this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ricardo Arduengo/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-469810a9">Over Puerto Rico, the dust looked like a ‘huge fog.’</h2><p>On its journey east, the curtain of dust shrouded skies over Puerto Rico Saturday night into Tuesday.</p><p>Skies were hazy, and visibility at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport dropped to five miles.
