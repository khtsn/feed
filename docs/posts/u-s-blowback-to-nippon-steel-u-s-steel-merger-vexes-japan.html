But now behind closed doors, some are bristling at reports that Mr. Biden intends to sink <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/business/nippon-steel-us-steel.html" title="">Japan’s $15 billion acquisition</a> of U.S. Steel.</p><p>Japan’s economy ministry has sought meetings with and conveyed concerns to U.S. officials after news emerged of Mr. Biden’s intention to take executive action to stop the merger, said two people with knowledge of the outreach who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>The political storm risks straining relations at a time when Tokyo and Washington are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/business/economy/japan-industrial-policy-rapidus.html" title="">working to deepen ties</a> to counterbalance China’s growing economic and military influence in Asia. On the economic front, the United States has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/business/economy/netherlands-japan-china-chips.html" title="">pressuring</a> Japan to impose additional restrictions on the ability of its firms to sell advanced chip-making tools to China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The U.S. has pushed Japan to not only follow but take more initiative in promoting rules-based order in the Pacific, and in recent years it has really stepped up,” said William Chou, the deputy director of the Hudson Institute’s Japan Chair.</p><p>If American politicians move to scuttle a close ally’s planned merger, “Japan may move to take more of a back seat, letting the U.S. take the lead and following only when it is clear on what the American temperature of the day is,” he said. “That will be a great loss.”</p><p>Even as Nippon Steel’s bid has caused some frictions between the United States and Japan, elsewhere big companies from both countries continue to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/business/economy/japan-industrial-policy-rapidus.html" title="">collaborate</a> on technology development.</p><p>The United States and Japan are “on very solid ground,” and they will continue to be top investors in each other, Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said in a statement. “The U.S.-Japan relationship is deeper, richer, and stronger than any single commercial transaction,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Japan’s economy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden is said to be ready take executive action to stop the merger.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last year, when U.S. Steel put itself up for sale, Nippon Steel and Japanese officials saw an opportunity. The United States is a higher-profit market for steel makers because Washington has imposed tariffs that ward off low-cost Chinese steel.</p><p>The Biden administration has also worked to forge closer ties with Japan and other allies in an attempt to contain China and Russia.</p><p>After the steel merger was announced jointly by both companies last December, Nippon Steel cut ties with its joint-venture partner in China and pitched the combined U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel entity as a champion of free-market economies capable of taking on China, which produces more than half of the world’s steel.</p><p>Officials in Tokyo have been taken aback by the backlash in the United States.</p><p>Some politicians from both countries as well as industry analysts said Nippon Steel was essentially extending a lifeline to U.S. Steel, a one-time pillar of the American economy that has fallen behind rivals and lost market share. Nippon Steel has promised to invest billions of dollars in U.S. Steel facilities.</p><p>U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel “entered into this deal based on the idea that they could create a win-win relationship,” Akira Amari, a senior official in Japan’s ruling party, said in a recent interview. “U.S. Steel would be able to absorb Nippon Steel’s technologies, and its competitive edge would be strengthened.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Japan “understands that U.S. steel is a symbol of America,” Mr. Amari said. “But discussions should be pursued in a calm environment about what kind of solutions Nippon Steel has to offer,” he said.</p><p>Analysts, politicians, business leaders and lawyers involved in cross-border deals have raised concerns that a decision by Washington to block the deal on national security grounds could make some foreign companies think twice about investing in the United States.</p><p>Japan is the largest source of foreign direct investment in the United States. After years of building up profits because of a weakened yen, Japanese companies have become more interested in making deals and looked to the United States in particular for potential opportunities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>U.S. Steel was once a pillar of the American economy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gene J.

Recent public polling shows that Pennsylvania is essentially a tossup in the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald J. Trump, making it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/us/politics/us-steel-nippon-pennsylvania.html" title="">critical</a> to win the support of the steelworkers’ union.</p><p>Leaders of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/business/nippon-steel-us-steel.html" title="">United Steelworkers union</a> have said they are unhappy with the terms offered to them by Nippon Steel and have argued that a foreign corporation’s purchase of an American steel company would endanger national security. Some in Japan contest those claims.</p><p>“It is very difficult to imagine Nippon Steel’s acquisition of U.S. Steel posing a threat,” said Takahide Kiuchi, an executive economist at Nomura Research Institute. “The U.S. government’s stance on blocking investments from Japan, an ally, could negatively impact the trust between Japan and the U.S., potentially leaving a lasting future problem,” he said.</p><p>In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has been scrutinizing the bid over potential risks. Although the panel has raised concerns about the agreement with U.S. Steel, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/politics/biden-us-steel-nippon.html" title="">White House official</a> said this week that CFIUS had yet to make a recommendation about the transaction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Nick Wall, a Tokyo partner specializing in mergers and acquisitions at the law firm A&amp;O Shearman, said the steel merger engendered particularly complicated political calculations. Still, he added, its demise could send worrying signals.</p><p>“Sophisticated bidders will see it for what it is, a unique situation and very unfortunate timing,” Mr. Wall said. “But overall the message it sends about the U.S.’s openness is not good,” he said.</p><p>Hisako Ueno<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-15"></div></section><div><div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/river-akira-davis">More about River Akira Davis</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Student Loan Debt Plan:</strong> The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/supreme-court-biden-student-loans.html">maintained a temporary pause</a> on a new effort by President Biden to wipe out tens and perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars of student debt. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/business/biden-student-loan-debt-plan.html">Here’s what the ruling means for borrowers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Undocumented Spouses:</strong> A federal judge temporarily blocked a Biden administration program that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/us/undocumented-spouses-biden-administration.html">could offer a path to citizenship for up to half a million undocumented immigrants</a> who are married to U.S. citizens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asylum Restrictions:</strong> In the months since Biden imposed sweeping restrictions on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, the policy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/us/politics/biden-asylum-restrictions.html">appears to be working exactly as he hoped and his critics feared</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secret Nuclear Strategy:</strong> In a classified document approved in March, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html">the president ordered U.S. forces to prepare</a> for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drug Price Limits: </strong>The Biden administration announced the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/drug-prices-medicare.html">results of landmark negotiations</a> between Medicare and pharmaceutical companies over the prices of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/drug-prices-medicare-negotiations.html">10 costly or common medications</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
