By then, “the area where our positions had been was already occupied by Russian forces,” he said when reached by phone.</p><p>At the height of the offensive, Ukrainian forces controlled some 500 square miles of Russian territory. By Sunday, they were clinging to barely 30 square miles along the Russia-Ukraine border, according to Pasi Paroinen, a military analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group.</p><p>“The end of the battle is coming,” Mr. Paroinen said in a phone interview.</p><p>How much Russian territory Ukraine still controls in Kursk could not be independently confirmed, and soldiers reported fierce fighting was ongoing. But the fighting near the border is now less about holding Russian land, Ukrainian soldiers said, and more about trying to prevent Russian forces from pouring into the Sumy region of Ukraine and opening a new front in the war.</p><p>The soldiers said they are trying to set up strong defensive positions along ridgelines on the Russian side of the border.</p><p>“We continue to hold positions on the Kursk front,” said Boroda, the assault platoon commander. “The only difference is that our positions have shifted significantly closer to the border.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Andrii, a Ukrainian intelligence officer fighting in Kursk, put it more bluntly: “The Kursk operation is essentially over” he said. “Now we need to stabilize the situation.”</p><p>The Kursk operation was seen by some analysts as an unnecessary gamble, stretching Ukraine’s troops and leading to heavy casualties at a time when they were already struggling to defend a long front line in their own country. But it provided a much-needed morale boost to Ukraine, which had sought to show it could bring the war home to Russia and had hoped the territory it occupied there would serve as leverage in any cease-fire negotiations.</p><p>While Kyiv has managed to stall Russia’s advance in eastern Ukraine, the turn in Kursk comes as the Trump administration is pushing for a quick truce.</p><p>The reversal of Ukraine’s fortunes in Kursk did not come down to any one factor. Russian forces pounded Ukraine’s supply lines and began to cut off escape routes. North Korean troops brought in by Moscow, who faltered at first, improved their combat capabilities. And at a crucial moment, U.S. support — including intelligence sharing — was put on hold.</p><h2 id="link-59437aa5">How the tide turned</h2><p>When The New York Times last visited the border between Sumy and Kursk in late January, daytime movement was nearly impossible because the skies were filled with Russian drones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The main road from Sumy to Sudzha, a small Russian town about six miles to the northeast that Ukrainian forces had occupied since August, was already littered with burned-out cars, tanks and armored vehicles.</p><p>Ukraine had dispatched some of its most experienced brigades to the Kursk operation, but months of unrelenting assaults by Russian forces and the thousands of North Korean troops fighting alongside them were taking a growing toll.</p><p>While the North Korean troops had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/europe/north-korea-troops-ukraine-russia.html" title="">withdrawn</a> from the battlefield in January to regroup, they returned to the fight in early February.

Not everyone made it out, but most did, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-197b718c">Russia’s breakthrough moment</h2><p>Ukraine’s hold in Kursk was already in danger when the Trump administration announced the suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing on March 3.</p><p>The sudden loss of American intelligence for precise targeting compounded the difficulties, according to Andrii, the intelligence officer. Without it, he and other soldiers said, the American-made multiple-rocket launchers known as HIMARS fell silent.</p><p>“We could not allow expensive missiles to be fired at the wrong target,” Andrii explained.</p><p>Then on March 8, Russian troops made a breakthrough, sneaking behind Ukrainian lines by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-sudzha-russian-forces.html" title="">walking for miles through a disused gas pipeline</a> to stage a surprise attack. Russian propagandists and officials cast the operation as a heroic feat, while Ukrainian sources called it a risky move that they claimed had led to many deaths caused by residual methane in the pipeline.</p><p>While the exact number of Russian troops involved and the success of the attack was impossible to independently confirm, “it caused enough confusion and havoc behind Ukrainian lines that it likely triggered them to start withdrawing,” said Mr. Paroinen from Black Bird Group, which analyzes satellite imagery and social media content from the battlefield.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Russians “outplayed us a bit,” Andrii said. “There was a little panic.”</p><p>At around the same time, North Korean troops were helping lead an assault that broke through Ukrainian lines south of the small village of Kurylivka, further constraining Kyiv’s ability to supply its troops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Razor wire defenses in the forest in the Sumy region of Ukraine, along the border with Russia, earlier this year. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Finbarr O&#39;Reilly for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>As Ukrainian forces there retreated along designated defensive lines, Russian forces kept pushing toward Sudzha and the pace of attacks increased.</p><p>Given the Russian positions, evacuating by vehicle would have given drones an easy target, analysts said. And the destroyed military vehicles littering the roads also created obstacles for a retreat — which is why a “significant part of the withdrawal was done on foot,” according to Serhii Hrabskyi, a military analyst and former Ukrainian Army colonel.</p><p>Some Ukrainian soldiers burned their own equipment to prevent it from falling into Russian hands before hiking out, soldiers said.</p><p>On March 10, the order was issued for some units to withdraw from Sudzha, three Ukrainian soldiers and commanders said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“It was a mix of organized and chaotic retreat,” Boroda said. “Various factors influenced the nature of the withdrawal: fatigue, good or poor orders from individual commanders, miscommunication or well-established coordination.”</p><p>However, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin.html" title="">claims to the contrary</a> made by President Vladimir V.
