    <h1>In 2014, Florida State University Reeled From Another Shooting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Florida State University, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/17/us/fsu-shooting-tallahassee" title="">a gunman killed two people</a> and injured six others on Thursday, has been haunted by gun violence before. In 2014, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/us/florida-state-university-shooting.html" title="">a gunman shot three people</a> at a library on campus before he was killed by the police.</p><p>In that shooting, a burst of gunfire sent hundreds of bystanders fleeing or hiding among bookshelves at Strozier Library in the middle of the fall semester. The gunman, a 31-year-old graduate named Myron May, wounded two students and a library employee who survived.</p><p>The gunman had reloaded once before he was killed by the police outside the library building, the authorities said at the time.</p><p>The gunman had believed the government was watching him, and that he had detailed his fears in a written journal and videos, officials said at the time. He had no criminal record with the Tallahassee Police Department or the Leon County Sheriffâ€™s Office, the authorities said in 2014.</p></div></div>
