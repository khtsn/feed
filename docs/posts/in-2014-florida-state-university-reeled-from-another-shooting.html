In 2014, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/us/florida-state-university-shooting.html" title="">a gunman shot three people</a> at a library on campus before he was killed by the police.</p><p>In that shooting, a burst of gunfire sent hundreds of bystanders fleeing or hiding among bookshelves at Strozier Library in the middle of the fall semester. The gunman, a 31-year-old graduate named Myron May, wounded two students and a library employee who survived.</p><p>The gunman had reloaded once before he was killed by the police outside the library building, the authorities said at the time.</p><p>The gunman had believed the government was watching him, and that he had detailed his fears in a written journal and videos, officials said at the time. He had no criminal record with the Tallahassee Police Department or the Leon County Sheriffâ€™s Office, the authorities said in 2014.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police chief at the time, Michael DeLeo, credited security measures that allowed only students and staff to enter the library with preventing more bloodshed. The gunman had been carrying a .38-caliber handgun and additional ammunition in his pockets, but he left the library after he was unable to make it past the security barriers, Chief DeLeo said then.</p><p>One of the students who was injured, Farhan Ahmed, was left paralyzed after the shooting, according to <a href="https://www.wtxl.com/news/local-news/remembering-strozier-library-shooting-five-years-later" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WTXL</a>, a TV station in Tallahassee. In 2019, Florida State University and Mr. Ahmed reached a $1 million settlement, <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2019/01/24/ronny-ahmed-fsu-reach-1-m-settlement/2671330002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Tallahassee Democrat reported</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.
