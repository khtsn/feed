Her decision to do so on Wednesday could help accelerate growing doubts about Mr. Adams’s hold on City Hall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Revelations related to a web of investigations involving Mr. Adams and senior members of his administration have been emerging almost daily for weeks.</p><p>Earlier this month, federal agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-sheena-fbi-search-nyc.html?searchResultPosition=9" title="">seized the phones</a> of the police commissioner, the first deputy mayor, the schools chancellor, the deputy mayor for public safety and a senior adviser close to Mr. Adams.</p><p>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/nyregion/fbi-adams-qatar-israel-china-uzbekistan-korea.html" title="">reported on Monday</a> that federal prosecutors investigating whether Mr. Adams conspired with the Turkish government to funnel illegal foreign donations to his campaign had also sought information about interactions with five other countries.</p><p>On Tuesday, the schools chancellor became the latest high-ranking official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/nyregion/david-banks-resigns-nyc-schools-chancellor.html" title="">to announce he was departing</a>. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">police commissioner</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/nyregion/lisa-zornberg-resigns-eric-adams-counsel.html" title="">city’s top lawyer</a> have already resigned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Neither Mr. Adams nor his closest confidants have been formally accused of wrongdoing. In a statement on Wednesday, he rebuffed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s resignation call, saying he would “stay and fight no matter what,” and criticizing her views on criminal justice policy.</p><p>“For anyone who self-righteously claims people charged with serious crimes should not be in jail to now say that the second Black mayor of New York should resign because of rumors and innuendo — without even a single charge being filed — is the height of hypocrisy,” Mr. Adams said. “I am leading this city to protect it from exactly that kind of phony politics.”</p><p>The mayor has also tried in recent days to minimize the significance of the departures from his administration.</p><p>“We are constantly bringing in new people,” he told reporters at City Hall on Tuesday. “So let’s not give the image that all of a sudden, there are people saying, ‘Hey, I don’t want to be in city government.’”</p><p>A handful of other New York lawmakers, almost all of them democratic socialists, have urged Mr. Adams to step down in recent days. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is by far the most influential elected official to have called for the mayor’s resignation and the first member of Congress to do so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The congresswoman, who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, has never been close to the mayor. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/05/nyregion/aoc-maya-wiley-endorsement-nyc-mayor.html" title="">endorsed one of Mr. Adams’s opponents</a> in the 2021 Democratic mayoral primary, and has criticized his handling of the city’s migrant crisis.</p><p>She is also close to multiple Democrats who have either announced campaigns to run against Mr. Adams next year or are considering entering the race, including Brad Lander, the city comptroller, and Assemblyman Zohran K. Mamdani.</p><p>Other prominent Democrats appear, for now, to be willing to wait for the outcome of the investigations, even if they are not defending Mr. Adams.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a New Yorker who leads House Democrats, said Mr. Adams was “working as hard as he can to be the best mayor possible.”</p><p>“We need Eric Adams to be successful as mayor because he is the mayor at this moment in time,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>22</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Ocasio-Cortez Calls On Adams to Step Down<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
