    <h1>Who Were the Victims Killed in the New Orleans Attack on New Year’s?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many of them had arrived on Bourbon Street on New Year’s Eve to celebrate the promise of the year to come: a woman on the cusp of starting her studies to become a nurse, a father of two spending time with his cousin, a former Princeton University football player.</p><p>But at around 3:15 a.m., a Texas man drove his truck through the crowd of revelers, killing at least 14 people and injuring dozens more, before opening fire. The injured include two police officers who confronted the driver, two Israeli citizens and a University of Georgia student.</p><p>This is what we have learned about some of those who died in the attack.</p><h3 id="link-2841bdbc"><span><strong>Hubert Gauthreaux</strong></span></h3><p>Hubert Gauthreaux, 21, told his family he was heading to the Riverwalk to watch the fireworks on New Year’s Eve. His sister, Brooke Gauthreaux, 26, teased him about not wanting to hang out at home with her and their mother, but before he left she told him she loved him, according to Ms. Gauthreaux.</p><p>After midnight, Hubert texted his family, wishing them a happy new year.</p><p>When they woke the next morning, Ms. Gauthreaux said, their mother instinctively checked Mr. Gauthreaux’s phone location and discovered that he had ventured to Bourbon Street. When they heard about the attack, they “went into panic mode,” she said.</p><p>The family drove to the University Medical Center and waited. Later that afternoon, they learned that he had died.</p><p>Someone from the hospital prayed with them. “And then we all wailed for probably another two hours together until we could muster up enough energy to come home,” Ms. Gauthreaux said.</p><p>Mr. Gauthreaux was a selfless family member with a big heart, who would call for random check-ins and drop anything to help someone, according to his sister.</p><p>“Just last week, he took a tire off his car to let his friend borrow, and he drove around on a spare tire,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Gauthreaux had been recently trying to step up his fashion sense, his sister recalled. “I’m wearing his sweatshirt right now,” she said through tears, after going through his half-done laundry. She also came across a Camaro jacket she’d purchased for him. Walking around Target one day, she spotted it and texted a picture to her brother. He had to have it, so she bought it for him.</p><p>“I think he got to wear it once,” she said. “He was my best friend.”</p><h3 id="link-1885846f"><span>Drew Dauphin</span></h3><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Drew Dauphin</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Margaret Dauphin</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Drew Dauphin, 26, was in New Orleans from Alabama with his little brother, Matthew. They had gone to a concert and, later, to eat pizza. Ten minutes before the attack, they had separated, said Becky Devereux, a friend who spoke on behalf of the family.</p><p>Mr. Dauphin was a supply process manager at Honda, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-dauphin-9025a5272/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> page. He graduated from Auburn University last year, the school’s president, Christopher B. Roberts, said in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEVG6IhvXcw/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p><p>“Words cannot convey the sorrow the Auburn family feels for Drew’s family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time,” Mr. Roberts said. “Our thoughts are with the Dauphin family and the families of all the victims of this senseless tragedy.”</p><p>Ms. Devereux described Mr. Dauphin as “a great friend to all.” On Thursday morning, his mother told Ms. Devereux that “it was like Christmas morning when he came home.”</p><p>A statement issued by the family said that Mr. Dauphin and his relatives were “dependent on each other,” and that he enjoyed being on Lake Martin in Alabama with his brother Matthew.</p><p>“We did not get to spend enough time with him and can’t believe we will never see him again this side of heaven,” the statement said.</p><h3 id="link-1f056636"><span>Kareem Badawi</span></h3><p>Kareem Badawi recently finished his first semester at the University of Alabama, where he majored in mechanical engineering. While he was home in Baton Rouge, La., for the holidays, he and his friends decided to celebrate the New Year in New Orleans.</p><p>“They say, ‘Let’s go there and have fun and let’s make this year special,’” Mr. Badawi’s father, Belal Badawi, recalled in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Badawi, 18, was social and had many friends, his father said. He was the youngest of three children and cared for his family. At the university, he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. He told his father he wanted to go to school in Alabama because he wanted to see a different state.</p><p>“He loves people,” Mr. Badawi said.</p><p>In a <a href="https://news.ua.edu/2025/01/message-from-ua-president-stuart-r-bell/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, the university’s president, Stuart R. Bell, confirmed that Mr. Badawi was a student there.</p><p>“I grieve alongside family and friends of Kareem in their heartbreaking loss,” Mr. Bell said.</p><p>Mr. Badawi’s father said that his favorite memories with his son were from when they traveled as a family. He had been to many states, including beaches in Florida, and the family had traveled to Mexico. Last year, the family took a trip to London.</p><p>“He was a lovely boy,” his father said, crying.</p><h3 id="link-68f2d77c"><span>Nicole Perez</span></h3><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nicole Perez</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elliott</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Nicole Perez, 27, was a devoted mother to her 4-year-old son, Melvin, and had recently been promoted to manager at the deli where she worked before she was killed in the attack.</p><p>Emily Elliott, 25, a close friend of Ms. Perez’s since high school, described her as a vital part of their tight-knit friend group.</p><p>“We were the kind of friends you told stories about to your kids hoping they’d find the same connections in their life,” she said.</p><p>Without planning it, the friends ended up having children just months apart. Their children referred to one another as siblings.</p><p>“She was the life of every room and every place she was in,” Ms. Elliott said. “You couldn’t be angry, sad or upset if she was around.”</p><p>Ms. Perez had been thrilled about her promotion and dreamed of owning a store one day, according to Kimberly Usher-Fall, the owner of the deli.</p><p>“She was so excited about the new position,” Ms. Usher-Fall <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/new-orleans-truck-attack-victim-great-mother-117255121?fbclid=IwY2xjawHjuhtleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHbgq5pvvWKqxitQ1XGHlZGF8Urjnl21NSAAovaT5hiin4H2L5p4d242a_A_aem_0QtEbXnqu3tv8g_NhY-RrA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> ABC News.</p><p>The sudden loss of Ms. Perez has devastated her family. Ms. Perez’s mother and sister were hospitalized for stress, Ms. Usher-Fall said.</p><h3 id="link-7c60250c"><span>Matthew Tenedorio</span></h3><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Matthew Tenedorio</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cathy Tenodorio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Matthew Tenedorio, 25, was known in his large extended family for his infectious laugh, easy manner and the love he lavished on his German shepherd, Brutus.</p><p>Not many knew that he also had a beautiful singing voice: “Just a secret that I was proud of, that I held in my heart,” his mother, Cathy Tenedorio, said in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Tenedorio had eaten dinner with his mother, father and one of his brothers in Slidell, La., just outside of New Orleans, before heading into New Orleans with friends, Ms. Tenedorio said.</p><p>Mr. Tenedorio was an audiovisual technician who worked as a contractor for the Superdome in New Orleans. He grew up in Slidell with two older brothers and a group of cousins who lived nearby. One cousin, Zack Colgan, 29, recalled endless hours spent playing with Nerf weapons, many minor injuries and getting in trouble for staying up late playing video games and overfilling the Tenedorios’ pool.</p><p>But as much as Mr. Tenedorio would roughhouse and joke around, Mr. Colgan said, he “would give the shirt off his back for you.” And when he told stories, Mr. Colgan said, he held everyone’s attention.</p><p>At the family’s boisterous parties, Mr. Colgan said, “Matthew stole the show.”</p><p>Mr. Tenedorio’s friends were separated from him in the chaos of the attack, the friends told his mother. They had seen people being shot. On Wednesday afternoon, a morgue confirmed Mr. Tenedorio’s death.</p><h3 id="link-46130863"><span>Ni’Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux</span></h3></div></div>
