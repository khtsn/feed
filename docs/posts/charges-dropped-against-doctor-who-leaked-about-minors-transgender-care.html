He requested access to the hospital’s record database in 2023, two years after he last worked there, claiming that he needed the information to provide “adult care services.”</p><p>The doctor took the health care information of children who had received transition-related services and disclosed that information to a conservative activist, Christopher Rufo. Mr. Rufo then published an article saying the hospital was continuing to provide transgender care to minors after it had announced an end to the practice.</p><p>Dr. Haim, 34, who has acknowledged disclosing the records, pleaded not guilty because he did not think he had done anything wrong, he said in a telephone interview on Saturday from his suburban Dallas home. He called himself a whistle-blower and said he had redacted the patients’ records to hide any identifiable information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prosecutors did not provide an explanation for dropping the charges, and Dr. Haim said he was relieved and surprised that they had done so. He said he had President Trump to thank for it, “100 percent.”</p><p>“He’s my man,” he said.</p><p>Texas Children’s Hospital said in an emailed statement that it would “defer to and respect” the prosecutors’ decision, which was announced Friday.</p><p>The dismissal of the charges was yet another assault on transgender rights, especially in Texas, said Johnathan Gooch, a spokesman for Equality Texas, an L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group.</p><p>Over the past few years, the state has enacted laws targeting transgender people, including one that bars transgender athletes from playing on girls’ and women’s sports teams from kindergarten through college. Those laws have had severe consequences for the trans community, advocacy groups say.</p><p>In states that enact anti-trans legislation, the rate of suicide attempts by transgender and nonbinary young people increases, according <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01979-5.epdf?sharing_token=EbX7LsH7-AF5n99850vpnNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PNveFlXHsicuqelg3jvg1Wcsju1CXHxspC9onbX6frEcU1-J5M25Ml5piLTNjBr959LGK7ejPr20VtTVSb18ArMlJnGNGgZYyU9CJQoJuUjN01H4VVGluDqO_epnWIg_A%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to a study</a> cited by Trevor Project, an L.G.B.T.Q. suicide prevention nonprofit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I think this whole incident with the exposure of private medical data seriously eroded a lot of trust between L.G.B.T.Q. people in Texas and their doctors, which is such an important relationship,” Mr. Gooch said. “I think it is alarming to see an implicit endorsement of anti-trans vigilantism from the Justice Department. If this is permissible, what else is permissible?”</p><p>In the first week of his new term, Mr. Trump has moved to dismantle many protections for transgender and other L.G.B.T.Q. people that were established under President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>Mr. Trump has ordered that government institutions recognize only the gender that a person was assigned at birth, and that it be either male or female. He instructed federal agencies to bar transgender women from “intimate single-sex spaces” like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/trump-transgender-inmates-prison.html" title="">prisons</a>.</p><p>An intense debate over whether to provide gender-transition treatment to minors is continuing across the country, including in states like Tennessee, which enacted a ban on the treatments that is now being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. Arguments in the case were heard in December.</p><p>In Texas, gender-transitioning care has been contentious for years. The state is one of at least 26 since 2021 to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/republicans-state-limits-transgender-identity.html" title="">enacted partial or total bans</a> on the treatments for minors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2023, the state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/us/texas-transgender-law.html" title="">prohibited</a> doctors from giving puberty blockers, hormone therapies or transition surgery to patients younger than 18. Doctors who violate that law risk losing their medical licenses, and health insurers are barred from covering the cost of the treatments.</p><p>The measure <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/texas-transgender-ban-minors.html" title="">was upheld</a> last year by the Texas Supreme Court. And in October, the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/texas-transgender-treatment-lawsuit.html#:~:text=Attorney%20General%20Ken%20Paxton%20of,action%20under%20the%20new%20law." title="">sued a Dallas pediatrician</a> whom he accused of providing gender-transition care to minors in violation of the law. The case is pending.</p><p>For Dr. Haim, the decision to leak private medical records to an activist who would publish the information was an easy one, he said, because he felt that the hospital and its doctors were harming children and that the public needed to know.</p><p>When Dr. Haim first heard that his colleagues at Texas Children’s Hospital were treating transgender children, gender-transition care was legal in the state. But in early 2022, Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state’s child protection agency to investigate youth transgender care as “child abuse,” and he said that anyone failing to report a case of a child being given that care would face criminal penalties.</p><p>Weeks later, to protect itself and its patients from legal claims, Texas Children’s Hospital announced that it would stop providing gender-transition care for minors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dr. Haim said he now was sure the Trump administration would bar the care nationally, so “the most radical surgeries finally will come to an end, and these people can get the help they need to live normal lives.” He said he believed that people who think they are transgender just need mental health care, and not puberty-blocking drugs or surgery.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics, however, says those treatments can be necessary to treat gender dysphoria, which is the psychological distress that can occur when a person’s body doesn’t match their gender identity. The organization has <a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/25340/AAP-reaffirms-gender-affirming-care-policy?autologincheck=redirected" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered a review of the</a> available data and research on transgender care, so that it can update its guidelines for the practice.</p><p>Genital surgery for adolescents is exceedingly rare, but top surgical procedures have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/health/top-surgery-transgender-teenagers.html" title="">more common</a> for older teenagers.</p><p>After Dr. Haim was indicted last summer, some Republican politicians took an interest in the case. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/eithan_haim_letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to Alamdar S. Hamdani, who was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Texas at the time, expressing concern that the case might be politically motivated.</p><p>Dr. Haim said he discussed the case last summer with Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, at a meeting of Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy group that has promoted anti-transgender legislation.</p><p>Regardless of the reason the charges against him were dropped, Dr. Haim called the development “a miracle.” If he had been convicted, he would have faced up to 10 years in prison.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Juliet Macur is a national reporter at The Times, based in Washington, D.C., who often writes about America through the lens of sports.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/juliet-macur">More about Juliet Macur</a></span></p></div><div><p>Amy Harmon covers how shifting conceptions of gender affect everyday life in the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amy-harmon">More about Amy Harmon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
