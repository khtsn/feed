He faces charges of bribery conspiracy, fraud and soliciting illegal campaign donations.</p><p>The mayor, a former Brooklyn borough president and police captain, is accused of accepting luxury travel for years before becoming the Democratic nominee for mayor and of pressuring the Fire Department to sign off on the opening of a new high-rise Turkish Consulate building in Midtown Manhattan after he was elected. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Prosecutors said that Mr. Adams accepted benefits worth more than $100,000 over nearly a decade, as well as illegal campaign contributions.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/2024-09-25-adams-annotated-indictment-index/2024-09-25-adams-annotated-indictment-index-articleLarge-v2.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Here Are the Charges Eric Adams Faces, Annotated</h2><p>The Times annotated the indictment.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Alex Spiro, one of Mr. Adams’s lawyers, has said that the charges are “not a real case.” New Yorkers will “see through this,” he said.</p><p>The hearing on Wednesday is scheduled to take place before Judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/nyregion/judge-ho-eric-adams.html" title="">Dale E. Ho</a>, who is assigned to the case, and is expected to be a largely procedural first step in which the judge is likely to set a schedule for both sides to file motions and may set tentative dates for a trial.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/nyregion/eric-adams-arraignment-bribery-fraud.html" title="">was arraigned</a> and was told that he could have no contact with any individual witness or others on a list prosecutors would provide concerning the “facts and circumstances” in the indictment. He will not be limited from communicating about business or private family matters, the judge ruled.</p><p>Since the arraignment, Mr. Adams’s lawyers have filed several motions before Judge Ho. On Monday, they asked the court to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/nyregion/adams-lawyer-indictment-defense.html" title="">dismiss a bribery charge</a> against the mayor. On Tuesday, his lawyers accused federal prosecutors of leaking information about the investigation that led to the mayor’s indictment and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/nyregion/eric-adams-prosecutors-leaks.html" title="">asked the judge to hold a hearing and issue sanctions</a> against them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Since the indictment, Mr. Adams has visited churches and held news conferences to shore up support. And he has said that he will not resign, even as calls for him to do so have grown.</p><p>Mr. Adams has said that the prosecutors’ allegations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-defense-conspiracy-theories-race.html" title="">are based on lies</a> and that the federal government has targeted him because he was critical of the Biden administration during the city’s migrant crisis.</p><p>“I always knew that if I stood my ground for New Yorkers that I would be a target — and a target I became,” he said in a video statement released the night that news of his indictment broke. “If I am charged, I am innocent, and I will fight this with every ounce of my strength and spirit.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index-articleLarge-v12.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Tracking Charges and Investigations in Eric Adams’s Orbit</h2><p>Four federal corruption inquiries have reached into the world of Mayor Eric Adams of New York.
