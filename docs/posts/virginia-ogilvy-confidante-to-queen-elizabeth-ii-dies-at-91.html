She was 91.</p><p>Her daughter Lady Elizabeth Baring confirmed the death.</p><p>Ladies-in-waiting, a position dating to the Middle Ages, carried out different tasks under different queens, including planning, correspondence and household administration.</p><p>But in all cases the most important task was to serve as a sort of official best friend, requiring discretion, an ear for gossip and a careful eye on the queen’s needs and wants. By tradition and necessity, the role is usually held by a peer, in part because it comes without salary or benefits.</p><p>Lady Ogilvy’s husband, David, the Earl of Airlie, had been friends with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/world/europe/queen-elizabeth-dead.html" title="">Queen Elizabeth</a> since they were children, and the couple were long a part of her social circle. Both would join her household: Lady Ogilvy in 1973 and her husband in 1984, taking the role of Lord Chamberlain of the Household, overseeing the queen’s domestic affairs after a long career in banking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Lady Ogilvy was something of a first among equals in the ranks of the ladies-in-waiting, with the official title of Lady of the Bedchamber. She and the queen were by all accounts quite close; the queen even joined Lady Ogilvy at her 70th birthday party, at Annabel’s, a members-only nightclub in London, an event celebrated in the British news media as the only time the queen went clubbing.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lady Ogilvy with her husband, David Ogilvy, at a state banquet in 1992.

She was attuned to a subtle sign language as the monarch mingled; if Elizabeth twisted her wedding ring, for example, it meant that she was tired of a conversation and needed to be extricated.</p><p>She frequently traveled with the queen, including on state visits to the United States. And she was always on hand when the queen received American visitors in Britain, including, in 2018, President Donald J. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>When Mr. Trump extended his hand to greet Lady Ogilvy, the 85-year-old countess grabbed it tightly and pulled him in close, visibly catching him off guard. <a href="https://x.com/sarahdiaryz/status/1825171355270037985" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A clip of the encounter</a> went viral in Britain.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lady Ogilvy with her husband-to-be in 1952, when they announced their engagement.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">ANL/Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Virginia Fortune Ryan was born on Feb. 9, 1933, in London while her American mother, Margaret (Kahn) Ryan, was in the city for a visit.</p><p>Both her parents came from immense wealth: Her maternal grandfather was <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/Otto-Hermann-Kahn" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Otto Kahn</a>, the financier said to be an inspiration for Rich Uncle Pennybags, a.k.a.

But they will not be replaced: Queen Camilla said that she would instead rely on a less formal group of “queen’s companions,” who would have fewer responsibilities than the ladies-in-waiting of her predecessors.</p></div></section></article></div>
