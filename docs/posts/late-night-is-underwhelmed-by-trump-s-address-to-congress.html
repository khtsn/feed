I guess they were waiting for that last coat of shellac to dry on his face.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Members of the Trump family were there: Eric was there, Lara, Don Jr., Jared, Ivanka, even Melania showed up. So Democrats weren’t the only people who hate him there.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Things got off to a big start when Trump and JD Vance held hands and sang a medley from ‘Wicked.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“He laid out his MAGA-genda for the next four years. They include wildly unpopular tariffs, abandoning our allies, buddying up to Russia, tax cuts for the rich and turning Gaza into Atlantic City — all the reasons blue-collar America voted for this man.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Trump said our momentum is back, our spirit is back, our pride is back. And not the gay kind, either: the regular pride.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“What he’s talking about, I have no idea. The stock market’s down, consumer confidence is down, the dollar is down. The only things that are high are egg prices and Elon Musk.” — <em>JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-3"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KADW3ZRZLVI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“In the end, Trump’s first address to Congress was much like his first six weeks: filled with useful lies, and applauded by useless idiots.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“He told our farmers to have a lot of fun and said the days of unelected bureaucrats are over, with Elon standing right there clapping like an imbecile. Yay for unelected bureaucrats.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“And the days of rule by unelected billionaires have just begun. Elon! Take a bow, Elon! You paid for it.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“It was quite a night. There were about 400 people in attendance — 300 were members of Congress, and 100 were Elon’s kids.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Yeah, the night was pretty much a welcome back party for Trump, Republicans and measles.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-e775586">The Punchiest Punchlines (Bad Neighbor Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Meanwhile, ahead of his address, Trump’s new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China went into effect, and they’re going to raise the price of everything from cars to electronics to clothes. It’s all part of Trump’s plan to make everything more expensive so eggs seem cheaper by comparison.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“And listen to this: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trump’s tariffs ‘very dumb,’ and he announced his own tariffs against the U.S. in retaliation. Do you know how bad things have to be for Canadians to do something mean?” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Yep, we’re in a big fight with our neighbor. Next, Trump’s going to go to the border and cut every tree branch that’s a tiny bit over the fence.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>On “After Midnight,” Taylor Tomlinson poked fun at Mark Zuckerberg for trying to replicate Benson Boone’s Grammy performance at his 40th birthday celebration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-1f978490">What We’re Excited About on Wednesday Night</h2><p>The musicians Julien Baker &amp; Torres will perform and sit for an interview on “The Daily Show.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Harper Lee’s short fiction, soon to be published as part of a collection called “The Land of Sweet Forever,” shows her experimenting with characters and themes that would later appear in “To Kill a Mockingbird.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ben Martin/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
