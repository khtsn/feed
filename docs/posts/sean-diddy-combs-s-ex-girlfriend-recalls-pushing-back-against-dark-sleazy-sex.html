I don’t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head. I don’t want to keep feeling like that anymore.”</p><p>Jane has testified that in an effort to fulfill her boyfriend’s fantasies, she began to participate in sexual encounters with a succession of hired men that the couple called “debauchery” or “hotel nights.” Her account of the sex marathons aligned with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html" title="">“freak-offs”</a> described by Casandra Ventura, another former girlfriend who testified at the start of the case.</p><p>The pattern of “hotel nights” left Jane feeling used, exhausted and at times sick, she testified. But Mr. Combs was dismissive when she voiced her reluctance, she said, and she continued out of a desire to please him. At times, she arranged to hire certain “entertainers” herself so she could choose the men involved, she testified.</p><p>The dynamic shifted in early 2023, when Mr. Combs began paying her $10,000-a-month rent. (On Friday, Jane said on the stand that Mr. Combs is still paying the rent for her home.)</p><p>After Jane complained to Mr. Combs in September about the hotel nights, he calmed her down on a FaceTime call, and she flew from Los Angeles to see him in New York with the understanding that they would be spending quality time together, not engaging in their typical “debauchery.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But when she was on the plane, Mr. Combs texted her that he had a “surprise” for her, making clear that he intended to have a hotel night, Jane testified. In New York, she said, she again voiced discomfort and Mr. Combs grew defensive, insisting that they did not have to go through with the plan.</p><p>But then, Jane testified, “We started riding back to the hotel and then he gives me a pill,” which turned out to be Ecstasy — a drug typically used during the sex marathons.</p><p>At the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan, the hotel night with the “surprise” male escort did not go well, Jane said, and she ended up flying in another man whom she was more accustomed to.</p><p>“I felt that I needed to make up for it,” Jane testified.</p><p>The prosecution then showed the jury text messages from the following month, when Jane continued to object to the pattern of what she called “loveless, cold sex.”</p><p>As Jane recalled feeling mistreated in the relationship and aggrieved seeing the romantic gestures Mr. Combs made to other girlfriends, the mogul, sitting in the courtroom between his lawyers, pushed back in his chair, shook his head sharply and rubbed his face with his hand.</p><p>“I’m not a porn star,” Jane said, reading aloud her text to him from October 2023. “I’m not an animal. I need a break.”</p><p>Olivia Bensimon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
