I need a break.”</p><p>Jane, who the prosecution has said is a victim of sex-trafficking by the music mogul, is on her third day of testimony about her tumultuous relationship with Mr. Combs, which started in 2021 and continued until his arrest in 2024.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At times, Mr. Combs responded to the texts by promising one-on-one time together; at others, he rejected her version of events or brought up the home where she lived with her son, for which he was paying the rent.</p><p>“I don’t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head,” Jane once wrote to him.</p><p>Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. His lawyers have denied that the sex at the center of the case was ever coercive, saying that Jane was a “capable, strong adult woman” who consented to the sexual encounters again and again.</p><p>As Jane recalled feeling mistreated in the relationship and aggrieved about seeing Mr. Combs’s romantic gestures to other girlfriends, the mogul, sitting in the courtroom between his lawyers, pushed back in his chair, shook his head sharply and rubbed his palm over his face.</p><p>Jane has testified that in an effort to fulfill her boyfriend’s fantasies, she began to participate in the encounters with a succession of hired men that the couple called “debauchery” or “hotel nights,” which typically involved Mr. Combs watching her have sex as he masturbated. Her account of the sex marathons aligned with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html" title="">“freak-offs”</a> described by Casandra Ventura, another former girlfriend who testified at the start of the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The repetitive “hotel nights” left Jane feeling used, exhausted and at times sick, she testified. But Mr. Combs was dismissive when she voiced her reluctance, she said, and she continued out of a desire to please him. At times, she arranged to hire certain “entertainers” herself so she could choose the men involved, she testified.</p><p>The dynamic shifted in early 2023, when Mr. Combs began paying her $10,000-a-month rent, creating a dynamic that prosecutors have framed as financial coercion. (On Friday, Jane said on the stand that Mr. Combs is still paying the rent for her home.)</p><p>The prosecution presented a narrative of their relationship through a series of lengthy, emotionally charged text message exchange, which Jane read aloud from the witness stand.</p><p>The texts in which Jane expressed an aversion to the sex nights were often followed by a reconciliation — and then a return to the same pattern.</p><p>After she complained to Mr. Combs in September 2023 about the hotel nights, Jane testified, he calmed her down on a FaceTime call, and she flew from Los Angeles to see him in New York with the understanding that they would be spending quality time together, not engaging in their typical “debauchery.”</p><p>But when she was on the plane, Mr. Combs texted her that he had a “surprise” for her, making clear that he intended to have a hotel night, Jane testified. In New York, she said, she again voiced discomfort and Mr. Combs grew defensive, insisting that they did not have to go through with the plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But then, Jane testified, “We started riding back to the hotel and then he gives me a pill,” which turned out to be Ecstasy — a drug typically used during those encounters.</p><p>At the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan, the hotel night with the “surprise” male escort did not go well, Jane said, and she ended up flying in another man whom she was more accustomed to.</p><p>“I felt that I needed to make up for it,” Jane testified.</p><p>In October of that year, Jane and Mr. Combs had an explosive series of communications in which she described herself as feeling sexually “violated” and he responded that she was threatening him. She told him that she felt he had been using the home he paid for as “leverage” for hotel nights, and he responded that she was “crazy” and wrote, “let’s just leave each other alone.”</p><p>At the time, Mr. Combs was riding a high after the release of his first solo studio album in 17 years. For his birthday in November 2023, Jane testified, she bought him a television that they could move around the room so they could watch pornography or old sex videos, in an effort to eliminate the need to invite hired men over.</p><p>Then, Ms. Ventura filed her lawsuit alleging years of physical and sexual abuse, which included accounts of meticulously directed sex with male prostitutes that mirrored Jane’s own experience.</p><p>“I almost fainted,” Jane testified. “In fact I think I did.”</p><p>After the lawsuit was filed, she texted Mr. Combs: “I feel like I’m reading my own sexual trauma. It makes me sick how three solid pages, word for word, is exactly my experiences and my anguish.”</p><p>Olivia Bensimon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
