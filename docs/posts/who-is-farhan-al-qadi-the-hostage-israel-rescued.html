    <h1>Who Is Farhan al-Qadi, the Hostage Israel Rescued?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Israeli military on Tuesday celebrated the rescue of Farhan al-Qadi, who was taken hostage during Hamas’s attacks on Oct. 7. The 52-year-old was hospitalized in stable medical condition.</p><p>Mr. al-Qadi, a member of Israel’s Bedouin Arab minority, is from Rahat, a city in southern Israel. He was working in a small Israeli kibbutz, called Magen, near the Gaza border, when he was abducted, according to a <a href="https://x.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/1828411641483907232" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> from President Isaac Herzog of Israel.</p><p>His brother, Khatem al-Qadi, told Israeli television that the family planned a huge party to celebrate his return. Calling for a cease-fire deal, he wished the same for other hostages still in captivity:<strong> </strong>“They are still waiting to see their loved ones back today,” he said. “We are wishing for all of the hostages to be released and for there to be a deal now.’’</p><p>For some, Mr. al-Qadi’s rescue was a reminder of the toll the attacks took on Israel’s impoverished Bedouin community. At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-arab-bedouins.html" title="">17 Bedouins died</a> in the Oct. 7 attacks. Many more who had worked on Jewish farms in southern Israel lost their livelihoods after the farms were ransacked.</p></div></div>
