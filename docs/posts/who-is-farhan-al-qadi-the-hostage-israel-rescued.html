The 52-year-old was hospitalized in stable medical condition.</p><p>Mr. al-Qadi, a member of Israel’s Bedouin Arab minority, is from Rahat, a city in southern Israel. He was working in a small Israeli kibbutz, called Magen, near the Gaza border, when he was abducted, according to a <a href="https://x.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/1828411641483907232" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> from President Isaac Herzog of Israel.</p><p>His brother, Khatem al-Qadi, told Israeli television that the family planned a huge party to celebrate his return. Calling for a cease-fire deal, he wished the same for other hostages still in captivity:<strong> </strong>“They are still waiting to see their loved ones back today,” he said. “We are wishing for all of the hostages to be released and for there to be a deal now.’’</p><p>For some, Mr. al-Qadi’s rescue was a reminder of the toll the attacks took on Israel’s impoverished Bedouin community. At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-arab-bedouins.html" title="">17 Bedouins died</a> in the Oct. 7 attacks. Many more who had worked on Jewish farms in southern Israel lost their livelihoods after the farms were ransacked.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Even before the attacks, the Bedouins were suffering. Few have access to bomb shelters and health clinics because they live in villages that the Israeli government does not recognize. Even though Hamas does not specifically target them, Bedouins are not always able to seek shelter when the group fires rockets into southern Israel.</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel-Hezbollah Tensions:</strong> Amid fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the two sides mounted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-hamas-gaza-iran.html">biggest round of cross-border strikes</a> since the war in Gaza began.
