According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, about one in 36 American children now has a diagnosis of autism, compared with one in 150 in 2000. Experts attribute the rise to greater awareness and improvements in identification of children who exhibit a variety of symptoms classified together as “autism spectrum disorder.”</p><p>The theory that vaccines cause autism gained currency in 1998, after a British researcher published a medical journal article that purported to find a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism. That article has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/03lancet.html" title="">since been retracted</a>, and its author has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/health/policy/25autism.html" title="">stripped of his medical license.</a></p><p>Studies have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090379821002312" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeatedly demonstrated</a> that there is no link, including a <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13164/adverse-effects-of-vaccines-evidence-and-causality" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2012 vaccine safety review by the Institute of Medicine</a>, now known as the National Academy of Medicine, that stated, “the M.M.R. vaccine is not associated with autism.” A <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2101" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national study</a> in Denmark in 2019 came to the same conclusion. Yet as recently as August, <a href="https://reason.com/2024/08/28/john-stossel-fact-checks-rfk-jr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview with the libertarian commentator John Stossel</a>, Mr. Kennedy asserted, “autism is caused by vaccines.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sheryl Gay Stolberg covers health policy for The Times from Washington.
