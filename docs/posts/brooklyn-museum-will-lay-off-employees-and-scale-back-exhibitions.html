They will be the institution’s first major cuts since 2020, when it laid off <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/574854/brooklyn-museum-new-museum-layoffs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 30 workers</a> at the start of the pandemic.</p><p>Union leaders representing employees at the Brooklyn Museum said that they were concerned with the timing of these new cuts, which follow a series of expensive events and exhibitions celebrating the museum’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/arts/design/brooklyn-museum-200-art-collection.html" title="">200th anniversary</a>, including a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2024/10/12/brooklyn-museum-cafe-office-of-tangible-space/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">renovated restaurant</a>, an exhibition <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/solid-gold?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA2JG9BhAuEiwAH_zf3qVwR_0O8QuvUQ7bJjnAVDARC4aehlfogqdtKUz3ptWBkT1AnFLdXBoCxQ0QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">devoted to gold</a> and a <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/stories/new-brand" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rebranding campaign</a>.</p><p>“We are dismayed that the museum would choose to balance the budget on the backs of union members,” said Wilson Souffrant, president of Local 1502, a division of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.</p><p>On Wednesday, the union sent a cease-and-desist letter to the museum to try to prevent officials from laying off the employees it represents without sufficient negotiations or advance notice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The crowd at the opening night party for “Giants: Art from the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys”, an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In recent years, the Brooklyn Museum has attempted to rebuild its audience after the pandemic led to a drop in attendance. (General admission is free, though the museum recommends a suggested contribution of $20 for adult visitors.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last year included exhibitions devoted to celebrities like the filmmaker <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/spike_lee" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spike Lee</a> and the musician <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/paul-mccartney" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paul McCartney</a>; it also staged a show featuring the art collection of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/arts/design/alicia-keys-swizz-beatzs-art-brooklyn-museum.html" title="">Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz</a>.</p><p>In the letter, Pasternak said that the museum’s exhibitions had attracted audiences and that the institution had almost doubled its board, increased its endowment and both its contributed and earned revenues. But expenses were still outstripping revenues. During a staff meeting on Friday, the museum said that its total compensation for employees had risen by $17 million in the last 10 years.</p><p>The museum also became a target of activists after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/nyregion/brooklyn-museum-protests.html" title="">34 people were arrested</a> at a pro-Palestinian rally held on its grounds last spring. Protesters had assaulted security staff and damaged artwork while calling for officials to divest from Israel. A group of demonstrators were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/brooklyn-museum-hate-crimes-charged.html" title="">later arrested</a> on hate crime charges for vandalizing the homes of Pasternak and other museum leaders.</p><p>In its letter announcing the layoffs, the museum said it was still on track to begin its 2026 renovation project for its Arts of Africa collection.</p><p>But Pasternak and other leaders wrote that layoffs had become unavoidable: “Wages comprise our largest operational line item — approximately 70% of our operating budget — and a financial realignment sadly requires reductions in our team.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zachary Small is a Times reporter writing about the art world’s relationship to money, politics and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zachary-small">More about Zachary Small</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
