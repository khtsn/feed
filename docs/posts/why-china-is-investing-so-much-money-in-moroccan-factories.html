Last year, the Biden administration effectively blocked Chinese E.V.s by putting a 100 percent tariff on them, and the European Union increased its tariffs on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/europe-china-electric-vehicles-tariffs.html" title="">Chinese electric vehicles</a> to as much as 45 percent.</p><p>These types of trade sand traps have been a boon for countries like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/business/china-mexico-tariffs-trump.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Mexico, Vietnam, Thailand,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/business/malaysia-semiconductors.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Malaysia,</a> India, Indonesia, Turkey and Morocco, allowing companies to sidestep import duties.

Mr. Trump recognized <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-morocco-trump.html" title="">Moroccan sovereignty</a> over the region in 2020 in exchange for Morocco’s normalizing relations with Israel, and the government would not want to do anything to endanger that.</p><p>Morocco has had a <a href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/morocco-fta/final-text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">free-trade agreement</a> with the United States for two decades. Mr. Trump has, nonetheless, subjected it to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/economy/trump-tariffs-global-economy.html" title="">10 percent across-the-board tariff</a> that he imposed on virtually all imports.
