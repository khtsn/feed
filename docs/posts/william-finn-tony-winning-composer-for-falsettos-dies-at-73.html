He was 73.</p><p>His longtime partner, Arthur Salvadore, said the cause of death, in a hospital, was pulmonary fibrosis, following years in which Mr. Finn had contended with neurological issues. He had homes in Williamstown, Mass., and on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</p><p>Mr. Finn was widely admired for his clever, complex lyrics and for the poignant honesty with which he explored character. He was gay and Jewish, and some of his most significant work concerned those communities; in the 1990s, with “Falsettos,” he was among the first artists to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/theater/falsettos-memory.html?smid=url-share" title="">musicalize the tragedy</a> of the AIDS epidemic, and his musical “A New Brain” was inspired by his own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/magazine/the-long-running-musical-of-william-finn-s-life.html" title="">life-threatening experience</a> with an arteriovenous malformation.</p><p>“In the pantheon of great composer-lyricists, Bill was idiosyncratically himself — there was nobody who sounded like him,” said André Bishop, the producing artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater. He presented seven of Mr. Finn’s shows, starting at Playwrights Horizons in the late 1970s and continuing at Lincoln Center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“He became known as this witty wordsmith who wrote lots of complicated songs dealing with things people didn’t deal with in song in those days,” Mr. Bishop added, “but what he really had was this huge heart — his shows are popular because his talent was beautiful and accessible and warm and heartfelt.”</p><p>Mr. Finn played varying roles across his career, as a composer, a lyricist and sometime librettist. His songs often feature “a wordy introspective urbanity,” as Stephen Holden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/28/movies/theater-review-departed-friends-vibrantly-recalled-in-song.html" title="">wrote</a> in The New York Times in 2003. In “A New Brain,” Mr. Finn seemed to distill his passion for the art form, writing, “Heart and music keep us all alive.”</p><p>“The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,” for which Mr. Finn wrote the music and lyrics, arrived on Broadway in 2005 (the cast included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jesse-tyler-ferguson" title="">Jesse Tyler Ferguson</a>), directed by James Lapine, a frequent collaborator with Mr. Finn. The show, about a group of awkward adolescents competing in a spelling bee, ran for nearly three years on Broadway and has been wildly successful: Over the last 16 years, it has been produced more than 7,000 times in professional, community and school settings, according to Drew Cohen, the president and chief executive of Music Theater International, which licenses it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jesse Tyler Ferguson, foreground, in 2005 in Mr. Finn’s popular musical “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,” at the Circle in the Square Theater in Manhattan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Finn loved the Berkshires in Western Massachusetts and had a long relationship with the Barrington Stage Company in Pittsfield, Mass., which presented the premier of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” in a high school cafeteria in the summer of 2004.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Finn, who for years had a home in Pittsfield, went on to establish <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2016/08/18/william-finn-lab-musicals-under-microscope/Yzsorb3wcMmVyVAuHnEvCN/story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a musical theater lab</a> at Barrington Stage to develop and present work by young writers. He remained an associate artist at Barrington Stage until his death, and in 2023 the theater presented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/theater/review-new-brain-william-finn.html?smid=url-share" title="">a well-received revival</a> of “A New Brain.”</p><p>“Bill was brilliant, quirky, compassionate and very funny, and he understood the truth of people — the true emotions that led them to do what they were doing,” said Julianne Boyd, the former artistic director of Barrington Stage. Ms. Boyd, who for years lived across the street from Mr. Finn in Pittsfield, said he had notably been committed to developing young writers as a teacher, as the founder of the musical theater lab and for years as the host of a Labor Day weekend celebration of “songs by ridiculously talented composers and lyricists you probably don’t know but should.”</p><p>Mr. Finn also had a long affiliation with New York University, where he was an adjunct assistant professor in the graduate musical theater writing program from 1999 to 2019.</p><p>Even as he slowed down in recent years, he continued to work. He had been developing a song cycle about the pandemic, called “Once Every Hundred Years,” Mr. Salvadore said.</p><p>William Alan Finn was born on Feb. 28, 1952, in Boston and raised in suburban Natick, Mass. His father, Jason Finn, worked for a paper products company; his mother, Barbara (Cohen) Finn, had a variety of jobs and at one point owned a consignment store.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A lifelong theater lover, Mr. Finn claimed to have written his first play as a Hebrew School project. “I have no idea what it was about,” he <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/the-man-behind-broadways-big-jewish-musical" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Tablet</a>. “But it was horrible, I guarantee it. I couldn’t write plays, and I couldn’t really speak Hebrew, so how good could it be?”</p><p>He attended Natick High School and then Williams College in Williamstown, where he wrote three musicals. He <a href="https://alumni.williams.edu/200/you-are-now-leaving-williamstown/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">graduated from Williams</a> in 1974 with majors in English and American civilization. The college gave him its <a href="https://alumni-awards.williams.edu/listings/?fwp_search=finn&amp;fwp_medals_awards=bicentennial-medal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bicentennial Medal</a> for achievement in 1998, an honorary degree in 2006, and its <a href="https://alumni-awards.williams.edu/listings/?fwp_search=finn&amp;fwp_medals_awards=kellogg-award" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kellogg Award</a> in 2009; and last year, at his 50th college reunion, his final song cycle was performed there.</p><p>After graduating from Williams and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-04-26-ca-50580-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a brief detour to California</a>, he moved to New York, where over several years he wrote a trio of musicals about a character named Marvin who leaves his wife for a man and ultimately reconciles with both his sexuality and his family: “In Trousers” (1979), “March of the Falsettos” (1981) and “Falsettoland” (1990). All three were staged at Playwrights Horizons.</p><p>“In Trousers” was panned by Richard Eder of The Times (“A bare germ of an idea,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/17/archives/in-trousers-is-fantasies-of-a-boy-14.html?smid=url-share" title="">he wrote</a>), but “March of the Falsettos” scored a rave from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/10/arts/stage-march-of-falsettos-a-musical-find.html?smid=url-share" title="">the newspaper’s Frank Rich</a> (“The show is only a few bars old before one feels the unmistakable, revivifying charge of pure talent”), and Mr. Finn was on his way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Finn in 1992 outside the John Golden Theater on Broadway, where his musical “Falsettos” was being presented.

The show won two Tony Awards, for Mr. Finn’s scores and for its book, which Mr. Finn wrote with Mr. Lapine. The show was revised and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/theater/falsettos-broadway.html?smid=url-share" title="">revived</a> on Broadway in 2016 (“Exhilarating, devastating,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/theater/falsettos-review.html?smid=url-share" title="">wrote</a> Charles Isherwood of The Times), and it has been periodically performed elsewhere.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Finn’s “A New Brain” was staged at the Mitzi E.
