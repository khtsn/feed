</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Under the cease-fire, Hezbollah must also pull out from southern Lebanon and the Lebanese military is supposed to deploy there. Israeli officials have accused both Hezbollah and the Lebanese army of not upholding the agreement. The Lebanese military has said it can only fully deploy in the south once Israel’s military has withdrawn.</p><p>A U.S.-led monitoring committee overseeing the truce has praised the Lebanese military’s deployment but has not released data on the extent to which Hezbollah has withdrawn its weapons and fighters.</p><p>The latest conflict began after the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023, when Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese armed group allied with Hamas, began firing rockets on Israeli positions. Israel and Hezbollah then exchanged cross-border fire for months, until the conflict <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/middleeast/lebanon-diaspora-israel-hezbollah-war.html" title="">escalated into an intense war</a> that forced over a million people from their homes.</p><p>For months, thousands of displaced Lebanese have been unable to return to areas controlled by Israel amid repeated warnings by the Israeli military to stay away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The United Nations, which has long maintained a peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, said on Tuesday that Israel had pulled out of population centers in the south. But the organization said the continued Israeli presence in the country violated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/middleeast/un-resolution-1701-explained.html" title="">a U.N. resolution which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war</a> and formed the basis of the recent cease-fire.</p><p>The resolution, agreed to by Israel and Lebanon, also required Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters from the south.</p><p>The delay was “not what we hoped would happen,” the U.N. Lebanon envoy and the U.N. peacekeeping force in the region said in a joint statement.</p><p>Displaced residents flocked south on Tuesday despite the continued Israeli presence, some arriving home to find their towns and villages almost unrecognizable. At least two people were injured by Israeli gunfire, according to Lebanon’s state-run news agency.</p><p>“Our memories are destroyed, and our homes,” said Yara Awada, 24, who entered Houla, a southern border town, on Tuesday for the first time in more than a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Most of Ms. Awada’s neighborhood is now in ruins, with her family home toppled to the ground. Her grandfather had built the house with his bare hands more than 100 years ago, she said.</p><p>“This house meant a lot to my family. Ten children grew up in this house with their cousins and relatives. Then suddenly, within seconds, everything was gone,” Ms. Awada said. “It hurts our heart to see our village like this. But we still have hope and we are going to rebuild our village better than it was.”</p><p>Ali Qassem, the mayor of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/world/middleeast/lebanon-destruction.html" title="">hard-hit</a> southern Lebanese border town of Yaroun, estimated that more than 80 percent of the town had been destroyed — including homes, churches and mosques. He said the Lebanese army, which had left during Israel’s ground invasion in October, had deployed into the town early on Tuesday.</p><p>“My house here was totally destroyed,” said the mayor, adding that he still remained displaced.</p><p>Last month, Israeli forces killed more than two dozen people as they tried to enter southern border towns, according to Lebanese officials. The Israeli military said it had fired “warning shots in order to eliminate threats.”</p><p>Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, vehemently opposed Israel’s intention to remain in parts of southern Lebanon. But in a speech on Sunday, he stopped short of threatening to resume attacks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Israel must withdraw completely on Feb. 18,” Mr. Qassem said. “This is the agreement,” he added. “Everyone knows how an occupation is dealt with.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Israeli military sign at the Israel-Lebanon border, with the Lebanese village of Blida in the background. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jalaa Marey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Despite their objections, Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have no real ability to compel Israel to withdraw. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/middleeast/lebanon-politics-president-parliament-vote.html" title="">Lebanon’s leaders</a> have sought to rally their Arab neighbors and appeal to the United States in bids to pressure Israel.</p><p>But experts say that Hezbollah, weakened by 14 months of conflict with Israel, is unlikely to risk renewing the conflict in the near term.</p><p>However, if Israel does remain indefinitely inside Lebanon, this could strengthen Hezbollah, regional experts said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“If Israel stays in those five points, that is absolutely a gift to Hezbollah,” Paul Salem, the vice president for international engagement at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said. “It enables them to say the occupation cannot be ended by diplomacy, and hence that Lebanon continues to need armed resistance.”</p><p>Lebanon’s new president, Joseph Aoun, has pledged to bring all arms under the state’s control, a challenge to Hezbollah, which has long wielded inordinate influence over the country. But it is unclear how or whether Mr. Aoun can accomplish this.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed houses in the town of Khiam, southern Lebanon, on Monday.
