Miller Jr., a vice president at the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees who oversees film and television production for the union, said that over the two-year period from 2022 to 2024, roughly 18,000 full-time jobs had evaporated. One <a href="https://prodpro.com/blog/2025-tv-film-outlook-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent survey</a> of more than over 700 crew members found that almost two in three reported that their income fell short of expectations last year.</p><p>The new report found that the entertainment sector added almost 15,000 jobs last year, but that the gains were not enough to make up for all the jobs lost during the strikes.</p><p>The findings add to a growing body of evidence pointing to a crisis for Hollywood’s work force. Experts and industry workers alike say that some combination of the pandemic, the strikes and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/business/media/peak-tv-shows-2023-decline.html" title="">the end of peak streaming</a> have created an untenable situation for the workers who make up Hollywood’s middle class.</p><p>With such little work to go around over the last two years, writers, artists, set designers, camera operators and the many other people who power the industry have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/arts/television/price-is-right-emily-winter.html" title="">found side gigs</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/arts/maxed-out-on-la-he-chased-his-hollywood-dream-to-albuquerque.html" title="">left Los Angeles entirely</a>. Some who have been without work for many months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/movies/los-angeles-wildfires-hollywood-production.html" title="">lost their homes</a> in the wildfires that ripped through parts of Los Angeles in January.</p><p>Hollywood also faces stiff competition from other states and other countries that try to lure production away from California with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/arts/states-hollywood-film-tax-incentives.html" title="">generous tax incentives</a>. Several <a href="https://www.stayinla.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coalitions</a> were formed after the fires to try to keep more productions — and jobs — in Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has pushed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/movies/california-governor-newsom-film-tax-credits.html" title="">more than double California’s film and TV tax incentive program</a>.
