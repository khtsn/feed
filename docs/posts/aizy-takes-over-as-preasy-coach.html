They face the prospect that after being granted temporary permission to live in the United States, they will now be abruptly expelled and perhaps sent back to their perilous homelands.</p><p>“One court said one thing, another court said another, and that just leaves us all very confused and worried,” said Frantzdy Jerome, a Haitian who lives with his partner and their toddler in Ohio.</p><p>Immigration lawyers reported that they had been fielding calls from families asking whether they should continue to go to work or school. Their clients, they say, were given permission to live and work temporarily in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Now, with that permission revoked while legal challenges work their way through lower courts, many immigrants fear that any encounter with the police or other government agencies could lead to deportation, according to lawyers and community leaders.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Sometimes I have thought of going to Canada, but I don’t have family there to receive me,” said Frantzdy Jerome, who came to the United States from Haiti and lives in Ohio.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Guerline Jozef, executive director of the immigrant rights nonprofit Haitian Bridge Alliance, said some Afghan, Haitian and Ukrainian families were already planning to migrate north to Canada, as about 30,000 Haitian families had done in 2017 during the first Trump administration.</p><p>Ms. Jozef said thousands of Haitians who had followed the protocol set by the U.S. government for humanitarian parole felt blindsided by the Supreme Court decision. “They feel they can no longer survive in the United States, she said.”</p><p>The court on Friday allowed the Trump administration to revoke temporary legal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/23/us/biden-immigration-humanitarian-parole.html" title="">status granted during the Biden administration</a> to more than 530,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision was a response to an emergency request by the Department of Homeland Security, effectively killing a program that had granted humanitarian parole to nationals from those four countries. Beneficiaries were able to fly directly to the United States and remain for two years if they had passed background checks and secured a U.S. sponsor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The largest number of recipients are from Haiti, with 213,140, and Venezuela, with 120,760, according to official data. But how many of the parole recipients would be immediately vulnerable to deportation is difficult to know because some have applied for other legal pathways or deportation protections.</p><p>Last week, a federal judge in Boston blocked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/judge-blocks-shutdown-migrant-entry-programs.html" title="">Trump officials from pausing renewal</a> of applications for many of those programs. An unknown number of migrants have also applied for asylum or for what is known as Temporary Protected Status. While a Supreme Court decision earlier this month revoked that protection for an estimated 350,000 Venezuelans, it is still valid for Haitians until Aug. 3.</p><p>And the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/supreme-court-alien-enemies-act-deportations.html" title="">Supreme Court’s ruling that the government could not summarily deport people,</a> as the Trump administration did in the case of more than a hundred people sent to El Salvador, has effectively mandated a measure of due process for people facing deportation.</p><p>“No one can be put on a plane immediately,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “People may have ongoing court cases or pending applications for relief, such as asylum.”</p><p>Still, in Austin, Texas, Kate Lincoln Goldfinch, an immigration lawyer, said she had been advising her clients for months to apply for multiple forms of protection. “My concern is ICE is going to be moving to remove all of these people as quickly as possible without due process,” she said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Extra protection wasn’t enough for Belen, 47, a teacher from Venezuela. She arrived in the United States in late 2022, one of the early beneficiaries of the Biden humanitarian parole program. The following year, she applied for Temporary Protected Status, after President Biden declared that conditions in her home country made it risky for nationals to return. She thought T.P.S. would give her an extra layer of security until her partner’s asylum application was approved and he could sponsor her for a green card.</p><p>But the Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration’s decision to revoke T.P.S. for Venezuelans. And on Friday, the court allowed the administration to revoke humanitarian parole for Venezuelans and others.</p><p>“I never thought it would come to this,” said Belen, who spoke on the condition that she not be identified by name because she is concerned about being targeted by immigration enforcement officials. Belen, who works as a special-education teacher, said she was planning to meet with a lawyer to figure out her next steps. “If there is no solution, I will return to my country because I don’t want to remain here illegally.”</p><p>For Mr. Jerome, the end of protections for many Haitians could upend not only his community in Ohio but the lives of many people in Haiti who depend on relatives in the United States for support.</p><p>He works nights at an Amazon distribution center, and his partner, Muriel, works days. While they have both filed asylum applications recently, their fate remained unclear, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“If my work permit is cut off, how will I send money to my father and family?” Mr. Jerome said on Friday.</p><p>“Sometimes I have thought of going to Canada, but I don’t have family there to receive me,” he said. “I have only distant cousins.”</p><p>Mr. Jerome said that he had also heard that people who tried to cross the northern border were being detained. Only those with documents attesting to close kin living there were allowed to enter.</p><p>In New York, Sandra Sayago is a co-owner of El Budare Café along a stretch of Roosevelt Avenue in Queens that has turned into a hub for Venezuelans who have arrived in the country in recent years.</p><p>“I think most Venezuelans are wondering day by day about what will happen,” Ms. Sayago said, expressing frustration over the nation’s rapidly shifting immigration policies. She added, “We’re in limbo.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The end of the parole program is likely to ripple through the U.S. economy as employers are forced to let its beneficiaries go.</p><p>”This will have a massive impact on businesses,” said Jennie Murray, president of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy organization.</p><p>“It will be a huge destabilizing moment for the economy,” she said.</p><p>A large senior living provider in Northern Virginia, Goodwin Living, has 65 workers with some form of temporary status that allows them to live and work in the United States.</p><p>Among the 13 Haitians employed there, four are vulnerable following Friday’s court decision, according to Lindsay Hutter, chief strategy and marketing officer.</p><p>“It gives us heartache that these team members contributing to our economy, supporting the residents of our senior living communities and contributing to the fabric of our society in Virginia are now at risk of returning to an environment that is precarious and dangerous,” she said.</p><p>Ana Ley<!-- --> and <!-- -->Luis Ferré-Sadurní<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Miriam Jordan reports from a grass roots perspective on immigrants and their impact on the demographics, society and economy of the United States.</p></div><div><p>Jazmine Ulloa is a national reporter covering immigration for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Top Officials Leave ICE:</strong> Kenneth Genalo, the top ICE deportation official, is retiring, and two other officials are moving on to different roles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/ice-deportations-officials-trump.html">the Department of Homeland Security announced.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Workers Haunted by Deportations</strong>: Foreign-born workers on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/nyregion/immigrants-farms-deportations-trump.html">New York&#39;s fruit and dairy farms have sequestered themselves</a> to avoid the administration&#39;s deportation net.</p></li><li><p><strong>JD Vance&#39;s Campaign Plane</strong>: The Boeing 737 has been chartered more than a dozen times this year by the federal government to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/jd-vance-plane-deportation-flights.html">deport migrants to several countries in Central America.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>A Library on the Border</strong>: A wealthy widow built a library and opera house on the border between Quebec and Vermont, a symbol of binational friendship. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/canada/haskell-free-library-opera-house-quebec-vermont-border.html">Now U.S. officials are restricting access to Canadians.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>White South Africans:</strong> Thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/africa/south-africa-trump-afrikaners-refugees.html">Afrikaners are jockeying to get on the next flight to the United States as refugees.</a> They say the backlash against their community is unfair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Carol&#39;s Detention:</strong> For 20 years, Carol Hui has served waffles, raised her children and embraced the small town of Kennett, Mo. Her detention and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/missouri-immigrant-trump.html">pending deportation to Hong Kong has hit the community hard,</a> in a county that voted overwhelmingly for Trump.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russian Scientist Case:</strong> A federal judge said she would grant bail to Kseniia Petrova, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/science/russian-scientist-harvard-charges.html">an immigration case stemming from Petrova’s failure to declare scientific samples</a> she was carrying into the country.</p></li><li><p><strong>Checks on Migrant Children:</strong> From New York to Hawaii, federal agents have been showing up unannounced at schools, homes and migrant shelters to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/trump-ice-migrant-children-welfare-checks.html">interview minors in what the government calls “wellness checks.”</a></p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
