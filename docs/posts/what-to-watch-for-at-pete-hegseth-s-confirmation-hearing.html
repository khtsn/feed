Trump’s choice for defense secretary, will face a stream of questions on Tuesday from members of a Senate committee that is considering his expected nomination.</p><p>It could be a contentious hearing. Mr. Hegseth has faced scrutiny because of accusations of excessive drinking and an allegation of sexual assault.</p><p>He has also faced criticism for comments about limiting the role of women in the military.</p><p>Here is what to watch for as the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing gets underway:</p><h2 id="link-7f45807f">Questions related to his alcohol use</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth will almost surely be asked about his alcohol use. The New York Times and other news media organizations have documented a history of excessive drinking, including some episodes that Mr. Hegseth himself has described. He has vowed that if he is confirmed, there “won’t be a drop of alcohol on my lips.” Will that be sufficient for the senators on the committee?</p><h2 id="link-39aed8de">Sexual assault allegation</h2><p>How will Mr. Hegseth address concerns about a 2017 police investigation into whether he raped a woman after a speaking event in Monterey, Calif.? He has said that the sexual encounter was consensual and that he agreed to pay the woman a secret financial settlement only to protect his job. No criminal charges were filed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-480f61be">Managerial experience</h2><p>Other defense secretaries in recent history have had vastly greater managerial experience than Mr. Hegseth, a former “Fox &amp; Friends” weekend anchor. His successive tenures as head of two small veterans groups from 2008 to 2016 ended with both in financial trouble. How will he answer questions about his ability to lead the Pentagon, an $849 billion enterprise with nearly three million employees?</p><h2 id="link-6cf86e62">Views on diversity</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth has complained about “woke” generals who he said left the military “effeminate” by supporting diversity policies that were pushing away “America’s white sons and daughters.”</p><h2 id="link-28afffa0">Women in combat</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth has also said that “we should not have women in combat roles.” He now says that women can serve if they meet the right standard. What will he say about whether he would turn back the clock in the military?</p><h2 id="link-ec41e51">International policies, including the war in Ukraine</h2><p>Lawmakers are also likely to ask Mr. Hegseth about major international policy issues. He has voiced skepticism about continuing to provide military aid to Ukraine. Is that still his view?</p><p>Given Iran’s weakened state, should the United States, perhaps acting with Israel, carry out military strikes against Iran’s nuclear program?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>What additional steps does the U.S. military need to take to counter the rising military threat from China?</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon LaFraniere is an investigative reporter currently focusing on Republican candidates in the 2024 presidential election.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-lafraniere">More about Sharon LaFraniere</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Inside DOGE:</strong> Elon Musk, one of the co-leaders of President-elect Donald Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-government-trump.html">recruiting billionaires, tech executives and others</a> to take up unofficial positions across the federal government.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shedding Assets:</strong> Scott Bessent, the billionaire hedge fund manager whom Trump tapped to be his Treasury secretary, plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/business/scott-bessent-treasury-divest.html">divest from dozens of funds, trust and investments</a> in preparation to become the nation’s top economic policymaker.</p></li><li><p><strong>Building a Case:</strong> Trump is likely to justify his plans to seal off the border with Mexico by citing a public health emergency. Now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/politics/trump-title-42-migrants.html">he just has to find one</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Controversial Decision:</strong> When floods ravaged her state, Gov. Kristi Noem <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/noem-south-dakota-flood-homeland-security.html">chose not to send the National Guard</a>. But her decision to deploy troops to the border was one reason she was picked by Trump to lead the Homeland Security Department.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blurring the Lines:</strong> The scale of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/trump-hussain-sajwani-damac-crypto-deals.html">overlap between Trump family businesses and the federal government</a> underscores how unprecedented the second Trump presidency and the potential for conflicts of interest will be.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
