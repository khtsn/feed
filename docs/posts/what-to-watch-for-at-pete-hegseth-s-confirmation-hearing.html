Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-trump.html" title="">pick to lead the Pentagon</a>, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday for a confirmation hearing where he may face questions over a sexual assault allegation, a lack of management experience and comments against women serving in combat.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, has a host of comments and allegations to explain, as Democratic lawmakers get a chance to ask him publicly about his qualifications to lead the Defense Department, which has nearly three million employees and an $849 billion budget.</p><div><p>One key participant is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/us/politics/ernst-hegseth-defense-trump.html" title="">Senator Joni Ernst</a>, Republican of Iowa, who has said that Mr. Hegseth needed to address issues including the role of women in the military and sexual assault prevention, comments that drew criticism from Trump supporters. The support of Ms. Ernst — a veteran of the Army Reserve and National Guard, and a sexual assault survivor — is seen as critical to Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation chances.</p><p>It remains unclear whether he has the votes to be confirmed. After the committee hearing, the full Senate must vote on the confirmation. If all Senate Democrats oppose him, he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans in the chamber.</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Accusations:</strong> The New York Times and other news organizations have documented <a href="#pete-hegseth-drinking-alcohol" title="">a pattern of excessive drinking</a> by Mr. Hegseth. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/police-report-sexual-assault-claim-hegseth.html" title="">the most serious allegation</a> against him, a woman in Monterey, Calif., accused him of raping her in 2017. Mr. Hegseth said the encounter was consensual, and it resulted in no criminal charges. His lawyer said Mr. Hegseth was inebriated at the time.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Background check:</strong> The top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/politics/fbi-briefing-hegseth-senators.html" title="">briefed late Friday</a> on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/fbi-pete-hegseth-background-check.html" title="">F.B.I.’s background check</a> of Mr. Hegseth. Others suggested that they might not have all the information they need about him. Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, has said she wants to see the F.B.I. background check and Mr. Hegseth’s financial disclosures, and wants to know about “any other allegations he might be facing.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Leadership questions: </strong>Mr. Hegseth, who has been married three times, has also acknowledged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/pete-hegseth-mother-email.html" title="">having extramarital affairs</a>. Extramarital affairs and public intoxication can leave officers and troops in the military subject to disciplinary action. Some senior military leaders have questioned privately whether Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation could send conflicting messages to troops about discipline.</p></li><li><p><strong>Past commentary:</strong> Mr. Hegseth’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/politics/pete-hegseth-trump-confirmation.html" title="">commentary and writings</a> on a number of issues are also likely to come up. In his book “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,” Mr. Hegseth complained about “woke” generals who he said had made the military “effeminate” by pushing diversity policies.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Women’s roles:</strong> Before Mr. Trump picked him, Mr. Hegseth had said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/senate-republicans-women-hegseth.html" title="">he did not believe women should be in combat</a>. He has since offered some clarification. “If we have the right standard and women meet that standard, roger — let’s go,” he said on “The Megyn Kelly Show” podcast. “If they can’t, and that’s a product of physical differences because the standard is high, then that’s just the reality.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Waiver to serve:</strong> A former Army major who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a member of the National Guard until 2021, Mr. Hegseth would presumably need the congressional waiver that is required for any Pentagon chief who has been retired from active-duty military service less than seven years.</p></li></ul><p>Sharon LaFraniere<!-- --> and <!-- -->Dylan Freedman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjkwYzBlZjMtNmU5Mi01ZTRlLTg4MzMtMmZmMTUzZTI2MDEy"><div id="690c0ef3-6e92-5e4e-8833-2ff153e26012" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump#690c0ef3-6e92-5e4e-8833-2ff153e26012"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian"><img alt="Karoun Demirjian" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-14T14:41:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 14, 2025, 9:41 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In his opening remarks, Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee, spoke about the failures of past civilian leaders of the Pentagon, opining that Pete Hegseth’s military experience and “unconventional” background “may be what makes Mr. Hegseth an excellent choice.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWRiYjUzNGYtZjBkOC01NWYxLThlNzEtM2Y2OGM5ZmRjOWYw"><div id="adbb534f-f0d8-55f1-8e71-3f68c9fdc9f0" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump#adbb534f-f0d8-55f1-8e71-3f68c9fdc9f0"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian"><img alt="Karoun Demirjian" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-14T14:30:44.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 14, 2025, 9:30 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Pete Hegseth, President-elect Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, just walked into the hearing room for his confirmation hearing.

Trump to intervene.</p><p>It was a stark shift for the man President-elect Trump picked to lead the Defense Department. Soldiers who served with Mr. Hegseth say the change was driven in part by a string of military deployments — once to Guantánamo Bay, once to Iraq and once to Afghanistan — that each taught him a new lesson in military dysfunction.</p><p>The experience transformed him from a neoconservative believer in U.S. military might into an outsider so distrustful of the national security establishment that he repeatedly sided with convicted murderers over Pentagon leadership.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZjQ3NjBmYTctYTAwYi01YjVlLWExOTEtZmVkYzY0NmYzOTBm"><div id="f4760fa7-a00b-5b5e-a191-fedc646f390f" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump#f4760fa7-a00b-5b5e-a191-fedc646f390f"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt"><img alt="Eric Schmitt" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-14T14:20:54.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 14, 2025, 9:20 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>If confirmed, Pete Hegseth, 44, would become the second-youngest defense secretary since the office was created in 1947.

Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, faces scrutiny from the Senate Armed Services Committee today, the questions and reactions from one particular panel member could be pivotal in determining whether he is ultimately confirmed to the position.</p><p>Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, has emerged as a potentially critical swing vote for Mr. Hegseth, whose bid to become secretary has been complicated by allegations of sexual assault, public drunkenness and corporate mismanagement.</p><div><p>The two-term senator, who was the chamber’s first female combat veteran and is a survivor of sexual assault, has for years been a critical voice in the Senate G.O.P. on how the military handles sexual assault cases and treats female war fighters. And as a small but possibly decisive number of Republican senators wrestle with their concerns about Mr. Hegseth’s background and qualifications — and weigh those against the potential consequences of crossing Mr. Trump — Ms. Ernst’s cues could be persuasive.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth needs the support of at least 50 Republican senators in order to be confirmed as defense secretary, meaning that he can lose no more than three.</p><p>In the past several weeks, Ms. Ernst has gone from being one of Mr. Hegseth’s sharpest Republican critics to adopting a more conciliatory tone, pledging to support him as he goes through the Senate’s vetting process — but stopping short of committing to vote for him.</p><p>Her shift followed the launch of an intense pressure campaign from supporters of Mr. Trump, who threatened her with political retribution if she failed to fall in line. Ms. Ernst is up for re-election in 2026.</p><p>Initially, Ms. Ernst had seemed hostile to Mr. Hegseth’s pick, telling reporters he would have his work cut out for him” and telling Fox News anchors that she was not yet a “yes” after her first meeting with him.</p><p>But after meeting with him a second time, she began signaling she might embrace Mr. Hegseth’s candidacy after all.</p><p>Between the two meetings, which were only days apart, Ms. Ernst became the target of ads in her home state, a social media effort questioning her integrity as a Republican and threats to launch primary challengers. In the weeks since, Trump-aligned groups’ efforts to pressure senators into backing Mr. Hegseth’s candidacy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-trump.html" title="">have only intensified</a>.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Ms. Ernst declined to detail what questions Ms. Ernst planned to ask Mr. Hegseth during the hearing, directing a reporter to the last statement Ms. Ernst released about Mr. Hegseth, following their second meeting.</p><p>In it, Ms. Ernst praised Mr. Hegseth for agreeing to conduct an audit of the Pentagon and appoint a senior official to “uphold the roles and value of our servicemen and women — based on quality and standards, not quotas,” and “prioritize and strengthen my work to prevent sexual assault within the ranks.”</p><p>She also indicated that she hoped that the hearing would be “fair,” and “based on truth, not anonymous sources.”</p><p>At this point, none of Mr. Hegseth’s accusers have come forward publicly to testify.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Democratic-aligned political group American Bridge 21st Century attacked Ms. Ernst for her change in tone, accusing her of abandoning her principles to save her job.</p><p>“After attempting to build a political reputation for supporting women in the military, Ernst is throwing that all away just so that she can avoid a primary and hang on to her Senate seat,” Nico Delgado, a spokesperson for the group, said in a statement that called her “a cowardly senator who abandons her supposed morals at the drop of a hat.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhhYjEyMmNmLWJjN2ItNTVhYy04OGYyLWVkZjY2NzkyMmZkZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump#pete-hegseth-drinking-alcohol" data-source-id="100000009861141"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-14T10:02:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 14, 2025, 5:02 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-lafraniere" itemprop="name">Sharon LaFraniere</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dylan-freedman" itemprop="name">Dylan Freedman</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-kelly" itemprop="name">Kate Kelly</a></p><p>Sharon LaFraniere and Kate Kelly have been covering Pete Hegseth’s path to the nomination for defense secretary.

Trump picked for defense secretary, is likely to be asked to revisit the issue of his alcohol use as part of his Senate confirmation hearings on Tuesday.</p><p>The New York Times and other news organizations have documented a pattern of excessive drinking by Mr. Hegseth. In the most serious episode, a woman in Monterey, Calif., accused him of raping her in 2017. Mr. Hegseth said the encounter was consensual, and it resulted in no criminal charges. His lawyer said Mr. Hegseth was inebriated at the time.</p><p>In an interview on Megyn Kelly’s SiriusXM show last month, Mr. Hegseth acknowledged concerns about his drinking had put his nomination at risk. He promised then that there “won’t be a drop of alcohol on my lips” if he is confirmed.</p><p>“I need to make sure the senators and the troops and President Trump and everybody else knows when you call me 24/7 you’re getting fully dialed-in Pete, just like you always did in Iraq and Afghanistan,” he said then.</p><p>Depending on how he answers the senators’ questions, Mr. Hegseth could come across as sufficiently reformed or lacking the necessary self-discipline for one of the most critical cabinet posts.</p><p>Some Democrats have promised to challenge his fitness for the position partly on the basis of his drinking. “A Secretary of Defense must exercise clear judgment and be ready to be called upon at any time, and a Secretary who struggles with excessive and inappropriate drinking undermines our national security,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, wrote <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_mrpetehegseth.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a letter to him dated Jan. 6</a>.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth’s pledge to abstain from alcohol echoed that of another nominee for defense secretary, John Tower, who in 1989 said: “If confirmed, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/1989/02/27/tower-if-confirmed-i-wont-have-a-drink/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I won’t have a drink</a>.” Mr. Tower also promised to resign if he faltered, but it still was not enough to overcome his reputation of being a carouser and the Senate voted him down.</p><p>As part of a background check that began last month, F.B.I. agents asked at least some people whether Mr. Hegseth had abused alcohol, but it was unclear as of Monday how thorough that inquiry was.</p><p>A review by The Times of Mr. Hegseth’s public statements in recent years found that he often referred to his alcohol consumption, both in describing some dark moments in his life and in light banter about enjoying “an extra pour” or a certain type of liquor.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth said in the 2021 podcast episode that he struggled to adjust to civilian life after his deployment in Iraq.</p><p>“I’d look around at 10 o’clock and be like, ‘What am I going to do today? How about I drink some beers? ’” he told Mr. Cain. “And one beer leads to many, leads to self-medication, leads to ‘I’ve earned this.’ Like, ‘Don’t tell me I can’t.’”</p><p>He said he had been able to “undo that cycle,” but did not specify when.</p><p>In 2020 and 2021, Mr. Hegseth repeatedly told a story about getting extremely drunk with a veteran involved in the 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed Osama Bin Laden.</p><p>“The first time I heard the full story from Rob O’Neill in a bar of the Bin Laden raid I thought I was going to meet him for 45 minutes. Four and a half hours later, I could barely walk and I heard the whole story,” he said on Fox Nation’s “Friday Night Live” in a 2020 episode.</p><p>As a weekend anchor for the morning show “Fox &amp; Friends” from 2017 to 2024, Mr. Hegseth and his co-workers frequently joked about his taste for beer, gin and whiskey.</p><p>Answering a question about his weight in the 2020 episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/sVGCJUJ_JXM?si=Ijl2ocSmXfq-zTyt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Fox Nation</a>, Mr. Hegseth said that his diet mostly consisted of “protein and booze.” But he also suggested that he was trying to cut down on alcohol. “I put this much soda in and this much gin in, so I’m not really drinking all that much, although I may have many glasses. You know how that goes,” he said.</p><p>Three years later, <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20231117_130000_FOX_and_Friends/start/2700/end/2760" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showing up for a “Fox &amp; Friends”</a> episode in a tuxedo from a celebration the evening before, he said, “I partied all night and I’m here and I didn’t change.”</p><p>Mr. Hegseth’s treatment of women may also come up. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/hegseth-email-text.html" title="">a 2018 email</a>, his mother, Penelope Hegseth, accused him of mistreating women for years. “I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man,” she wrote him.</p><p>Mrs. Hegseth later disavowed those sentiments and said she apologized to her son for the email.</p><p>In the interview with Ms. Kelly, Mr. Hegseth said with the help of his third wife and his religious faith, “I have become a changed man.”</p><p>Emily Steel<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2YxYTc3ZDRmLWQyNmMtNWQwMy1hNmE3LTUyMmIzZDM5YTJhOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump#pete-hegseth-trump-confirmation" data-source-id="100000009924002"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-lafraniere"><img alt="Sharon LaFraniere" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-sharon-lafraniere/author-sharon-lafraniere-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-sharon-lafraniere/author-sharon-lafraniere-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-sharon-lafraniere/author-sharon-lafraniere-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt"><img alt="Eric Schmitt" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-14T10:01:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 14, 2025, 5:01 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lawmakers are also likely to ask Pete Hegseth about major international policy issues.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice for defense secretary, will face a stream of questions on Tuesday from members of a Senate committee that is considering his expected nomination.</p><p>It could be a contentious hearing. Mr. Hegseth has faced scrutiny because of accusations of excessive drinking and an allegation of sexual assault.</p><div><p>He has also faced criticism for comments about limiting the role of women in the military.</p><p>Here is what to watch for as the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing gets underway:</p><h2 id="link-7f45807f">Questions related to his alcohol use</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth will almost surely be asked about his alcohol use. The New York Times and other news media organizations have documented a history of excessive drinking, including some episodes that Mr. Hegseth himself has described. He has vowed that if he is confirmed, there “won’t be a drop of alcohol on my lips.” Will that be sufficient for the senators on the committee?</p><h2 id="link-39aed8de">Sexual assault allegation</h2><p>How will Mr. Hegseth address concerns about a 2017 police investigation into whether he raped a woman after a speaking event in Monterey, Calif.? He has said that the sexual encounter was consensual and that he agreed to pay the woman a secret financial settlement only to protect his job. No criminal charges were filed.</p><h2 id="link-480f61be">Managerial experience</h2><p>Other defense secretaries in recent history have had vastly greater managerial experience than Mr. Hegseth, a former “Fox &amp; Friends” weekend anchor. His successive tenures as head of two small veterans groups from 2008 to 2016 ended with both in financial trouble. How will he answer questions about his ability to lead the Pentagon, an $849 billion enterprise with nearly three million employees?</p><h2 id="link-6cf86e62">Views on diversity</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth has complained about “woke” generals who he said left the military “effeminate” by supporting diversity policies that were pushing away “America’s white sons and daughters.”</p><h2 id="link-28afffa0">Women in combat</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth has also said that “we should not have women in combat roles.” He now says that women can serve if they meet the right standard. What will he say about whether he would turn back the clock in the military?</p><h2 id="link-ec41e51">International policies, including the war in Ukraine</h2><p>Lawmakers are also likely to ask Mr. Hegseth about major international policy issues. He has voiced skepticism about continuing to provide military aid to Ukraine. Is that still his view?</p><p>Given Iran’s weakened state, should the United States, perhaps acting with Israel, carry out military strikes against Iran’s nuclear program?</p><p>What additional steps does the U.S. military need to take to counter the rising military threat from China?</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzIzYjBmZjEyLTAwY2EtNWE0Ni1hM2IwLTA0NDc2NDcwNjA1Mw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/14/us/hegseth-confirmation-trump#senate-confirmation-trump-cabinet" data-source-id="100000009917352"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/noah-weiland"><img alt="Noah Weiland" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/23/reader-center/author-noah-weiland/author-noah-weiland-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/23/reader-center/author-noah-weiland/author-noah-weiland-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/23/reader-center/author-noah-weiland/author-noah-weiland-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-13T22:59:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 13, 2025, 5:59 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Senate typically holds hearings with national security and law enforcement nominees first because of the sensitivity and urgency of their work.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Some of President-elect Donald J. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-administration-cabinet-appointees.html" title="">selections for cabinet positions</a> are set to begin confirmation hearings this week, paving the way for them to serve in their roles around the start of his administration. But the hearings — the most public part of the confirmation process — are just one feature of a complicated vetting of those hoping to run federal agencies.</p><p>The Senate, which scrutinizes and approves candidates in a process described in the Constitution as “advice and consent,” typically holds hearings with national security and law enforcement nominees first because of the sensitivity and urgency of their work. Pam Bondi, Mr. Trump’s choice for attorney general, and Pete Hegseth, his selection for defense secretary, are among more than a dozen candidates who will be questioned by lawmakers this week.</p><div><p>Here are the steps nominees and prospective nominees take after a president-elect chooses them for a post and before they can be confirmed.</p><h2 id="link-41a78cec">Meetings with senators</h2><p>Nominees for cabinet posts typically visit Capitol Hill well before their confirmation hearings, allowing lawmakers to get to know them informally and express support, or press them on potential policy disputes that may arise later in the confirmation process.</p><p>They work with advisers<span>  </span>who help them navigate the Capitol complex and handle interactions with Senate committees and offices. They are typically swamped with briefing materials.</p><p>Janet Napolitano, the former governor of Arizona who became the head of the Homeland Security Department under President Barack Obama, recalled the reading she did during her confirmation process.</p><p>“I remember looking at the door of the governor’s office one day, and a man is coming down with a dolly filled with 3-inch binders of briefing materials from D.H.S.,” she said. “And I remember thinking to myself, ‘Oh God, what have I gotten myself into?’”</p><p>“I had to learn the difference between a ship and a boat,” Ms. Napolitano added.</p><p>Candidates often use the Capitol visits to present themselves as having momentum. Some of Mr. Trump’s more divisive picks for top positions, including Kash Patel, the potential F.B.I. director, have met in recent weeks with friendly Republican senators who afterward posted photos and statements affirming their support.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Ratcliffe, center, Mr. Trump’s choice for C.I.A. director, meeting with Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, at the Capitol in December. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The meetings are also a chance for candidates to demonstrate bipartisanship. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, Mr. Trump’s choice for ambassador to the United Nations, has met with Democrats who have indicated support, including <a href="https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2025/01/08/rosen-meets-with-nominee-for-u-s-ambassador-to-the-united-nations-elise-stefanik/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5035700-fetterman-endorses-stefanik-un-ambassador/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania</a>.</p><h2 id="link-6056ee77">An ethics review and background check</h2><p>Nominees must submit <a href="https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documents</a> on their work and education backgrounds — a kind of supersize résumé that federal officials use to conduct investigations into a candidate’s work and personal life, including whether they used drugs or have a police record. Many high-level candidates submit <a href="https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf86.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a more expansive version</a> of the document that explores potential foreign contacts or travel.</p><p>The F.B.I. uses those forms to complete background checks that lawmakers use to evaluate candidates, like one conducted on Mr. Hegseth that top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/politics/fbi-briefing-hegseth-senators.html" title="">were briefed on last week</a> ahead of Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation hearing Tuesday.</p><p>(Mr. Trump’s transition team had considered bypassing the F.B.I. background checks by using private investigators but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/us/trump-fbi-background-checks.html" title="">later signed an agreement with the Justice Department</a> allowing those checks. Still, it was unclear whether all of Mr. Trump’s nominees were undergoing the process.)</p><p>Nominees must also complete an Office of Government Ethics document known as <a href="https://www.oge.gov/web/278eguide.nsf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OGE Form 278</a>, which examines possible conflicts of interest a candidate might have in running an agency. Many of those forms have been published in recent days, including for <a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/29FAFD2E18579CE285258C0F00336B70/$FILE/Rubio%2C%20Marco%20%20final278.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marco Rubio</a>, Mr. Trump’s choice for secretary of state.</p><p>The questionnaire asks about a candidate’s financial background, such as assets held, forms of income and gifts received. Potential conflicts do not disqualify someone. But nominees do have to resolve them in some way in a formal ethics agreement with the federal government. Corporate executives appointed to top positions, for example, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/business/dealbook/bessent-lutnick-divestments.html" title="">regularly required</a> to divest from stock.</p><p>“That ethics agreement is often one of the most complex and important parts of the entire nominee screening process,” said Norman Eisen, who was an ethics official in the Obama administration. “That is the place where, for example, former employers or clients or current financial interests are identified, and arrangements are made to recuse the nominee from working on relevant particular matters or other issues.”</p><p>Scott Bessent, Mr. Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary who has made millions as an investor and hedge fund manager, on Saturday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/business/scott-bessent-treasury-divest.html" title="">released his plan</a> to divest from dozens of funds, trusts and investments.</p><p>Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary under President Barack Obama, said that she adjusted her stock portfolio so that there was no risk of it conflicting with the work of the Food and Drug Administration, in particular, since she would oversee that agency.</p><p>“There was extensive, forensic audit of our finances,” she said, referring to vetting by the Senate Finance Committee, one of the panels that checks the background of a health and human services secretary nominee. “You’re getting policy briefings, and questions about 10 years ago when you sold your house: ‘What did you do about this?’”</p><h2 id="link-46f24b8b">Meeting with Senate staff and confirmation hearings</h2><p>Only in the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/nominations/executive-nominations-overview.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">middle of the 20th century</a> did Senate committees begin requiring nominees to meet with them in person.</p><p>Candidates are vetted by committees that oversee the agencies they hope to lead. Ms. Bondi, the president-elect’s pick for attorney general, is being evaluated by the Senate Judiciary Committee, for example.</p><p>Early on, committees may ask candidates to provide disclosure forms for staff members to review, or ask them to meet in person with staff members. Candidates may be questioned about their policy positions, as they might be during official confirmation hearings.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the Capitol, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary pick, greets Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, Mr. Trump’s choice for ambassador to the United Nations.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>John Ratcliffe, whom Mr. Trump selected to run the C.I.A., provided background documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee staff ahead of his hearing this week.</p><p>A candidate’s interactions with committees culminate in hearings, the most dramatic and visible part of the confirmation process. In a public hearing, nominees first take an oath to speak truthfully, then deliver opening statements to the committee that usually summarize their priorities and experience related to the jobs they hope to take. Members of the committees from both parties have time-limited slots to ask nominees questions.</p><p>Some nominees will face multiple hearings because of their potential job’s broad portfolio. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for example, Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary, is expected to have hearings in both the Senate health committee and the Senate Finance Committee.</p><p>Senators may also request further information after a hearing in what are known as questions for the record, or Q.F.R.s.</p><h2 id="link-2c523169">The committee and Senate vote</h2><p>After a confirmation hearing, a committee votes on whether to recommend a candidate to the full Senate, formally teeing up a final confirmation vote.
