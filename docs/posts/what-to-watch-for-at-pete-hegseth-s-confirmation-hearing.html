    <h1>What to Watch for at Pete Hegseth’s Confirmation Hearing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice for defense secretary, will face a stream of questions on Tuesday from members of a Senate committee that is considering his expected nomination.</p><p>It could be a contentious hearing. Mr. Hegseth has faced scrutiny because of accusations of excessive drinking and an allegation of sexual assault.</p><p>He has also faced criticism for comments about limiting the role of women in the military.</p><p>Here is what to watch for as the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing gets underway:</p><h2 id="link-7f45807f">Questions related to his alcohol use</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth will almost surely be asked about his alcohol use. The New York Times and other news media organizations have documented a history of excessive drinking, including some episodes that Mr. Hegseth himself has described. He has vowed that if he is confirmed, there “won’t be a drop of alcohol on my lips.” Will that be sufficient for the senators on the committee?</p><h2 id="link-39aed8de">Sexual assault allegation</h2><p>How will Mr. Hegseth address concerns about a 2017 police investigation into whether he raped a woman after a speaking event in Monterey, Calif.? He has said that the sexual encounter was consensual and that he agreed to pay the woman a secret financial settlement only to protect his job. No criminal charges were filed.</p></div></div>
