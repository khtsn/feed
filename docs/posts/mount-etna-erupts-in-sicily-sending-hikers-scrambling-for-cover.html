In recent years, authorities have struggled to control <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/28/etna-eruptions-cause-despair-among-mountain-rescuers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imprudent visitors</a> who failed to appreciate the risks of getting a close look at the island’s most prominent landmark. Mount Etna, a stratovolcano, or a conical volcano with relatively steep sides, shows almost continuous activity from its main craters and relatively frequent lava flows from craters and fissures along its sides. A previous major eruption had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/mount-etna-tourists-eruption.html" title="">occurred in February</a>.</p><p>Hannah and Charlie Camper, a couple from England, were vacationing at Villa Carlino House, which sits about 10 miles east of the volcano’s central crater, when <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thattravelcouple/video/7511356694228684054" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">volcanic plumes began billowing near the summit</a>.</p><p>The couple was aware of previous eruptions but thought they would be “completely fine,” since “it’s active all the time,” Ms. Camper said in a WhatsApp message. Ms. Camper said they weren’t sure what to do if the activity worsened. They did not receive any emergency messages on their phones. After filming the video, they ran inside and began searching the internet for safety warnings.</p><p>“We were waiting to hear something, but nothing came through even though the smoke was getting bigger and coming toward us,” she said. “At one point we could see the lava coming down the volcano.”</p><p>Sicily, the setting for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/25/style/white-lotus-vacation.html" title="">second season of the hit series “The White Lotus,”</a> has grown <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/06/climate/italy-sicily-water-shortage-drought-tourism-intl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increasingly popular</a> among tourists in recent years, despite being plagued by heat, wildfires and water shortages.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
