Nearly 50,000 people have fled their homes, and tens of thousands lack running water. Civilians are being laid out in body bags on hospital floors after shells struck their neighborhoods.</p><p>Scenes from the bloodiest days of Syria’s civil war, which had lain largely dormant for several years, are now repeating themselves in the country’s northwest as pro-government forces try to beat back a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">surprise rebel offensive</a>, according to aid workers, a war monitor and the United Nations, who warned of a rapidly worsening humanitarian situation.</p><p>Conditions were already dire for civilians in the area: Years of war and a powerful February 2023 earthquake had led to crushing poverty, displacement and breakdowns in services. But over the last several days, the region’s misery deepened as Russian and Syrian fighter jets have repeatedly struck Idlib and Aleppo in northwestern Syria and rebels fought to capture more territory.</p><p>The United Nations said more than 50 airstrikes had hit Idlib Province in northwestern Syria on Sunday and Monday. Four health facilities, four schools and two camps housing people displaced from earlier phases of the conflict suffered damage, it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Stéphane Dujarric, a U.N. spokesman, said in a briefing Monday night that a strike on a water station had also cut off access for at least 40,000 people. And the Norwegian Refugee Council, which provides aid in the region, said its humanitarian workers were reporting that bakeries and shops had shut down in Aleppo, leading to food shortages.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03syria-vcjq/03syria-vcjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03syria-vcjq/03syria-vcjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03syria-vcjq/03syria-vcjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An aerial view of a tent with belongings spread about." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03syria-vcjq/03syria-vcjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03syria-vcjq/03syria-vcjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03syria-vcjq/03syria-vcjq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03syria-vcjq/03syria-vcjq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9ac3873e-3d0e-5651-9861-5e8ef1c88e98" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damage at a camp for displaced people north of Idlib on Monday.

At SAMS Maternity Hospital and Ibn Sina Children’s Hospital, heavily damaged incubator units for premature infants were seen.</p><p>Dr. Mohammed Hussam Kaddouh, the director of Idlib University Hospital, said on Tuesday that his facility was one of two that was knocked completely out of service by strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The strikes directly targeted the hospital,” Dr. Kaddouh said. “Right now we’re mainly relying on the remaining medical centers outside of Idlib.”</p><p>One strike hit the hospital’s eastern wing in front of the emergency room’s entrance, Dr. Kaddouh said, and another its northern wing. On Tuesday, large shards of glass were still visible in front of a reception desk. Units that housed patients were torn apart, their ceilings displaying gaping holes, with debris strewed through hallways and patient rooms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An injured girl and a woman being transported to a hospital in northwestern Syria on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Muhammad Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>One missile slammed through two reinforced concrete roofs and landed in the hospital’s basement, according to Dr. Kaddouh, who said no one was injured in the strikes because people inside were able to evacuate in time.</p><p>University Hospital typically serves about 1,100 patients a day and nearly 30,000 a month, Dr. Kaddouh added. Its cardiology and obstetrics and gynecology departments are the only ones in the city, he said; now patients must leave the city to find those services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At least 44 civilians have been killed in fighting in Idlib and northern Aleppo between the start of the offensive last week and Sunday, according to the United Nations, which said the numbers were verified by local health authorities. At least 162 more were reported injured, nearly two-thirds of them women and children, it said.</p><p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said at least 26 more people were killed in pro-government airstrikes across the region on Monday. On Tuesday, it reported that 20 civilians in the western city of Hama were killed when rebel factions shelled government-held neighborhoods as they tried to capture the city, and another two civilians were killed in airstrikes on the city of Khan Sheikhoun.</p><p>About 5.1 million people live in northwestern Syria, according to U.N. figures, including 3.5 million who were displaced to Idlib from other parts of the country and two million who have been living in camps or other temporary shelters. Thousands fled the recent war in Lebanon for northwestern Syria, adding to the pressure on a region where many already struggled to get food and shelters warm enough for winter.</p><p>The latest fighting has driven at least 48,500 people to flee their homes or shelters, and the number was rising rapidly, the United Nations warned.</p><p>Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York, and <!-- -->Rania Khaled<!-- --> from Cairo.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
