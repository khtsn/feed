The rules have garnered praise from financial industry groups and others who generally don’t have anything nice to say about how Mr. Chopra has been running the agency.</p><p>The more palatable regulations come ahead of a Republican takeover of Washington that could once again put the consumer agency in the cross hairs. Republicans have long tried to chip away at the agency’s power and independence. More recently, banks have challenged its authority in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/business/bank-lobbyists-regulators-cfpb.html" title="">lawsuits</a> over rules established under Mr. Chopra’s direction.</p><p>“The rulemakings that we’ve seen over the past three weeks are strategically intended to show that there are indeed areas of bipartisan agreement in the financial regulatory system, and, by extension, that the C.F.P.B. has a legitimate place in the regulatory ecosystem,” said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at the brokerage firm BTIG.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The bureau’s latest actions could help blunt some of financial industry representatives’ fierce anger toward it, which has only grown over Mr. Chopra’s tenure. It could also create fissures between competing forces in the industry that could make it harder for officials to completely do away with some of the bureau’s latest rules or eliminate the agency altogether.</p><p>For instance, powerful banks have applauded the bureau’s move to regulate the payments services that big tech firms offer to customers. Banks have long argued that if their companies must be subject to extensive regulation, then tech firms providing the same services should as well. If the consumer bureau were weakened enough that it could not carry out this task, it could put banks at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>“I believe that the C.F.P.B. is likely here to stay,” said Lindsey Johnson, the president and chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association.</p><p>Ms. Johnson said her group has been one of the most vocally concerned about the direction of the consumer bureau because she thought its current leaders were more focused on leaning into “political polling to drive their agenda.” But she said the agency has taken some steps in the right direction to fulfill its mission of protecting consumers and that there were opportunities for banks to work with regulators.</p><p>Still, the agency’s fate is far from certain. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who will lead what Mr. Trump has called the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-trump.html" title="">Department of Government Efficiency</a>, have voiced support for eliminating the bureau altogether.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Nov. 27, Mr. Musk posted on X: “Delete C.F.P.B. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” In a separate post, Mr. Ramaswamy said that consumers were “no better off” since its establishment.</p><p>But getting rid of the agency would require legislators to abolish it and reassign its regulatory powers, an option Republicans are already viewing as unlikely given the slim margins in Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk, with his son X Æ A-Xii Musk, and Vivek Ramaswamy on Capitol Hill yesterday.

But he believed there would be wider support for a milder change to how it was run, like restructuring its leadership to make it a bipartisan commission, which would be similar to the structures of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p><p>Mr. Hill also believes the bureau should not have authority over smaller banks. Currently, it supervises any bank with more than $10 billion in assets. He wants that lower limit raised.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I want to make sure that we have and make the reforms in the C.F.P.B. that makes it a more responsive agency to Congress, and allows that consumer protection mission in federal statutes to be met, but be met in the most effective way possible with the least cost, with benefits to the consumer, but not disproportionate burdens to the financial services sector,” Mr. Hill said.</p><p>The bureau has been under fire since its creation as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, but Republicans took their biggest swings at it after Mr. Trump was first elected in 2016. Mick Mulvaney, whom Mr. Trump named its acting director in 2017, tried to zero out its budget and change its name. Neither change lasted. The Supreme Court has since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/politics/supreme-court-cfpb.html" title="">upheld</a> the constitutionality of the bureau’s funding structure.</p><p>Mr. Trump has yet to tap anyone to lead the bureau, but bankers, former Trump officials and regulatory experts said they expected whomever assumes control will almost certainly freeze the rules issued under Mr. Chopra and examine whether to scrap them, or adjust them according to industry feedback. The bureau’s next leader could also reduce the number of investigations and punitive actions for financial firms that break its rules.</p><p>Since taking over the agency in 2021, Mr. Chopra has sought to expand the authority the bureau exercises over the banks and other financial firms it is tasked with overseeing, often using broad interpretations of the laws that created it. Bank lobbyists generally describe his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/business/rohit-chopra-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-wallstreet.html" title="">tenure</a> as an uncompromising power grab.</p><p>Douglas P. Faucette, a partner at Locke Lord who is chairman of the law firm’s bank regulatory group, described Mr. Chopra as having been “as radical as any regulator could be.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Among the most-criticized rules Mr. Chopra has finalized are a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/business/credit-card-late-fees.html" title="">cap on credit card late fees</a> and new <a href="https://www.lockelord.com/newsandevents/publications/2023/06/quickstudycfpd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public reporting requirements</a> for small business lending. Banks also sued over Mr. Chopra’s plan to start using an unfair and deceptive practices law to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/business/cfpb-suit-american-bankers-association.html" title="">check</a> their activities for discrimination. And they decried new limits the bureau imposed on their ability to charge overdraft fees, even though many had changed their overdraft practices even before the new limits were put in place.</p><p>But some recent rules have garnered more mixed reactions from the industry. One requires banks to share customer data with other technology firms offering those customers services the banks don’t provide. It prompted Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, to call for banks to “fight back” against regulation, but was a boon to financial technology companies, popularly known as fintechs.</p><p>On the other hand, banks loved the rule that came next: a finalization of the bureau’s proposal to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/business/cfpb-paypal-venmo-cashapp.html" title="">oversee big tech companies</a>, including Apple and Google, that provide payment services.</p><p>“One of our few areas of agreement with Director Chopra is his recognition that Big Tech is taking advantage of legal loopholes to offer financial services without federal supervision,” Sarah Grano, an American Bankers Association spokeswoman, said in a statement. “We hope the next C.F.P.B. director and the next Congress will continue to focus on the growth of Big Tech in financial services, and the risks that poses to consumers.”</p><p>Phil Goldfeder, the chief executive of the American Fintech Council, said the group had “wholeheartedly” disagreed with some of the C.F.P.B.’s actions while supporting others. The data-sharing rule could encourage competition in the marketplace and expand access to different types of financial services, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Our priorities for the coming years haven’t changed based on the election,” Mr. Goldfeder said. “If the C.F.P.B. exists, we look forward to engaging with them.”</p><p>Mr. Chopra said in an interview that he thought the C.F.P.B.’s actions under his leadership were more popular than the financial industry wanted to admit.</p><p>“The rules we have pursued have extremely broad support from the public, but of course it’s no surprise that lobbyists and other special interests want to defund us and shut us down,” he said.</p><p>Industry officials support overhauling some of the bureau’s rules. Ms. Johnson, the consumer bank trade leader, said the group would support attempts by the Trump administration to scrutinize rules that cap most credit card late fees at $8, or that allow consumers to more easily access and share personal financial data with other companies.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Emily Flitter writes about finance and how it impacts society.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-flitter">More about Emily Flitter</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Madeleine Ngo covers U.S. economic policy and how it affects people across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/madeleine-ngo">More about Madeleine Ngo</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/bureau-of-consumer-financial-protection-cfpb">Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (C.F.P.B.)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/rohit-chopra">Rohit Chopra</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/vivek-ramaswamy">Vivek Ramaswamy</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Biden’s Team Considers Blanket Pardons:</strong> President Biden’s staff is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/biden-trump-pardons.html">debating blanket pardons</a> for a swath of President-elect Donald Trump’s perceived enemies to protect them from the “retribution” he has threatened, according to people familiar with the discussion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Urban Shift Toward Trump:</strong> Big cities have faced serious problems lately.
