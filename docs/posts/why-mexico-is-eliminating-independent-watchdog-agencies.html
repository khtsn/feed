Critics have <a href="https://x.com/amedi_ac/status/1855678609114980461" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called it a step backward</a> for transparency and regulation.</p><p>The duties of most of the seven agencies, which provided oversight on a host of issues, such as public information requests and <a href="https://elpais.com/mexico/economia/2024-10-29/la-cofece-presenta-su-primera-demanda-colectiva-en-su-historia-por-la-manipulacion-en-los-precios-de-medicamentos.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">price fixing</a> in the telecommunications, pharmaceutical and energy sectors, would be absorbed by other parts of the federal government, overseen by the president.</p><p>Perhaps the most noteworthy of the agencies — the National Institute for Transparency, Access to Information and Protection of Personal Data, known as INAI — would have its responsibilities divided among a handful of existing federal agencies.</p><p>“The disappearance of these autonomous bodies represents a democratic setback,” the Mexican Association for the Right to Information, a nongovernmental group, <a href="https://www.amedi.org.mx/extinguir-la-autonomia-del-ift-e-inai-es-un-retroceso-y-vulnera-el-derecho-a-la-informacion/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>. The move, the group added, “weakens the mechanisms of control, transparency and protection of rights that have been built with great effort in our country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The constitutional amendment dissolving the agencies is part of a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/americas/mexico-sheinbaum-amlo-peso.html" title="">far-reaching proposals</a> pushed by the former Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, that are supported by his successor and mentee, Claudia Sheinbaum, and by their political party, Morena.</p><p>In September, Mexico <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/americas/mexico-overhaul-judiciary-law.html" title="">passed an amendment</a> overhauling the country’s judiciary, which supporters of the proposal said was riddled with graft, influence-peddling and nepotism. Critics warned that the move, which will see nearly all Mexican judges elected rather than appointed, undermines judicial independence and politicizes the courts.</p><p>Morena has also targeted the independent agencies because of what it has called excessive spending and corruption.</p><p>The latest amendment would also <a href="https://comunicacionsocial.diputados.gob.mx/index.php/boletines/comision-de-puntos-constitucionales-aprobo-dictamen-que-plantea-la-extincion-de-siete-organismos-autonomos-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dissolve the independent watchdogs</a> at the state level that oversee public information requests and the protection of personal data.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The bill already passed in the lower house of Congress last week.

In July, <a href="https://politica.expansion.mx/presidencia/2024/07/31/con-absorcion-de-autonomos-amlo-estima-ahorros-por-100-000-mdp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. López Obrador estimated</a> that up to roughly $5 billion would be saved by dissolving them, though it is unclear how that number was calculated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He has criticized top INAI officials for having large salaries (he said the agency’s commissioners make over $12,000 a month; the minimum wage in the country is roughly $360 a month) and for abusing government-issued credit cards (Internal audits found that officials had logged unusually high spending, including charging trips to Europe.)</p><p>Mr. López Obrador also <a href="https://elpais.com/mexico/economia/2024-02-16/lopez-obrador-sobre-el-fallo-de-la-cofece-yo-ni-esperaba-que-aprobaran-pero-fue-un-avance.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attacked the economic competition commission</a>, accusing it of being vulnerable to the whims of large companies.</p><p>Claudia Rivera, a Morena lawmaker in the lower house of Congress, said that amendment to abolish the agencies was part of the government’s “financial discipline” strategy.</p><p>“It’s about making the spending more efficient,” she said, adding that the agencies’ work “is not lost, not neglected” but transferred to existing ministries or institutes.</p><p>Critics have argued that dissolving some agencies might violate the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/economy/usmca-deal.html" title="">United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement</a>. That trade accord <a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/465841/18Telecommunications.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls for an independent regulatory telecommunications agency</a> in each country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Ms. Sheinbaum <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/sheinbaum-confirma-desaparicion-inai-y-adelanta-plan-fusionar-organismos-autonomos-secretarias-20241120-735008.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the “original spirit of guaranteeing economic competition and antimonopoly” under the trade agreement would be maintained, but in a way “more appropriate for our national context.”</p><p>She said she planned to restructure the economic competition and telecommunications agencies into a decentralized and independent organization within the existing economy ministry.</p><h2 id="link-54e83b7">Why are critics against the changes?</h2><p>Opponents have acknowledged that graft and misspending are chronic problems in Mexico. But Jorge Cano, an economist and public finances analyst at Mexico Evaluates, a public policy research group, said that Morena’s estimates of $5 billion savings are “beyond the realm of reality.”</p><p>Mr. Cano’s group said that the seven agencies received $238 million this year from the government, representing only about 0.06 percent of Mexico’s annual federal budget.</p><p>Natalia Campos, a public policy researcher at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a research group, said that the disappearance of the agencies was likely to hurt <a href="https://imco.org.mx/desaparicion-de-organos-autonomos/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico’s investment climate</a> by getting rid of agencies that oversee markets and the government itself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Diego Marroquín Bitar, a researcher at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan study institute in Washington, said, “One of the reasons that a lot of foreign investors invest in Mexico and decide to bet on Mexico is because they know there are clear and stable rules.”</p><p>The telecommunications commission <a href="https://www.ift.org.mx/comunicacion-y-medios/comunicados-ift/es/posicionamiento-del-ift-sobre-la-aprobacion-del-dictamen-de-la-comision-de-puntos-constitucionales" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said</a> that, since it was made an independent agency in <a href="https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5301941&amp;fecha=11/06/2013#gsc.tab=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2013</a>, Mexicans have paid significantly less for services, including phone and internet, despite rising inflation during that time. Changing its structure, it said, “would lead to a serious setback.”</p><p>Zorayda Gallegos, an independent investigative journalist, said INAI was “very important” because it forced other government offices to be more open, including providing copies of contracts from federal agencies, such as the traditionally opaque Mexican military.</p><p>The plan to move part of INAI’s duties to the civil service ministry, Ms. Gallegos said, would mean “the loss of a guarantee to the citizen” to be able to obtain information.</p><p>Recently, she said, she asked the civil service ministry for a copy of a yearslong investigation into a public official who ended up avoiding disciplinary action. She said she <a href="https://x.com/zogallegos/status/1854632629032653276" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received</a> an 18-page document that had been almost entirely redacted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Of particular concern to some critics is the future of the National Platform of Transparency, a <a href="https://www.plataformadetransparencia.org.mx/Inicio" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> where anyone can request information from any government agency. Once the request is answered, the records are accessible for anyone to view.</p><p>The amendment does not specify what will happen to the agency’s huge database or how the government plans to maintain it, said Julieta del Río Venegas, an INAI commissioner.</p><p>“The management of transparency and data should be done by an autonomous institution,” she said. Leaving that responsibility to the government, she added, would make it “judge and jury.”</p><p>Miriam Castillo<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>James Wagner covers Latin America, including sports, and is based in Mexico City.
