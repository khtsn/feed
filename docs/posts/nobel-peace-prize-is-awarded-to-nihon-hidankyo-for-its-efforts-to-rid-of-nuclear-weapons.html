These survivors, known as the hibakusha, are living memorials to the horror of the attacks and have used their testimony to raise awareness of the human consequences of nuclear warfare.</p><div><p>The Nobel — one of the world’s most prestigious honors — recognizes the group at a time when survivors of the attacks, which killed an estimated 200,000 people, are mostly in their 80s and are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/06/opinion/hiroshima-nagasaki-atomic-bombing.html" title="">dying by the hundreds each month</a>. And it comes as <a href="#an-award-for-japanese-survivors-reflects-new-global-concerns" title="">the world confronts increasing worries</a> about Russia’s veiled threats that it could use its arsenal as the war in Ukraine continues and about the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea.</p><p>“The hibakusha help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons,” Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said during his announcement on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Frydnes added that “extraordinary efforts” by survivors of the U.S. nuclear bombings, including those who are part of Nihon Hidankyo, “have contributed greatly to the establishment of the nuclear taboo.” That, he said, had led to a world in which no weapons of that type had been used in war in 80 years.</p><p>He added that it was alarming to see that taboo fading in recent years.</p><p>Mr. Frydnes said that the Nobel committee, in honoring Nihon Hidankyo, wished “to honor all survivors who despite physical suffering and painful memories have chosen to use their painful experience to cultivate hope.”</p><p>The Peace Prize is arguably the most distinguished of the Nobels, and its recipients have often been celebrated global figures, such as Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai, President Barack Obama and the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso.</p><p>The 2023 prize was awarded to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/06/world/nobel-peace-prize" title="">Narges Mohammadi</a>, an imprisoned Iranian human rights activist.</p><p>The prize, first awarded in 1901, has also been <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-peace-prizes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">given to 30 organizations</a>, including twice to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and three times to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The World Food Program, a U.N. agency, received the award in 2020.</p><p>This year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which administers the prize, registered 286 candidates, including 197 individuals and 89 organizations.</p><p>Apoorva Mandavilli<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="27" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2NjODI1Y2MxLTdlZTAtNTAyNC1hNDk0LWZhNjgyNWIwYWM1NQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/11/world/nobel-peace-prize-winner#nobel-peace-prize-nihon-hidanyuo-atomic-bomb" data-source-id="100000009756440"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-11T18:08:29.802Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 11, 2024, 2:08 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hannah-beech" itemprop="name">Hannah Beech</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hisako-ueno" itemprop="name">Hisako Ueno</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kiuko-notoya" itemprop="name">Kiuko Notoya</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2NjODI1Y2MxLTdlZTAtNTAyNC1hNDk0LWZhNjgyNWIwYWM1NQ=="><a href="#nobel-peace-prize-nihon-hidanyuo-atomic-bomb">For Atomic Bomb Survivors, a Nobel Prize and a Reckoning, 80 Years Later</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The devastation of Hiroshima in the aftermath of the atomic bombing in 1945, in a photo released by the United States government.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">United States Army</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Cities blasted to rubble.

Struggling with survivors’ guilt and sick with illnesses caused by the radiation, they were shunned for years as living reminders of the human capacity to engineer horror.</p><p>On Friday, Nihon Hidankyo, a collective of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, was awarded the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons.</p><p>The group was honored by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for “demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again.”</p><p>The survivors of the bombings — more than 100,000 are still living — “help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons,” Jørgen Watne Frydnes, the committee chairman, said,</p><p>The Nobel committee noted that although nuclear weapons have not been used since the Japanese cities were attacked by American bombers in August 1945, nuclear powers are modernizing their arsenals and other countries are trying to join the nuclear club.</p><p>The committee did not name any specific nations. But President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has threatened to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. And concerns are growing about nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and Asia.</p><p>“At this moment in human history, it is worth reminding ourselves what nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons the world has ever seen,” the committee said.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shigemitsu Tanaka, a member of Nihon Hidankyo, reacting in Nagasaki, Japan, after the Nobel announcement on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kyodo, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Other Nobel laureates have been awarded the Peace Prize for their campaigns against nuclear weapons, including the chemist turned activist Linus Pauling in 1962 and the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2005.</p><p>It was nearly 80 years ago, on Aug. 6 and 9, 1945, that American B-29 bombers dropped two atomic weapons, code named Little Boy and Fat Man, on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Nobel committee said that about 120,000 people were killed by the detonations. A similar number died from burns, injuries and radiation-induced diseases in the months and years that followed.</p><p>That first and only use of nuclear weapons was followed by the end of World War II, but also by a nuclear weapons arms race. In the deserts of China and Algeria and on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/olympics/olympics-tahiti-nuclear-testing.html" title="">atolls of the South Pacific</a>, nuclear powers tested increasingly more powerful weapons that spewed harmful radiation.</p><p>Today, nine countries are considered nuclear powers: the United States, Russia, France, China, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. There are nearly 13,000 weapons in the global nuclear stockpile, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p><p>In Japan, the payloads dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki echoed far beyond the ruined cities. A once martial Japan blossomed into a culture that has dedicated itself, even in its Constitution, to peace. Japanese children flashed peace signs for photos and Olympic ceremonies in Japan featured white doves. But many Japanese felt more comfortable averting their gaze from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/06/opinion/hiroshima-nagasaki-atomic-bombing.html" title="">hibakusha</a>, or “the people affected by bombs,” as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors are known.</p><p>For many in Japan — and in the United States — the hibakusha represented something that they didn’t want to see. When Terumi Tanaka, a representative of Nihon Hidankyo, visited the United Nations in 1976, he was shocked to discover that, at the time, the ruination caused by the atomic bombs was not that well known. The U.N. had drastically downplayed the death toll.</p><p>Some Japanese feared that radiation-induced diseases were contagious, and hibakusha worried about their marriage and career prospects. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/world/asia/sunao-tsuboi-dead.html" title="">Sunao Tsuboi</a>, the onetime chairman of Nihon Hidankyo who was less than a mile from the center of the Hiroshima blast when it went off, recalled that he and his fiancée took sleeping pills in a suicide pact after being told by her parents that they could not wed because he was a hibakusha. (They survived and married, and Mr. Tsuboi met President Barack Obama when he visited Hiroshima in 2016.)</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sunao Tsuboi, a survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, photographed in 2016.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johannes Eisele/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“Starting with the inhumane acts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we were oppressed by the United States and abandoned by the Japanese government for a long time,” Sueichi Kido, the secretary general of Nihon Hidankyo and a survivor of the Nagasaki bomb, told NHK, the Japanese broadcaster, on Friday.</p><p>When Nihon Hidankyo formed in 1956, its founding declaration described the stigma of outliving nuclear annihilation. “We have survived until now in silence, with our heads down,” the statement said.</p><p>In the years after the war, the hibakusha were living evidence of the fact that the United States, which occupied Japan after World War II and imposed upon the nation a Constitution that renounced war, had caused the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p><p>The hibakusha were also a counternarrative to a Japan that was developing into a high-tech economic giant fueled, in some cases, by nuclear power. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which led to a meltdown at a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, once again forced a national moment of reflection. Since the nuclear accident, most of Japan’s nuclear reactors remain shuttered.</p><p>These days, the hibakusha, whose largest grouping is Nihon Hidankyo, are celebrated for their continued campaign against nuclear weapons despite the obstacles. Many have dedicated their lives to recounting their stories of loss and pain, in an effort to ensure that the world comprehends the profound terror that a nuclear war could bring.</p><p>The Nobel committee said that such witness accounts “have contributed greatly to the establishment of a nuclear taboo.”</p><p>But that taboo, said Mr. Frydnes, the Nobel committee chairman, “is under pressure.”</p><p>Henrik Urdal, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said in a statement that threats by both longtime nuclear powers and by newer actors show the crucial timing of the prize awarded to Nihon Hidankyo.</p><p>“In an era where automated weapon systems and A.I.-driven warfare are emerging, their call for disarmament is not just historical, it is a critical message for our future,” Mr. Urdal said.</p><p>In awarding the peace prize to Nihon Hidankyo, the Nobel committee said that even though the hibakusha are growing old, a new generation of Japanese could campaign for nuclear disarmament.</p><p>But Japan’s neighbors include Russia and China.</p><p>From Laos, where he was attending a regional summit, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan said that it was “extremely significant” that Nihon Hidankyo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>Mr. Ishiba, who was previously the country’s defense minister, has called for Japan to adopt a more muscular military stance. He supports revising Japan’s Constitution to add a specific mention of Japan’s military, which is called the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/world/asia/japan-military.html" title="">Japan Self-Defense Forces</a>. The United States is treaty-bound to defend Japan if it comes under attack, and Mr. Ishiba, before he became prime minister, suggested that the United States could possibly share its nuclear weapons with Asia.</p><p>And while the Japanese public still overwhelmingly supports nuclear disarmament, some young people have expressed support for the nuclear deterrence theory, in which countries arm themselves to deter attack, a Nihon Hidankyo member told the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Toshiyuki Mimaki, the chairman of Nihon Hidankyo, said on Friday that his foremost wish was for the world to “please abolish nuclear weapons while we are alive.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jiji Press, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Last year, at a summit in Hiroshima, the Group of 7 nations released a statement that did not call outright for nuclear disarmament, instead urging that nuclear weapons “for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression and prevent war and coercion.”</p><p>But Toshiyuki Mimaki, the chairman of Nihon Hidankyo, said on Friday that his foremost wish was for the world to “please abolish nuclear weapons while we are alive.”</p><p>Mr. Mimaki is 82.</p><p>Megan Specia<!-- -->, <!-- -->Steven Erlanger<!-- -->, <!-- -->Anton Troianovski<!-- -->, <!-- -->John Yoon<!-- --> and <!-- -->Lynsey Chutel<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad0"><div id="ad-0" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="24" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M5YmE0OGI3LTVjNmUtNWQ4ZS1hYzQ3LTk0MjQzNGU4MTY4Yg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/11/world/nobel-peace-prize-winner#they-were-bombed-and-then-shunned-now-the-nuclear-survivors-are-being-honored" data-source-id="100000009756539"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-11T14:17:42.803Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 11, 2024, 10:17 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hannah-beech" itemprop="name">Hannah Beech</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hisako-ueno" itemprop="name">Hisako Ueno</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kiuko-notoya" itemprop="name">Kiuko Notoya</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M5YmE0OGI3LTVjNmUtNWQ4ZS1hYzQ3LTk0MjQzNGU4MTY4Yg=="><a href="#they-were-bombed-and-then-shunned-now-the-nuclear-survivors-are-being-honored">They were bombed, and then shunned.

about the potential use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine and about nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and Asia.</p><p>In announcing the award, the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed its fear that the “taboo” against the use of nuclear weapons was under threat, without identifying any countries in particular.</p><div><p>But the committee’s decision follows intermittent threats by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/europe/putin-russia-nuclear-doctrine.html" title="">said last month that he would lower the threshold</a> for his country’s use of those weapons. American and NATO officials have said that they have detected no preparations by Russia for their use but have sought to make clear to the Kremlin that the Western alliance, too, was prepared to use its nuclear weapons if necessary.</p><p>Just before the Nobel was announced, NATO <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_229447.htm?selectedLocale=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declared</a> that its annual nuclear exercise called “Steadfast Noon” would begin on Monday, involving 60 aircraft and 2,000 military personnel in Western Europe. A senior Biden administration official said in June that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/us/politics/us-nuclear-russia-china.html" title="">United States may be forced to expand its nuclear arsenal</a> because of threats from Russia and China.</p><p>And the United States is already in the midst of a decades-long modernization program for its nuclear arsenal that has been <a href="https://fas.org/publication/nuclear-weapons-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a> to cost some $1.7 trillion.</p><p>“The nuclear powers are modernizing and upgrading their arsenals,” the Nobel committee <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2024/press-release/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in announcing Friday’s prize. “New countries appear to be preparing to acquire nuclear weapons; and threats are being made to use nuclear weapons in ongoing warfare. At this moment in human history, it is worth reminding ourselves what nuclear weapons are: the most destructive weapons the world has ever seen.”</p><p>China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, while forming a stronger alliance with Russia, which has high-level nuclear technology. Mr. Putin has boasted that Russia’s next-generation hypersonic missiles — which have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/europe/russias-sarmat-missile-test.html" title="">shown mixed results in recent testing</a> — can deliver nuclear warheads to any point on the globe, evading any air defenses. </p><p>Both Russia and China are increasingly allied to Iran, which is considered perhaps a year away from being able to create a nuclear warhead to fit to a missile.</p><p>There are concerns that Russia might be willing to provide Tehran with nuclear technology in return for Iran’s continued support for Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Iran is already believed to have supplied sophisticated drones and short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.</p><p>North Korea is also part of the informal group of countries at odds with an American-led order, and it has an active nuclear-weapons program and increasingly sophisticated missiles.</p><p>But many analysts and officials believe that the most urgent risk stems from the war in Ukraine, where one nuclear superpower, the United States, is sending sophisticated weapons to back the country’s defense against the world’s other nuclear superpower, Russia. </p><p>When Russia was struggling earlier in the war, in the fall of 2022, U.S. officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/us/politics/biden-nuclear-russia-ukraine.html" title="">reportedly</a> believed there was an even chance that Mr. Putin might authorize nuclear weapons to be used in certain circumstances.</p><p>In a speech at the time, Mr. Putin raised the specter of renewed nuclear weapons use by referring to America’s bombing in World War II. </p><p>“The United States is the only country in the world to have used nuclear weapons twice, destroying the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” Mr. Putin said. “By the way, they set a precedent.”</p><p>It was a suggestion that Mr. Putin’s takeaway from the atomic bombs of 1945 was very different from that of the Nobel committee and the organization it honored on Friday. Rather than set a taboo for using nuclear weapons, Mr. Putin was suggesting, those bombings had opened the door to such weapons being used again.</p><p>The threat of Russia using nuclear weapons at the time was considered real enough that strong messages were passed to Moscow, by official channels and in person, by the C.I.A. director, William Burns, about the consequences.</p><p>Now, Western officials and analysts generally believe that Mr. Putin will not use nuclear weapons so long as his forces are making progress on the front line. They note that, were he to deploy such weapons, he could face backlash from key Russian partners like China, and that the battlefield advantage of using those weapons is not clear. </p><p>But the Kremlin has sought to keep the threat alive, especially as European leaders and the White House consider Ukraine’s urgent request to use long-range missiles provided by the West against targets deep inside Russian territory. Mr. Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/europe/putin-warning-nato-missiles.html" title="">said last month</a> that such a move would put his country “at war with NATO.”</p><p>And to further drive home the point, Mr. Putin announced later last month that Russia would adjust its doctrine defining when the country could use nuclear weapons. He said that Russia would treat “aggression against Russia by any nonnuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state” as a “joint attack on the Russian Federation.”</p><p>The Kremlin said the new language was meant as a “signal” warning Ukraine’s backers “about the consequences in the case of their participation in an attack on our country by various means.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad2"><div id="ad-2" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhiNzNhMjNjLTM5MzAtNTYzOS1iYTNkLTc1ZjY0ZmI2YzJmMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/11/world/nobel-peace-prize-winner#heres-how-the-peace-prize-nomination-process-works" data-source-id="100000009756475"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-specia"><img alt="Megan Specia" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/megan-specia/megan-specia-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/megan-specia/megan-specia-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/megan-specia/megan-specia-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-11T10:55:12.308Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 11, 2024, 6:55 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-specia" itemprop="name">Megan Specia</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhiNzNhMjNjLTM5MzAtNTYzOS1iYTNkLTc1ZjY0ZmI2YzJmMA=="><a href="#heres-how-the-peace-prize-nomination-process-works">Here’s how the Peace Prize nomination process works.</a></h2></div><p>It is always difficult to predict who might receive the Nobel Peace Prize, not least because the nomination process attracts several hundred nominees every year.</p><p>Since the Nobel Committee does not make public its top nominees, there is, inevitably, widespread speculation about who the winner might be. Lists of possible front-runners are often based on guesswork or information put out by those who nominated the person or group.</p><div><p>Any eligible nominator can put forward a candidate, and sometimes those nominees are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nobel-peace-prize-nominations.html" title="">contentious and not seriously considered</a>. Many candidates are nominated numerous times.</p><p>Nominators include academics, such as university rectors and chancellors, and professors of political and social science, history, philosophy, law and theology. Leaders of peace research institutes and institutes of foreign affairs can also nominate potential recipients, as can members of national assemblies, governments and international courts of law.</p><p>Others who can make nominations include previous Peace Prize laureates, board members of organizations and institutions that have received the award, present and past members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and former advisers of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.</p><p>There are few criteria for who can be nominated, but the selection process is a rigorous one that plays out over months, according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Secret deliberations begin in February, and the committee narrows the list to 20 to 30 candidates before conducting months of research.</p><p>The committee then makes its decision through a simple majority vote in October before announcing the laureate’s name. A ceremony is then held in December in Oslo, where the recipient delivers a lecture and receives the Nobel Prize medal, diploma and monetary award.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDVhNTM2N2MtZWI0Yi01YWQ4LTkwNTEtMjRlYWRhYzAwZWE2"><div id="d5a5367c-eb4b-5ad8-9051-24eadac00ea6" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/11/world/nobel-peace-prize-winner#d5a5367c-eb4b-5ad8-9051-24eadac00ea6"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel"><img alt="Lynsey Chutel" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/21/reader-center/author-lynsey-chutel/author-lynsey-chutel-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/21/reader-center/author-lynsey-chutel/author-lynsey-chutel-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/21/reader-center/author-lynsey-chutel/author-lynsey-chutel-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-11T10:48:47.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 11, 2024, 6:48 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div></div></div></div></div><p>The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons congratulated Nihon Hidankyo and described the hibakusha as “inspirational survivors” who “have worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the catastrophic impacts of nuclear weapons and push for their total elimination.”</p><p>The campaign, an international coalition of nongovernmental organizations, itself received the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE0ZmNhNmY0LTU3NTQtNWU1Yi1iZjZhLTE0MTM2MDQ1MDAyMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/11/world/nobel-peace-prize-winner#what-is-nihon-hidankyo-hibakusha-japan" data-source-id="100000009756434"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-specia"><img alt="Megan Specia" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/megan-specia/megan-specia-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/megan-specia/megan-specia-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/megan-specia/megan-specia-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel"><img alt="Lynsey Chutel" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/21/reader-center/author-lynsey-chutel/author-lynsey-chutel-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/21/reader-center/author-lynsey-chutel/author-lynsey-chutel-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/21/reader-center/author-lynsey-chutel/author-lynsey-chutel-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-11T10:46:48.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 11, 2024, 6:46 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-specia" itemprop="name">Megan Specia</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel" itemprop="name">Lynsey Chutel</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE0ZmNhNmY0LTU3NTQtNWU1Yi1iZjZhLTE0MTM2MDQ1MDAyMw=="><a href="#what-is-nihon-hidankyo-hibakusha-japan">The survivors became known as ‘bomb-affected people.’</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nagasaki Peace Park in southwestern Japan on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kyodo, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Some 200,000 people were killed when U.S. forces dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the summer of 1945, leveling large swaths of both Japanese cities. But many more survived, some with life-changing injuries, others bearing the terrible emotional scars of the devastation and death they had witnessed.</p><p>Those survivors became known as “hibakusha,” which translates as “bomb-affected people.”</p><div><p>Japan recognized about 650,000 survivors in the wake of the war, but as the decades pass, the number still living has dwindled, and many of those who remain are now in their 80s. About 114,000 are still alive, according to Nihon Hidankyo, the grass-roots organization that received the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.</p><p>Many of the survivors have dedicated their lives to recounting their stories of loss and excruciating physical and emotional injury. Their powerful testimony has contributed to a broader understanding of the profound devastation of nuclear war. This year, The New York Times’s Opinion section <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/06/opinion/hiroshima-nagasaki-atomic-bombing.html" title="">wrote about the survivors</a>.</p><p>Nihon Hidankyo, established 11 years after the end of World War II, began as an organization representing the survivors of the atomic bomb who continued to suffer not only the physical effects of radiation but also the social stigma associated with the war.</p><p>Nihon Hidankyo is the only nationwide group of those survivors in Japan, with members in all of the country’s 47 prefectures. In the decades since its founding, the group has sent survivors around the world to share their experiences of living with the effects of radiation exposure from an atomic bomb.</p><p>“Humanity must never again inflict nor suffer the sacrifice and torture we have experienced,” the group said in its founding statement in 1956.</p><p>During the ceremony for the 2005 Peace Prize — given to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear capabilities and reports to the United Nations — the Nobel committee also mentioned Nihon Hidankyo and the hibakusha for their work in campaigning against nuclear warfare.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad3"><div id="ad-3"
