The job came with a chauffeur-driven car, secretaries, a spacious office and a mahogany desk with a mother-of-pearl nameplate.</p><p>But Mr. Sohn has never been to South Hamgyeong, because it is in North Korea.</p><p>South Korea has never formally accepted the division of the Korean Peninsula, which was imposed by the United States and the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. (Neither has North Korea, for that matter.) To assert its claim, the South appoints its own governors for five provinces in the North.</p><p>A chart in Mr. Sohn’s office bears the names and photos of dozens of officials who would help him administer South Hamgyeong “should the day come.” That day would be when the two Koreas unify — a remote prospect, to say the least.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sohn Yang-Young, the appointed governor of South Hamgyeong Province, says his own grandchildren don’t share his passion for reunifying the Koreas. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Reaching South Hamgyeong would be a homecoming of sorts for Mr. Sohn, 73. It is the province his late parents fled during the Korean War and missed for the rest of their lives, which they spent in the South. North Korea has redrawn South Hamgyeong’s boundaries since the war, but the family’s roots remain.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I always keep myself ready to go up there to take over,” Mr. Sohn said in an interview at his office in <a href="https://www.ibuk5do.go.kr/main.do;jsessionid=sJScyQKXxnGZDuCtY06Dv_aqbbM31PFtoxxt5N8h.ibuk5do1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Committee for the Five northern Korean Provinces.</a> (The committee refuses to capitalize “northern” in its official English name, just as North Korea once referred to “south Korea.”)</p><p>Reunification is a deeply personal matter for millions of Koreans whose families came south during the war, and for the tens of thousands of North Koreans who defected more recently. Decades after Germany and Vietnam became whole after their wartime divisions, many still wait for Korea to take its turn.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Sohn, in his Seoul office, showing photos from the 1950 evacuation of civilians and United Nations troops from Hungnam, North Korea, during the Korean War.

He later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/world/asia/north-korea-reunification-policy.html" title="">called for</a> revising the North’s Constitution to remove all references to reunification, define the North as a separate Korean state and declare that it would annex South Korea, possibly using nuclear weapons, if the South should start a war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Wednesday, North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said the Supreme People’s Assembly, the North’s rubber-stamp Parliament, had revised the Constitution this week in accordance with Mr. Kim’s wishes, but it did not release the amended text.</p><p>In South Korea, more and more people — <a href="https://ipus.snu.ac.kr/blog/archives/news/9627" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially among the young</a> — say they <a href="https://www.kinu.or.kr/main/board/view.do?nav_code=mai1674793705&amp;code=XDXh8TgkVFNJ&amp;idx=24478" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oppose reunification</a>. Many cite the likely costs of integrating their capitalist economy with that of the impoverished, socialist North. </p><p>Mr. Sohn lamented that his own grandchildren didn’t share his passion for bringing the Koreas together.</p><p>“They don’t teach it at school,” he said. “The younger generations live in so much affluence and they are so inured to tensions with North Korea they don’t realize that the peace they enjoy is not permanent.”</p><p>In Mr. Sohn’s office, the dream is still alive and poignant. The committee he works for, created in 1949, operates from a quiet five-story building tucked into the foothills of northern Seoul. An arm of the South’s Home Ministry, it has a yearly budget of $7.2 million and pays each of its five governors an annual salary of $110,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The building in northern Seoul where Mr. Sohn and the other appointed governors work. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The South also has a Unification Ministry, which has served as a channel for dialogue with the North during the two sides’ occasional periods of détente. But the ministry’s North Korean counterpart, the National Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, was abolished by Mr. Kim this year.</p><p>Analysts have pondered questions like who would take over North Korea, and what would happen to its nuclear arsenal, should Mr. Kim’s regime implode in a coup or some other unforeseen event. But reunification has become a hollow slogan.</p><p>The Koreas have drifted apart politically, economically and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/world/asia/30iht-dialect.2644361.html" title="">even linguistically</a>. In recent years, they have aligned themselves more closely with opposing geopolitical blocs — the North with Russia and China, and the South with the United States and Japan.</p><p>Still, until Mr. Kim disavowed it, both sides had championed reunification as a sacrosanct goal. In the North, state propaganda preached it. In the South, pop songs that channeled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj-ynzx2cSw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the pain of the national divide</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQazL-qi2_Y" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the yearning for unification</a> became classics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>North Korean badges and medals on display in the building’s exhibition hall.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But each government claims the entire peninsula, and each rejects the other’s claim. Mr. Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the North’s first leader, tried to reunify the countries by force in 1950. Millions were killed before the Korean War was halted in a truce three years later. The two nations are technically still at war.</p><p>This year, Mr. Kim began removing the word tongil, which means reunification, from state propaganda and from the names of train stations. He has punished people for watching <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/world/asia/kim-jong-un-k-pop.html" title="">K-pop videos</a>, and in recent months his government has launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/north-korea-trash-balloons.html" title="">thousands of balloons to dump trash</a> on South Korea. On Wednesday, his military said it would “permanently shut off and block” the countries’ border by cutting off long-unused roads and railways <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/world/asia/north-korea-train-south.html" title="">built during a brief period of rapprochement</a>.</p><p>Ji Seong-ho, a 42-year-old North Korean defector who is the South Korean-appointed governor of North Hamgyeong, his native province, blames Mr. Kim for the fading interest in reunification.</p><p>“Once they lost the competition with South Korea, North Korean leaders realized that they could not support reunification because there would be no place for them in a unified Korea,” said Mr. Ji, who defected in 2006. “Kim Jong-un is helping South Koreans lose interest in reunification while discouraging his people from dreaming of a unified Korea.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Korea appointed Ji Seong-ho, who defected from North Korea in 2006, as governor of his native province, North Hamgyeong.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Still, Mr. Sohn, Mr. Ji and the other appointed governors try to keep hope alive. They attend meetings and social events aimed at supporting refugees from the North and preserving the prewar cultural heritage of their provinces, something they fear the communist regime in the North is neglecting.</p><p>In the lobby of the committee headquarters, a newsstand offers free newsletters published by provincial friendship associations. The provinces’ five flags stand in front of the building. A monument depicts two hands shaking in a symbol of unity.</p><p>Mr. Sohn’s family, like countless others, was divided by the war. His parents left a son and daughter behind when they left the North, boarding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/06/world/asia/korean-war-evacuation-afghanistan.html" title="">an American cargo ship</a> on which Mr. Sohn was born. His parents never saw his siblings again.</p><p>Mr. Ji said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/world/asia/north-korean-defector-trump.html" title="">his own life story</a> showed what a difference reunification could make for North Koreans.</p><p>He had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident, and the disability made him a social outcast in the North, forcing him to beg for food. But in the South, he attended college and served as a lawmaker before being appointed North Hamgyeong’s governor in August.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“The first thing I would do if I returned to the North as governor is to increase food rations for its starving people,” Mr. Ji said. “South Korea has so much rice in surplus that the rising cost of storing it has become a problem.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The “Statue of Reconciliation and Unification” outside the building.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div>
