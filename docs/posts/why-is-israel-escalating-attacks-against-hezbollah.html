They believed that if they increased the cost of Hezbollah’s campaign, it would be easier for foreign diplomats, like Amos Hochstein, a senior United States envoy, to convince the group to stand down.</p><p>For now, the opposite has happened. Despite days of escalatory attacks from Israel, Hezbollah has pledged not to buckle under the pressure.</p><p>The group’s leaders have said they will continue their attacks until a cease-fire is agreed to in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, the militia’s ally. And on Sunday morning, Hezbollah fired dozens of missiles at targets roughly thirty miles inside Israel, their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-conflict.html" title="">deepest strikes</a> since the start of the war in October — which one of its top officials warned was “just the beginning.”</p><p>Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, has even dared Israel to invade southern Lebanon, a move that could just as plausibly lead to a protracted stalemate as an Israeli victory.</p><p>An invasion did not appear to be imminent on Monday, even as Israel intensified its strikes and warned civilians to evacuate villages where it said Hezbollah was storing weapons. Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the current focus was on an aerial campaign, not a ground operation.</p><p>But if Israel runs short of other forms of military pressure, an invasion would be one of the few military options left to the country’s leadership.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
