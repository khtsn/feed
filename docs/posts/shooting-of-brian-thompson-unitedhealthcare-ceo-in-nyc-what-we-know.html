The company, which is based in a Minneapolis suburb, is a unit of UnitedHealth Group, whose market valuation of $560 billion makes it one of the country’s largest publicly traded companies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Thompson spent more than 20 years rising through the ranks at UnitedHealthcare, which offers insurance to companies and individuals, employs about 140,000 people and had $281 billion in revenue in 2023.</p><p>He received total compensation of $10.2 million last year, with $1 million in base pay augmented by substantial cash and stock grants. The company’s profits rose on his watch, jumping to more than $16 billion last year from $12 billion in 2021.</p><p>But amid the growth, the company and its parent also attracted scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators who accused them of systematically refusing to authorize health care procedures and treatments.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group’s size and scope have attracted the attention of the Justice Department, which is examining whether it has engaged in anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>According to regulatory filings, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/health/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare.html" title="">Mr. Thompson owned about $20 million of UnitedHealth Group shares</a> as of late September. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/unitedhealth-unh-executives-sold-stock-before-us-probe-became-public" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> in April that he was one of several company executives who sold shares before the Justice Department antitrust investigation was disclosed to investors — about $15 million worth, in Mr. Thompson’s case. The company told Bloomberg at the time that the sales had been approved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Before joining UnitedHealthcare, Mr. Thompson spent nearly seven years at the accounting and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, now known as PwC.</p><p>He graduated from the University of Iowa with an accounting degree in 1997 and lived in a Minneapolis suburb with his wife, Paulette R. Thompson, a physical therapist, and two children.</p><h2 id="link-4035af26">Why was he in Manhattan?</h2><p>The shooting occurred as Mr. Thompson arrived early at the hotel to prepare for a UnitedHealthcare investors’ day gathering.</p><p>Such events, which are common for publicly traded companies, give major shareholders and analysts who track the companies a chance to hear from executives and pepper them with questions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The New York Hilton Midtown, one of New York City’s largest hotels, is in a busy tourist area, close to the Museum of Modern Art and Rockefeller Center, where the famous Christmas tree was scheduled to be lit Wednesday night.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>UnitedHealthcare C.E.O. Killed in ‘Brazen, Targeted Attack,’ Police Say</h2><h4>The police are searching for the suspect in the fatal shooting of Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare, near a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Wednesday morning.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>In Midtown Manhattan early this morning, 50-year-old Brian Thompson, the C.E.O. of UnitedHealthcare, was shot and killed in what appears at this early stage of our investigation to be a brazen, targeted attack. The suspect approached from behind and fired several rounds, striking the victim at least once in the back and at least once in the right calf.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/04/multimedia/-04vid-Midtown-Shooting-TOS/-04vid-Midtown-Shooting-TOS--superJumbo-v3.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The police are searching for the suspect in the fatal shooting of Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare, near a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Wednesday morning.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-125aaac9">How did the shooting unfold?</h2><p>The killer, according to images released by the police and security-camera footage, was a man wearing a dark hooded jacket, a gray backpack and a mask covering the bottom of his face.</p><p>Apparently knowing which door Mr. Thompson planned to enter, the shooter arrived outside the hotel about 10 minutes before his intended target and ignored passers-by as he lay in wait.</p><p>As Mr. Thompson, in a blue suit, walked toward the hotel entrance, the shooter approached him from behind and fired at least three shots with a pistol that appeared to be fitted with a silencer. The pistol jammed during the shooting, but the gunman cleared the jam quickly and continued firing.</p><p>Struck by the bullets, Mr. Thompson took several steps, turned to face his assailant and then collapsed on the sidewalk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>With his victim crumpled against a wall, the shooter walked toward him slowly. He seemed to point the gun at Mr. Thompson one more time, then walked away. He began to run only as he was crossing the street.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jessica Tisch, the police commissioner, said officers “would not rest” until the gunman was in custody.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

Several images released by the police from inside the coffee shop showed what appeared to be a man dressed the same way as the shooter.</p><p>The attacker’s means of escape could also offer clues. Citi Bike riders must use a debit or credit card to unlock a bicycle, and the dock locations and times at which bikes are removed and returned are also recorded.</p><p>Investigators were also examining Mr. Thompson’s background for signs of a possible motive.</p><p>He had recently received several threats, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation; the source and precise nature of the threats was unclear.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ed-shanahan">More about Ed Shanahan</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
