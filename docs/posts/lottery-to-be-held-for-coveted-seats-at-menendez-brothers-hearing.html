It may not be what you think.</p><p>A lottery is being held on Monday to determine who will be the 16 people who get to witness what happens next in the case of the Menendez Brothers, who are serving life sentences for murdering their parents in 1989.</p><p>The drawing will take place between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. Pacific time, in front of the Van Nuys Courthouse West, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County said. The seats for 16 people, in a county of more than 10 million residents, will be allocated just one hour before the status hearing is set to begin at 10:30 a.m.</p><p>The court occasionally holds public lotteries “when seating is limited and public interest is high,” a court spokesperson said in an email.</p><p>The high level of interest in the case is in part spurred by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/television/menendez-brothers-netflix-monsters.html" title="">a new series</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/arts/television/menendez-brothers-netflix-takeaways.html" title="">new documentary</a> on Netflix that detail the brothers’ abuse allegations against their parents. Erik and Lyle Menendez killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, more than 35 years ago in their Beverly Hills mansion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Menendez brothers were found guilty of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. At the time, the judge said that he sentenced each brother to two consecutive life sentences <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/us/menendez-brothers-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.html" title="">because they had carefully decided</a> to kill their parents.</p><p>In the almost three decades since, the public perception of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were 21 and 18 when they committed the murders, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/arts/true-crime-boom-menendez-brothers.html" title="">has shifted</a> somewhat. Many have shown their interest in the murders in social media posts, and have often pushed for the brothers’ release, with the renewed attention <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/style/menendez-brothers-social-media-defenders.html" title="">earning them a new class of defenders</a>.</p><p>Last month, the Los Angeles County district attorney, George Gascón, said he would request that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/menendez-brothers-prison-sentence.html" title="">the brothers be resentenced</a>, which could ultimately lead <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/menendez-brothers-case.html" title="">to their release</a>.</p><p>“I came to a place where I believe that under the law, resentencing is appropriate,” said Mr. Gascón, who has since lost his seat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The brothers could also find freedom through clemency from California’s governor, for which they have petitioned. Gov. Gavin Newsom has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/menendez-brothers-newsom-clemency.html" title="">said he would hold off</a> on considering that request until the new district attorney, Nathan Hochman, takes office early next month and has had a chance to review the case.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
