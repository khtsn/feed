His decision not to seek a third term will set the stage for another key contest next year in a state that will already have a wide-open governor’s race, with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer departing because of term limits.</p><p>Mr. Peters had served as the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the last two election cycles.</p><p>“I always thought there would be a time that I would step aside and pass the reins for the next generation,” Mr. Peters told <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/28/michigan-democratic-senator-gary-peters-will-not-run-for-reelection-to-us-senate-seat-2026/77985876007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Detroit News</a>. “I also never saw service in Congress as something you do your whole life.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At 66, Mr. Peters is relatively young for a senator stepping down, but he had also previously served for three terms in the House. He also served in the Navy Reserve.</p><p>He released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi29He-JpsE&amp;t=5s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video about his choice</a> on Tuesday morning, saying that the “most important chapter in my life is a work in progress,” including being a new grandfather.</p><p>The path for Democrats to take back the Senate in 2026 was already steep. Republicans now hold a 53-seat majority, and with Vice President JD Vance serving as the tiebreaking vote, Democrats would need to win four seats.</p><p>The party has few pickup opportunities and is already set to defend the seat of Senator Jon Ossoff in Georgia.</p><p>Democrats successfully held a Democratic seat in Michigan last year, when Elissa Slotkin, then a Democratic House member, defeated former Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican. It was one of the most closely fought races in the nation, with Ms. Slotkin prevailing by fewer than 20,000 votes and roughly 0.3 percentage points.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
