That act of violence, caught on video, inspired national outrage and worldwide protests against police violence targeting Black Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It also resulted in a withering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/doj-report-minneapolis-police.html" title="">federal report</a> that found that the Minneapolis Police Department had routinely discriminated against Black and Native American people and had used deadly force without justification. After nearly two years of negotiations, the Justice Department and the city submitted an agreement to the court in January calling for federal oversight of the Police Department’s efforts to address the issues.</p><p>That arrangement, known as a consent decree, was similar to court-approved agreements between the federal government and at least 13 other cities whose police forces have been accused of widespread civil rights abuses, including Los Angeles, Newark and Ferguson, Mo.</p><p>The decrees set requirements for how officers should be trained and disciplined, with an outside monitor and a judge to ensure compliance, sometimes for years. Consent decrees do not go into effect until they are approved by a federal judge, and a judge would have to approve any motion to dismiss a case.</p><p>The Trump administration contends that the decrees are too punitive. “Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, said on Wednesday.</p><p>The Minneapolis arrangement had yet to take effect, and the consent decree with Louisville was also awaiting a judge’s approval. The Police Department there was investigated after the killing of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old medical worker who was shot in 2020 during the botched execution of a search warrant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Leaders in Minneapolis and Louisville had been expecting the Trump administration’s actions, which are sure to be met with consternation by leaders of the movement for racial justice that the murder of Mr. Floyd murder accelerated. The anniversary of his death is expected to be marked in Minneapolis this weekend with remembrances and vigils.</p><p>Officials in Minneapolis have said that they would go ahead with the overhaul measures promised in the agreement, whether or not there was federal oversight. Since 2023, the city has also been party to a separate court-enforced <a href="https://mn.gov/mdhr/mpd/agreement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreement with the state of Minnesota</a> to address race-based policing.</p><p>Still, proponents of consent decrees say that nothing works quite as well as federal oversight has. The agreements have been among the federal government’s most potent tools for overhauling law enforcement agencies that have been accused of civil rights abuses, experts say, and can result in lasting change.</p><p>Despite that, some cities, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/memphis-justice-oversight-police-department.html" title="">Memphis</a> and <a href="https://www.kjzz.org/kjzz-news/2024-08-27/phoenix-hasnt-signed-a-consent-degree-over-police-no-one-knows-how-long-the-doj-will-wait" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>, have resisted entering into such agreements, even after <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-06/Phoenix%20Findings%20Report%20Final%20-%20Final%20508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scathing</a> Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1379096/dl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> that detailed histories of abuses and misconduct. Officials in those cities have said they could fix problems on their own, without federal oversight.</p><p>“On the one hand, consent decrees can be onerous, bureaucratic and costly,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a research group in Washington. “And on the other hand, the irony is that cities that most need help to update their policies and training would not get the resources without the federal consent decree.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He added that the agreements had enabled police chiefs in several cities to access federal money for policy updates and additional training.</p><p>Federal oversight of state and local police departments came into being during the Clinton administration, when <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/law-enforcement-misconduct-statute-42-usc-14141" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legislation was passed</a> in response to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/18/us/seven-minutes-los-angeles-special-report-videotaped-beating-officers-puts-full.html" title="">beating of Rodney King</a> by the Los Angeles police in 1991. But support for oversight has seesawed depending on which party has held the White House.</p><p>Several major cities negotiated consent decrees with the Obama administration, prompted in part by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/us/thousands-march-in-washington-to-protest-deaths-by-police.html" title="">widespread protests</a> over police killings of unarmed Black people. The agreements called on officers to form partnerships with community groups <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/833431/download" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Ferguson</a>, receive training on de-escalation tactics <a href="https://consentdecree.baltimorecity.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Baltimore</a> and work to develop unbiased policing policies <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2015/05/27/cleveland_agreement_5-26-15.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Cleveland</a>.</p><p>The first Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/sessions-limits-consent-decrees.html" title="">limited the use of consent decrees</a>, but those restrictions were rescinded under the Biden administration. On the campaign trail last year, Mr. Trump repeatedly said that he wanted to give officers “immunity from prosecution, so they’re not prosecuted for doing their job.”</p><p>Mr. Trump paved the way for Wednesday’s announcement last month, when he signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-and-unleashing-americas-law-enforcement-to-pursue-criminals-and-protect-innocent-citizens/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to review all federal consent decrees and to “modify, rescind or move to conclude” them within 60 days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis has said that his city remains committed to major changes that the Police Department adopted after Mr. Floyd’s killing. Those reforms include policies seeking to limit the use of force, improve training and restore residents’ trust.</p><p>“We will implement every reform outlined in the consent decree,” he said in a statement, “because accountability isn’t optional.”</p><p>Shaila Dewan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacey Fortin covers a wide range of subjects for the National desk of The Times, including extreme weather, court cases and state politics all across the country.</p></div><div><p>Devlin Barrett covers the Justice Department and the F.B.I. for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ernesto Londoño is a Times reporter based in Minnesota, covering news in the Midwest and drug use and counternarcotics policy.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
