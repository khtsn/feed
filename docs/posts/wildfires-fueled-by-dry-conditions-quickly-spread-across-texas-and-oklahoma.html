Preliminary reports showed that at least three people had died in crashes in the Amarillo region, according to Sgt. Cindy Barkley with the Texas Department of Public Safety.</p><p>Images on social media showed a dystopian view of the area. Emergency workers were battling a heavy dust storm as they went car by car looking for anyone trapped inside. A man taking one of the videos could be heard saying, “You want to go to Mars? This is Mars.”</p><p>Power outages were spreading as the fires burned. More than 124,000 customers were without power across northern Texas and parts of Oklahoma as of Friday afternoon, according to <a href="https://poweroutage.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poweroutage.us.</a> The authorities warned that rolling blackouts were a possibility to avoid fires caused by downed power lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Angela Morland, the owner of Cactus Inn &amp; RV Parking in McLean, Texas, a motel built in the 1950s, said in a phone interview that she had been ordered to evacuate with her guests on Friday afternoon. She was staying in the basement of a Methodist church about 20 miles away. Many people had gotten rooms at her motel to seek refuge from the highway winds.</p><p>“Go east,” Ms. Morland, 57, said she told her guests when she learned they had to leave.</p><p>Ms. Morland said she could smell the fire when she packed into her vehicle with her dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Stella, and a stranger. She said about 50 other evacuees were staying with her in the church basement.</p><p>“I was frightened,” she said.</p><p>Alanreed, another small community in Gray County, about 60 miles east of Amarillo, was also advised to evacuate on Friday because of the threat of fire, said Dustin Miller, an emergency management spokesman for the city of Pampa, the county seat. He said that wind gusts in the area had reached 101 miles per hour, diminishing visibility and making travel treacherous.</p><p>“It’s dying down slowly, but not enough,” Mr. Miller said.</p><p>He said there were no injuries or property damage reported as of Friday afternoon in the county. But at least two semi-trucks had flipped over on Interstate 40.</p><p>Fast-spreading fires were not the only danger in some places. Strong gusts caused severe damage to the <a href="https://www.koco.com/article/damage-reported-new-cordell-power-shut-off-prevent-wildfire/64188899?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Washita County Courthouse</a> in New Cordell, Okla., Friday afternoon, spreading debris around the area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Officials had been anticipating the fierce storms. On Thursday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas directed the Division of Emergency Management to deploy all necessary resources to the affected areas ahead of the wildfires.</p><p>“With dry conditions, wind gusts and low humidity increasing wildfire danger, Texans are encouraged to make an emergency plan, limit any activities that can cause a spark, and heed the guidance of local officials to keep yourself and your family safe,” he said in a statement.</p><p>Much of North Texas remained under a red-flag warning Friday afternoon, which is issued when dry weather and gusty winds are likely to spread wildfires.</p><p>The Panhandle, a sparsely populated area, is no stranger to fire disasters. A year ago, downed power lines ignited a wildfire <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/texas-smokehouse-creek-fire.html" title="">known as the Smokehouse Creek fire</a>, which burned more than a million acres, consuming houses, scorching vast ranch lands and killing livestock.
