He was 70.</p><p>His death was confirmed by his longtime friend Dorian Hannaway on Tuesday. She did not cite a cause.</p><p>Mr. Page, a St. Louis native, burst onto the New York theater scene in 1975 as a replacement actor for the Lion in “The Wiz,” but it was his <a href="https://x.com/kevinddaly/status/1841114672423899633" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showstopping rendition</a> of “Sit Down, You’re Rockin’ the Boat” as Nicely-Nicely Johnson in the “Guys and Dolls” revival the next year that first drew acclaim.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ken Page in “Cats” in 2010. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Muny</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Sometimes it really does happen. Sometimes the fairy tale comes true,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/23/archives/new-jersey-weekly-new-face-the-guy-whos-rocking-the-boat-tickets.html" title="">The New York Times wrote in 1976.</a> “It happened on Wednesday night at the Broadway Theater to a young unknown, Ken Page.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He was in the original Broadway productions of “Cats,” as the dignified Old Deuteronomy, and “Ain’t Misbehavin,’” among <a href="https://playbill.com/person/ken-page-vault-0000048030" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many other theater credits</a>. Offstage, he was probably best known for voicing the infamous boogeyman in Henry Selick and Tim Burton’s 1993 stop motion classic, “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” Oogie Boogie. It was a role that Mr. Page would revisit often in video games and Halloween celebrations.</p><p>According to a statement released by his agent, Mr. Page was preparing for upcoming appearances as Oogie Boogie when he died.</p><p>Ms. Hannaway said Mr. Page loved playing Oogie Boogie. Visitors can still hear his voice booming from speakers at the Haunted House and California Adventure in theme parks that are now decorated for Halloween.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On the set of “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” a stop motion musical fantasy film by Tim Burton</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Touchstone Picture/Sunset Boulevard, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He also co-starred with Beyoncé in “Dreamgirls,” as Max Washington.

As a teenager, I loved Motown,” he said, adding that at the time the records he liked most “are those that aren’t so overly pasteurized by the studio that they lose a feeling of energy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ken Page in a performance of “My Fair Lady” in 2001.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Muny</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Page, speaking to the paper ahead of a showcase performance, said: “I consider Tina Turner to be the godmother of rock and soul. I’d love to be able to create that kind of excitement. I also like Lionel Richie, who’s very polished, but still energetic. Where I want to go is somewhere between the two.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>His career began at the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre, known as The Muny. He appeared in more than 45 shows at the theater, most recently as the Bishop of Digne in their 2024 production of “Les Misérables.”</p><p>“Since 2013, he served as ‘The Voice of The Muny,’ his singular baritone welcoming audience members before each performance,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/munytheatre/videos/973295131479494" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a statement</a> from The Muny.</p><p>Alec Baldwin, who met Mr. Page in 1983, said in a statement that the actor was “the rare combination, one of the nicest and among the most talented people I have ever met.”</p><p>”We stayed in close touch always — he just texted me last week sending me sunshine and good vibes,” he said. “He sent me pictures of his garden and his flowers.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
