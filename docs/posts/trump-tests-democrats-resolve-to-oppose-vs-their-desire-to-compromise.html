Rather than cede any ground to Republicans, he has used high-profile appearances to raise alarms about an administration that he compares to the rise of Nazism in Germany.</p><p>“Americans are experiencing the cruelty that comes with authoritarian rule,” he said. “I wish there were more people, more elected leaders, community leaders, who would step up and speak out.”</p><p>Still, simply resisting Mr. Trump is not enough for Democrats to win in the future, he said.</p><p>“We have to call out the B.S. that Republicans have been selling,” he said. “Meanwhile, Democrats have to make people’s lives better.”</p><p>On that point, at least, all three of the governors seem to agree.</p><p>“We’ve got to offer them something,” Mr. Walz said.</p><p>“Exactly,” Mr. Newsom replied. “That’s the soul-searching that we need.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Katie Glueck is a Times national political reporter.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-glueck">More about Katie Glueck</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Lisa Lerer is a national political reporter for The Times, based in New York.
