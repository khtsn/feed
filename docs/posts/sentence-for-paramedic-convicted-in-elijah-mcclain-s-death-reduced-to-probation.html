Mr. McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, died after a confrontation with Aurora, Colo., police, in which officers put him in a chokehold and a paramedic injected him with ketamine.</p><p>Mr. Cichuniec was the supervisor of the paramedic who gave what prosecutors said was an excessive amount of the powerful sedative. In March, Judge Mark Warner of Adams County District Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/us/paramedic-sentenced-elijah-mcclain.html" title="">sentenced Mr. Cichuniec to five years</a> in prison, the statutory minimum.</p><p>On Friday, the judge said that he had reduced the sentence because of “unusual and extenuating circumstances,” <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/09/13/elijah-mcclain-paramedic-sentence-cichuniec/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to The Denver Post</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prosecutors, who tried the five police officers and paramedics involved in Mr. McClain’s death, called the decision disappointing.</p><p>“After considering the evidence, a statewide grand jury indicted Cichuniec, and a jury of his peers found him guilty of his criminal acts that led to the death of Elijah McClain,” the Colorado Attorney General’s Office said in a statement. “We are disappointed the court reduced his sentence today, but we respect the court’s decision.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
