Guggenheim Museum’s landmark 1959 building, <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/about-us/architecture/frank-lloyd-wright-and-the-guggenheim" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designed by Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, has always presented singular opportunities for living artists to engage with its sculptural spiraling ramp and central oculus illuminated by a domed skylight.</p><p>“It’s an institution that gives agency to solo exhibitions in ways unlike any other museum,” <a href="https://www.davidkordanskygallery.com/artist/rashid-johnson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Rashid Johnson</a>, the multidisciplinary artist who served on the Guggenheim’s board from 2016 to 2023. “It’s a collaboration between the artist and inherently the architect.”</p><p>Next spring, Johnson will get to take on the entirety of Wright’s dramatic rotunda in a midcareer survey that opens April 18 and remains on view through Jan. 18, 2026. Titled “A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” it will include almost 90 works in photography, video, film, mixed-media paintings, sculpture and installation that scale the space and explore themes of identity, social alienation and rebirth in ways both political and deeply personal.</p><p>Johnson, 47, is one of the most influential voices of his generation and has expanded the cultural conversation around race in America through his art, advocacy and institutional stewardship. He stepped down as a Guggenheim trustee last year before proceeding with plans for this show to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.</p></div></div><div><p>(Similarly, Kasseem Dean, the producer and D.J. known as Swizz Beatz, resigned from the board of the Brooklyn Museum before its exhibition “Giants: Art From the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys” went on view this year.)</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Johnson’s “Untitled Escape Collage” (2018).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martin Parsekian, via Rashid Johnson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Johnson, who is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/style/rashid-johnson-sheree-hovsepian-hamptons-party.html" title="">a major collector</a> and continues to serve on the boards of <a href="https://performa2023.org/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Performa</a> and <a href="https://www.ballroommarfa.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ballroom Marfa</a>, was originally recruited to the Guggenheim’s board by the former director Richard Armstrong. Johnson served on the Art and Museum Committee and was particularly invested in the expansion of the internship program. He said that the Guggenheim played “a special role in my arts education” and that he hoped his contribution there had been substantive.</p><p>The survey is organized by Naomi Beckwith, the Guggenheim’s deputy director and chief curator, and Andrea Karnes, the chief curator at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas. It will travel to the Fort Worth museum after the Guggenheim.</p><p>Beckwith and Johnson are longtime friends who were both raised and educated in Chicago. “We called ourselves long-lost cousins because there was a real familiarity in the root sense,” Beckwith said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>She was already in conversation with the artist about a possible project in her former role as curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, which originated <a href="https://mcachicago.org/exhibitions/2012/rashid-johnson-message-to-our-folks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Johnson’s first traveling museum show in 2012</a>. Pointing to the Guggenheim’s history of working with artists inspired by and contending with Wright’s building in daring ways, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17seghal-t.html" title="">Tino Sehgal</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/21/arts/art-review-free-to-play-and-be-gooey.html" title="">Matthew Barney</a>, Beckwith said she was excited “for the museum to return to form and invite an artist who had the ambition of really working with the architecture.”</p><p>Johnson’s first prominent public debut, shortly after graduating from Columbia College in Chicago, was in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/11/arts/art-review-a-full-studio-museum-show-starts-with-28-young-artists-and-a-shoehorn.html" title="">Thelma Golden’s “Freestyle” exhibition</a> at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2001, an opening salvo for a younger generation of Black artists asking for a more nuanced look at their work through the frame of art history as well as race. (Johnson went on to get his M.F.A. at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.)</p><p>For the upcoming survey, Beckwith said, “we wanted to think about an exhibition that allowed Rashid to kind of walk through these social histories that have unfolded over the last couple decades” — the elevation of Black voices in the art world and beyond — “but also allowed a kind of grace for him to be a feeling and thinking human being.”</p><p>The show takes its title from a poem by the writer and activist Amiri Baraka, a recurring reference in Johnson’s work. A new film by Johnson titled “Sanguine,” which will premiere in a <a href="https://www.hauserwirth.com/hauser-wirth-exhibitions/rashid-johnson/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">solo show at Hauser &amp; Wirth in Paris beginning Oct. 14</a>, explores intergenerational relationships between the artist’s father, himself and his son, and includes excerpts from “A Poem for Deep Thinkers” spoken by Baraka.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Sanguine,” a film by Johnson that explores intergenerational relationships, will premier in a Paris show in October before being displayed at the Guggenheim. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rashid Johnson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>At the Guggenheim, “Sanguine” will be displayed inside a new site-specific installation of the same name. Modular black steel scaffolding will rise floor to ceiling on facing sides of the Guggenheim’s top ramp and contain potted plants, grow lights, sculpted shea butter busts, books, ceramics and alcoves for the film, for painting and for a working piano. It will serve as an improvisational performance space for a wide range of invited artists, as will a second site-specific stage installation Johnson is planning for the rotunda floor.</p></div><div><div><p>“Living plants housed in gridded armatures help facilitate a conversation around empathy and issues of care and how they help navigate certain kinds of architectural spaces,” Johnson said. He will suspend a flurry of palm trees and other plants on wires anchored to both sides of “Sanguine” that will descend into the space of the oculus like a heavenly garden cascading toward earth.</p><p>“It’s such an enormous kind of volume,” he added. “To leave it unmolested wasn’t an option for me. It needed to be interrupted by some intervention.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>C</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>2</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Examining a Career  That Plumbs Identity<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Art and Museums in New York City</h2><h3>A guide to the shows, exhibitions and artists shaping the city’s cultural landscape.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Odd Duck of Antiguan Art: </strong>At the Drawing Center in Manhattan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/arts/design/frank-walter-drawing-center.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-art-nyc&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">the revival of the Antiguan artist Frank Walter</a> continues with a stack of his written archive displayed alongside his paintings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bronx Museum’s Executive Director Leaves: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/arts/design/bronx-museum-klaudio-rodriguez.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-art-nyc&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Klaudio Rodriguez is leaving his position</a> at the museum, which<strong> </strong>recently began a $33 million expansion and renovation project, to lead the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Man on Wire,’ Fifty Years Later: </strong>The high-wire artist Philippe Petit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/arts/philippe-petit-world-trade-center-50.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-art-nyc&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">has a new show</a> commemorating the 50th anniversary of his walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pacita Abad Across Continents: </strong>The Filipino American artist is having her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/arts/design/stitch-by-stitch-pacita-abad-crossed-continents-and-cultures.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-art-nyc&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">first retrospective at MoMA PS1</a> as the mainstream art world finally catches up to her work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Looking For More Art?:</strong> Here are the gallery shows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/arts/design/nyc-galleries-august.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-art-nyc&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">not to miss in August</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div>
