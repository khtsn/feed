    <h1>With Days to Go, Trump Courts Apolitical Young Men</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Donald Trump and Kamala Harris headed into the final weekend of what appears to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">an extremely tight race</a> by holding events across the Midwestern battleground states. They also waged national media campaigns to try to win over small but crucial groups of voters who have yet to make up their minds.</p><p>The Trump campaign has been particularly focused on appealing to young men, especially those without college degrees. There are millions of them, and they are less likely than other groups to vote or participate in politics at all.</p><p>Trump’s team believes he will secure a large portion of the votes of young men who do turn out. The former president has sought out podcasts and influencers popular with Gen Z, and the strategy appears to be paying off: My colleagues interviewed dozens of young men and heard that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-young-men.html" title="">many have been swayed by Trump’s bravado</a> and disdain for cultural norms, if not by policy.</p><p>“Some of these young men say they are traditionally moderate or even liberal,” our politics reporter Kellen Browning said. “But they say that they feel increasingly fed up with the Democratic Party, and that they don’t really align with its values anymore.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Harris maintains a lead among young voters overall, and even with young men in some surveys. Her campaign has also made some efforts to reach young men, including by sending Tim Walz, the vice-presidential nominee, to football games. But some said the outreach by the Harris team felt inauthentic.</p><p><strong>In other politics news:</strong></p><ul><li><p>U.S. spy agencies warned that Russia was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/russia-election-misinformation.html" title="">behind two recent videos</a> designed to undermine confidence in the election.</p></li><li><p>The White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/biden-garbage-transcript.html" title="">altered the official transcript</a> of President Biden’s remarks this week about the Trump campaign and “garbage.”</p></li><li><p>The fight for the House is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/elections/house-election-republicans-democrats.html" title="">on a knife’s edge</a>.

Ukraine is losing territory in the east, and its forces inside Russia have been partly pushed back. As a result, some U.S. officials have become pessimistic about Ukraine’s ability to stop Russian advances.</p><p>Ukraine’s main disadvantage, which had long been its weapons supplies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">now appears to be its troops</a>. The Pentagon assesses that Ukraine has enough soldiers to fight for six to 12 more months. After that, it will face a steep shortage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karl Russell</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-6af43da5">Job growth stalled last month</h2><p>American employers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/business/economy/jobs-report-october.html" title="">added only 12,000 jobs in October</a>, the Labor Department reported today. October was battered by a major strike and two hurricanes, making it unclear whether the slowdown was a temporary blip or a sign of a more significant slowdown. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent.</p><p>Donald Trump seized on the weak result and claimed that the report was a reflection of “how badly Kamala Harris broke our economy.” The White House argued that it was an anomaly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mud covered much of Paiporta, Spain, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nacho Doce/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo illustration by Pablo Delcan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-1eca0b48">What if A.I. is actually good for Hollywood?</h2><p>Three decades after starring together in “Forrest Gump,” Tom Hanks and Robin Wright reunited onscreen in “Here.” The film, which arrived in theaters today, follows a couple from age 18 into their 80s. It also showcases the remarkable capabilities of artificial intelligence, morphing the faces of Hanks and Wright as their characters age.</p><p>For now, much of Hollywood is weary of A.I., particularly its potential to replace human jobs. But the writer Devin Gordon suggests that the technology <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/magazine/ai-hollywood-movies-cgi.html" title="">might benefit the industry more than we realize.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-39c27097">To achieve big goals, think small</h2><p>The New York City Marathon is on Sunday, when thousands of runners will set out to conquer 26.2 miles on foot. For many, it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/sports/nyc-marathon-mental-game.html" title="">as much of a mental challenge as a physical one</a>.</p><p>My colleague Talya Minsberg, who is running the race for her 10th time, found that real-life lessons can be learned during a marathon. She noticed that focusing on incremental steps — like simply making it to mile 10, then focusing on mile 13 — can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/well/how-to-achieve-goals.html" title="">make broader goals much easier to achieve</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oliver Parini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Testani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><h2 id="link-2e597739">A picture worth a thousand snails</h2><p>To tell the story of a woman who hoards to shield herself from grief in his stop-motion film, “Memoir of a Snail,” Adam Elliot used more than 5,000 snail-related items. Every member of the production helped hand craft each snail — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/movies/memoir-of-a-snail-adam-elliot.html" title="">using nothing but paper, clay, wire and paint</a>. It took an entire day to set up the scene above.</p><p>The film, which is now in theaters, is dedicated to Elliot’s mother, whom he referred to as a “mild hoarder.” But after the painstaking process was complete, he said: “There were days I’d wished I’d written a film about a minimalist!”</p><p>Have a meticulous weekend.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
