Her son Nick Vassos, 34, is cheering for his mother — up to a point.</p><p>“Any of the physical intimacy pieces, I’m not there for,” he said. “I understand human nature, I understand needs, I understand what happens on the show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brenden Martin and his mother, Faith Martin.

There is also the joy of seeing their parent rekindle their romantic life, the anxiety of seeing them enter the unforgiving world of reality TV fame and the protectiveness that arises when they see their parent get rejected.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Zack Chazin first watched with pride as his mother, Leslie Fhima, won over audiences and the lead of “The Golden Bachelor.” In the season finale, that all came crashing to a halt.</p><p>“She gets dumped on TV,” Mr. Chazin, 38, said. “I was really upset.”</p><p>The breakup came after Mr. Chazin and the rest of his family had met the Golden Bachelor, Gerry Turner. Despite feeling confident about his mother’s connection with Mr. Turner, Mr. Chazin soon found himself helping his mother process a breakup while navigating negative commentary about her online.</p><p>In retrospect, he said, “I don’t know if I would want her to have done it.”</p><p>There is something about the very phenomenon of adults watching their parents date that has led TV producers to latch on with glee.</p><p>In 2022, Max put out a lone season of a dating show called “My Mom, Your Dad,” in which single parents moved into a house to flirt and couple up with one another. (Unknown to them, their college-aged children were watching from a control room, sometimes even pulling the puppet strings of their relationships.) The concept has been more successful in Britain, where the second season of <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/my-mum-your-dad" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“My Mum, Your Dad”</a> started this week.</p><p>Maria Lopiano, a 51-year-old radio presenter who appears on the second season with her 18-year-old daughter, said she was first drawn to the show as a viewer because of how it flipped the common dynamic of a parent disapproving of a child’s choice of a romantic partner. On “My Mum, Your Dad,” it was the child who was aghast at his or her parent’s choices — for example, a mother showing interest in a man her child immediately pegged as a womanizer.</p><p>“You knew that if it was the other way, they would be telling their daughter: ‘What are you doing? What do you see in that man?’” Ms. Lopiano said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When she joined this season’s cast, her daughter, Livia, who was in another room watching a video feed of her mother flirting with potential suitors, was suddenly in the novel position of disapproving of her mother’s choices.</p><p>“I think she just doesn’t think before she speaks,” Livia observed in a recent interview. “I think sometimes she just scares the men off.”</p><p>The potential for secondhand embarrassment is ratcheted up significantly in the infamous TLC series “MILF Manor,” in which women in their 40s and 50s aren’t merely dating on television — they’re dating men who can be decades younger than them.</p><p>On Season 2 of “MILF Manor” — which gained fame in part because of the title’s shock value — Barby Garcia Gutiérrez, 47, a marketing business owner from Salt Lake City, arrived at a house in Canada to date a group of men who were not far in age from her son. The show showed Ms. Gutiérrez playing footsie in a hot tub and playing bawdy games.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elijah Bodell and his mother, Barby Garcia Gutiérrez, who appeared on the second season of “MILF Manor.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Barby Garcia Gutiérrez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Before her son, Elijah Bodell, 27, watched the show, he asked friends of his to screen it for him first to see if he could handle it. When he watched the first few episodes, he said, he found himself feeling automatically skeptical about the intentions of the young men who chose to be on the show.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I know how dudes my age think about a lot of stuff,” he said. “They know they’ve got cameras on them. You never get someone’s authentic self.”</p><p>Ms. Gutiérrez said that her appearance on the show tested her relationship with her son, who has reservations with reality TV in general, but that the show also gave him a fuller picture of who she is.</p><p>“I tell him all the time that just because I’m you’re mom doesn’t mean I’m not human — I have needs and wants and desires,” she said.</p><p>For Mr. Turner’s daughters, there was an outsize adjustment period. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/27/style/gerry-turner-golden-bachelor.html" title="">after their father was announced as the first Golden Bachelor</a>, he was suddenly the subject of billboards, thirsty social media posts and the cover of TV Guide, which called him “TV’s sexiest senior.”</p><p>“Having all these people like, ‘Oh my god, he’s so hot, his hair is so great,’ I’m like, Cringe,” Angie Warner, 42, said. “That’s my dad<em>.</em>”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Turner’s daughters, Angie Warner, left, and Jenny Young. “As a daughter, you innately have that protective nature,” Ms. Warner said of her response to negative press about her father.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Angie Warner</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>She said she had not been adequately prepared for the negative side of her father’s fame. Many online commenters turned on Mr. Turner after the publication of <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/golden-bachelor-gerry-turner-ex-girlfriend-speaks-out-1235683869/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Hollywood Reporter article that scrutinized his romantic history</a>. The pile-on resumed when Mr. Turner announced his divorce from Theresa Nist, the woman he married on the show.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“As a daughter, you innately have that protective nature,” Ms. Warner said. “Not all stories are true, not everything that everybody says is true. But you can’t really defend that, so you kind of have to take it and move on.”</p><p>Some children of this new kind of reality-show star have helped to turn their parents’ TV fame into an enterprise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brittany Noles Law, left, with her client and mother, Susan Noles.
