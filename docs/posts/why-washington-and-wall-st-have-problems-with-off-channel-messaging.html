But it’s also reminiscent of how Wall Street firms got into hot water for similar reasons. They had to pay more than $2 billion for doing the kind of off-channel messaging that Hegseth and others are being sharply criticized for now.</p><p><strong>“We are currently clean on OPSEC,”</strong> Hegseth wrote at one point, referring to operational security, during a group chat on Signal, according to Goldberg. The defense secretary then revealed detailed war plans on the same channel. Goldberg, who had been added by Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, said he didn’t include the most sensitive details from the chat in his article.</p><p>While Goldberg writes that he was initially unsure whether the whole thing was a joke or a misinformation campaign, the launching of airstrikes on targets in Yemen eventually persuaded him that it was real. (Waltz had responded with emojis to the bombing details: “👊🇺🇸🔥”.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Goldberg later left the group and confirmed with the White House that the chat was real.</p><p><strong>Critics say the group chat violated laws and security protocols.</strong> It did not take place on government-vetted secure systems and it may have occurred on government officials’ phones, which have been targets of hacking by foreign adversaries.</p><p>Moreover, Waltz had set some of the group’s messages to disappear after one week and some after four weeks. Because they involved discussions about official acts, if they weren’t promptly forwarded to official government accounts for archiving, the participants could have run afoul of federal laws.</p><p><strong>Such accusations are similar to those that financial firms faced from regulators,</strong> which have imposed big fines for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/business/banks-fines-whatsapp-records.html" title="">use of “off-channel” messaging services</a> including Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage. More than two dozen institutions — including the trading app Robinhood, the lenders Wells Fargo and BNP Paribas, and others — admitted to violating record-keeping provisions of federal securities laws. (Individual bankers were also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-01-26-2023/card/morgan-stanley-fines-bankers-up-to-1-million-for-chat-app-use-1fCfNgdYWEeEKC6GlUHc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fined by their employers</a>.)</p><p>The reasons are similar: The S.E.C. and others have pushed banks to keep tabs on their employees’ messages to ensure that no laws are being broken. “Record-keeping failures such as those here undermine our ability to exercise effective regulatory oversight, often at the expense of investors,” Sanjay Wadhwa, then the S.E.C.’s deputy director of enforcement, said in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-149" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2023, announcing $289 million in fines</a> against 11 firms.</p><p><strong>Will Trump-era regulators police this going forward? </strong>Two of the S.E.C.’s current commissioners, Mark Uyeda (who’s now acting chair) and Hester Peirce, have criticized such cases because “it does not appear that firms have <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-peirce-uyeda-qatalyst-09242024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an achievable path to compliance</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Paul Atkins, President Trump’s pick to lead the commission, feels similarly: “I’m not sure that’s the most productive or the best paradigm for an agency to follow,” <a href="https://fedsoc.org/conferences/twelfth-annual-executive-branch-review-conference-ebrxii#agenda-item-luncheon-panel-u-s-financial-regulation-principles-opportunities-and-challenges" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said at a Federalist Society panel</a> last April.</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>The F.B.I. creates a task force to investigate Tesla attacks.</strong> “<a href="https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1904253808374649020" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This is domestic terrorism</a>,” Kash Patel, the agency’s director, wrote on X in announcing the news, promising to bring those responsible for cases of vandalism or arson “to justice.” But an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/tesla-protests-vandalism-musk.html" title="">internal intelligence assessment</a> by the Trump administration found that attacks on Tesla properties and vehicles probably weren’t coordinated and warned against conflating legal protests against Mr. Musk with vandalism to Teslas, The Times reports.</p><p><strong>Boeing is reportedly seeking to withdraw its federal plea agreement.</strong> The embattled plane maker is hoping it can <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-is-pushing-to-withdraw-guilty-plea-agreement-7cc9c06b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">get more favorable treatment</a> from the Justice Department under President Trump, after it pleaded guilty to deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration before two deadly crashes of 737 Max 9 jets, The Wall Street Journal reports. If the department follows suit, it would mark one of the most notable examples of a softer stance on some white-collar crime enforcement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Samsung Electronics’ co-C.E.O. dies. </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/han-jong-hee-dead.html" title="">Han Jong-Hee</a>, who oversaw the Korean conglomerate’s smartphone and consumer businesses and was a nearly four-decade veteran of the company, died earlier on Tuesday of a heart attack, a company spokeswoman said. He was 63. His death adds to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/samsung-electronics-co-ceo-han-jong-hee-has-died-74631d56" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">challenges facing Samsung</a>: Its stock has fallen more than 23 percent over the past 12 months amid questions about its A.I. chip-making and its smartphone sales.</p><h2 id="link-7f5a64f9">What markets are telling us about tariffs </h2><p>For weeks, the markets have been sending the message that American multinationals will be among the most at risk from President Trump’s trade war.</p><p>That seemed apparent when the S&amp;P 500 briefly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/sp-500-stocks-market-correction.html" title="">tumbled into correction territory</a> earlier this month. And it was clear again on Monday when stocks rallied as the White House signaled it could go easy on trading partners when it announces its next round of duties on April 2.</p><p><strong>Here’s the latest:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Trump said on Monday that he “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/us/trump-news/2e9acc03-e877-55fd-81ad-50cd1f1b625f?smid=url-share" title="">may give a lot of countries breaks</a>,” a sign that the White House is beginning to factor in potential disruptions to global trade from its tariff policy.</p></li><li><p>Stocks gained on Monday, with the Magnificent 7 group of tech giants posting their best one-day gain in more than two months as investors cheered the conciliatory signals.</p></li></ul><p>That said, it’s unclear if the Trump administration is putting much stock in the market’s ups and downs as it plots its next move. S&amp;P 500 futures on Tuesday point to modest gains.</p><p><strong>Trump has changed tack on trade policy before</strong>. Last month, the administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/business/tariffs-de-minimis-trump-china.html" title="">scrapped the so-called de minimis exception</a>, a duty-free provision applied to goods worth up to $800. Days later it was reinstated following upheaval at customs checkpoints, and after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/business/dealbook/defying-musk-trump-doge.html" title="">logistics companies lobbied for relief</a>. That experience offers a warning of potential chaos, and hopes that the administration may dial back tariff policy if it becomes too disruptive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“If the elimination of de-minimis trade sowed chaos, how much more could the business cycle be disrupted if the reciprocal tariffs are rushed out before considering the downstream implications for U.S. businesses?” Tim Quinlan, a Wells Fargo economist, wrote in a research note on Monday.</p><p><strong>It wasn’t all good news on tariffs on Monday.</strong> Trump reiterated that duties on auto and pharmaceutical imports <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/trump-tariffs-autos-pharmaceuticals-sectoral-reciprocal.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were in the works</a>. And he threatened 25 percent tariffs on any country that bought <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-plans-tariffs-on-countries-buying-energy-from-venezuela-0d89ff1c?mod=hp_lead_pos1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">energy from Venezuela</a> as he increased pressure on the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro. Those tensions put Chevron, which has a big presence in the South American country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/us/trump-news?smid=url-share#e10b9188-6012-5782-8c98-284ab8ecc6d2" title="">under the gun</a>.</p><p>And bonds sold off, with the yield on a 10-year Treasury note, which underpins mortgage and credit card lending rates, rising to a one-month high. Inflation and growth concerns are weighing on bond holders.</p><p>Raphael Bostic, the Atlanta Fed president, now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/fed-s-bostic-now-sees-just-one-rate-cut-this-year-due-to-tariffs?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sees the central bank cutting borrowing costs</a> just once this year with inflation hovering well above the Fed’s 2 percent target. He added that the lack of clarity on White House policy was muddling internal Fed forecasts.</p><p>Businesses have told the White House something similar, The Times’s Ana Swanson reports.</p><p>Their message to Trump officials: Remove trade-war measures; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/economy/trump-tariffs-us-exporters.html" title="">don’t increase them</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-55cfee2e">More bad news for deal makers</h2><p>Coming into this year, deal makers were anticipating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/business/dealbook/year-in-deal-making.html" title="">a big rebound</a> in M.&amp;A. and I.P.O.s.</p><p>With CoreWeave expected to price this week, there’s still high hope for the latter.
