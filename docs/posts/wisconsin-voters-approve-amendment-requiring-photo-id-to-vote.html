    <h1>Wisconsin Voters Approve Amendment Requiring Photo ID to Vote</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Democratic leaders opposed the effort for the amendment in Wisconsin, arguing that it would disenfranchise voters including students, older people and particularly Black voters, who <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/impact-voter-suppression-communities-color" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies</a> have shown are less likely to carry photo identification than white voters. While Black voters make up only about 5 percent of Wisconsin’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/15/us/elections/milwaukee-black-voters.html" title="">electorate</a>, they overwhelmingly favor Democratic candidates.</p><p>Democrats also questioned why the amendment should be a priority at all, saying that Republicans were neglecting more pressing matters facing the state such as affordable child care, public education and gun control.</p><p>Last week, President Trump stepped into the fray on voter ID requirements, issuing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/trump-elections-voting-executive-order.html" title="">an executive order</a> seeking to require documentary proof of citizenship to vote. Democrats responded with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/trump-executive-order-elections-lawsuit.html" title="">a lawsuit</a> on Monday, arguing that the president’s order was unconstitutional and that he has no explicit authority to regulate elections.</p><p>Thirty-six states ask for or require voters to show some form of identification at the polls, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group.</p><p>Polls show that voter ID laws enjoy broad bipartisan support, with a Pew Research survey conducted in January <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/07/bipartisan-support-for-early-in-person-voting-voter-id-election-day-national-holiday/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finding</a> that 81 percent of voters agree with a requirement that all voters should show government-issued identification to cast ballots.</p></div></div>
