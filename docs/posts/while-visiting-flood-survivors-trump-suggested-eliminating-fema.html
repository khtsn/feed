He first stopped in the parts of North Carolina ravaged by Hurricane Helene, and then headed for Los Angeles, where catastrophic wildfires continue to burn.</p><p>In North Carolina, Trump met with families struggling with an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/trump-north-carolina-floods-asheville.html" title="">extremely slow and costly recovery</a> from last year’s flooding. There, the president said he was considering shutting down the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “FEMA’s not good,” Trump said.</p><p>He also said that states should respond first to disasters, which is already how the system works. FEMA steps in only if a state can’t handle a disaster on its own, or at the request of a governor. Officials in both parties have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/los-angeles-wildfires-california/trump-fema-states-disasters" title="">suggested improving the agency</a>, but few have called to shutter it. It has long been supported by members of Congress, who control its funding.</p><p>In Los Angeles, where Trump was set to land around the time this newsletter arrived in your inbox, the president was planning to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/trump-la-visit-wildfires.html" title="">visit neighborhoods destroyed</a> by one of the most damaging fires in California’s history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold aid from the state unless it changed environmental policies that he claimed had prevented enough water from going to Southern California. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/trump-newsom-water-fires.html" title="">experts have said</a> that the problems with fighting the fires had nothing to do with water transfers from the north.</p><p><strong>The latest in California: </strong>Much-needed rain is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/los-angeles-wildfires-california" title="">help firefighting efforts this weekend</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractor building in Chicago on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Hooley/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7b6c23ec">Trump moved to quickly expel migrants Biden allowed in</h2><p>The Trump administration gave Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials the power to quickly deport migrants who were allowed into the country temporarily under Biden-era programs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-immigrants-deportation.html" title="">according to a memo obtained by The Times</a>.</p><p>The Biden-era programs were a self-service scheduling app that Trump shut down on Monday, and an initiative that let in some migrants fleeing Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti.

It’s a pillar of Roman cuisine, in which just three ingredients — pasta, pecorino cheese and black pepper — produce a bold and memorable flavor. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/science/cacio-e-pepe-recipe-corn-starch.html" title="">a group of Italian physicists decided it could be improved</a>.</p><p>The scientists claim that to be truly “optimized,” cacio e pepe needed a fourth ingredient: cornstarch. By adding a teaspoon or so, they said, even a novice could mix the pasta together without turning it into a gooey mess. It remains unclear if any Italian nonnas will be convinced.</p><p>Have a well-balanced weekend.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
