    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Nolichucky Dam in eastern Tennessee was on the brink of failure early Saturday and the authorities urged the residents of communities downstream to evacuate immediately, after extreme rainfall from Helene caused water levels in the area to rise to record levels.</p><p>The National Weather Service office in Morristown, Tenn., said dam failure was imminent and flash flooding was likely to occur downstream. “If you are in low lying areas below the Nolichucky Dam you should move to higher ground immediately,” its alert said.</p><p>“A breach could occur at any time,” said Elisabeth Thompson, a spokeswoman for the <a href="https://x.com/TVAnews/status/1839881049888763904" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tennessee Valley Authority</a>, the dam’s operator, adding that potentially life-threatening flooding could occur as far downstream as Douglas Lake.</p><p>A dispatch officer at the Greene County Sheriff’s Department said that there were a couple cracks in the dam and evacuations were ongoing early Saturday.</p></div></div>
