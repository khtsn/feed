But the uncertainty over the country’s political future has only deepened since.</p><p>On Friday, the country’s opposition parties, which dominate the National Assembly, impeached Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who had been serving as acting president since Mr. Yoon’s impeachment two weeks ago. Choi Sang-mok, the finance minister, was named the new acting president.</p><p>The parliamentary vote on Friday was the first time in South Korean history that an acting president had been impeached, adding to the political turmoil created by Mr. Yoon’s ill-fated martial law and his impeachment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In addition to his impeachment, Mr. Yoon faces a criminal inquiry, the first ever to target a sitting South Korean president.</p><p>Here is how the crisis has unfolded.</p><h2 id="link-5cc0e3f0">Why was the President Yoon impeached?</h2><p>Mr. Yoon’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law.html" title="">martial law decree</a> on Dec. 3, which put the country under military rule for the first time in 45 years, lasted only six hours.

He will lead South Korea with no real political heft as the country faces challenges like North Korea’s growing nuclear threat and the return of Donald J.
