It is also spreading the fruits of transgression across the globe. With more than half of the country battle-struck following the military coup in February 2021 that unseated the civilian authority of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/world/asia/suu-kyi-moved-junta-myanmar.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">Daw Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, Myanmar is racking up dubious superlatives.</p><p>It is now the world’s largest producer of opium and one of the world’s largest manufacturers of synthetic drugs, including methamphetamine, ketamine and fentanyl. Concocted with precursor chemicals from neighboring China and India, tablets made in Myanmar feed habits as far away as Australia. With factories in overdrive and international law enforcement overwhelmed, street prices of these drugs are alarmingly cheap.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Buildings dot green fields under a cloudy sky." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk/00myanmar-crime-state-02-pmtk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9886481a-a45d-5ba5-acb3-bcacfc122321" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>For years, farmers grew their poppies in mountains and valleys away from certain authorities.

It is also thought to be the world’s largest exporter of certain heavy rare earth elements that power clean energy worldwide. In battlefields turned toxic wastelands, workers dig in illegal mines, then dispatch the rare earths to China along old smuggling routes. The Southeast Asian nation is also home to the best jade and ruby on the planet, much of it extracted by young men addicted to the same drugs that are flooding the global market. Poachers scour Myanmar’s forests for endangered wildlife and timber, too, often bound for China.</p><p>The war in Myanmar is expanding the reach of Chinese criminal syndicates, which are operating with impunity and monopolistic ambition in the region, despite occasional crackdowns by Beijing. Chinese weapons flow both to the ruling junta and to the resistance forces that are fighting it.</p><p>In Myanmar’s borderlands, criminal networks that unite Chinese kingpins with ethnic warlords are kidnapping people from all over the globe to toil in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/17/world/asia/myanmar-cyber-scam.html" title="">factories that scam people online</a>. International police organizations say that this online fraud has bilked billions of dollars from retirees and lonely hearts in the United States, China, Europe and beyond.</p><p>“Organized crime has a vested interest in conflict continuing because it thrives in that environment,” said Masood Karimipour, the regional representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific for the United Nations <a href="https://www.unodc.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Office on Drugs and Crime</a>, or U.N.O.D.C. “And the longer the conflict goes on, the more territory falls under the control or influence of parties who stand to profit.”</p><p>“The profits,” he added, “are from truly horrifying things that are destroying lives in Myanmar and in many other countries.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Myanmar military and the ethnic militias that have aligned with it are by far the biggest drivers of the illicit economy. Since the coup, international sanctions imposed because of the army’s terrible human rights record have cut into the junta’s profits. But those fighting on the side of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/world/asia/myanmar-poet-ko-maung-saungkha.html" title="">democracy</a> and regional autonomy also know that illegal proceeds are the easiest way to fuel their war machine.</p><p>New York Times reporting within Myanmar over the past few years of intensifying war has laid bare how the country’s descent into failed statehood is stoking conflict at home and exporting misery, dependency and corruption across continents.</p><p>These are the biggest cogs in Myanmar’s military-industrial crime complex:</p><h2 id="link-4ca461bb">Opium in the Open</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the Shan Hills of Myanmar, the opium poppy is called “the peace flower.”</p><p>The name is an irony: There has not been true peace in Shan State for decades. Over the years, more than a dozen ethnic guerrilla groups have fought the Myanmar military — and each other — for dominance, not only of the territory but of the drug trade, too.</p><p>This planting season, opium farming in Pekon Township in Shan State reached a troubling milestone. For years, farmers grew their poppies in mountains and valleys, away from the authorities that would, sometimes at gunpoint, impose taxes, demand a cut of the crop or even destroy their fields.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Today, these growers cultivate opium flowers openly in their villages.

But impoverished farmers in these isolated hills say there was little market for such crops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Besides, opium, which has been used sparingly as medicine for generations here, is more lucrative. This flowering season, which runs from November to February, prices for opium resin are already reaching $430 per pound, three times what they were a few years ago.</p><p>“Life is unpredictable,” said Ko Htein Lin, who has given over his farmland for opium poppies. “We need to make money when we can.”</p><p>The U.N.O.D.C. estimates that up to $1.26 billion in heroin, mostly derived from Shan State opium, was exported from Myanmar this year. Many of the opium farmers in Pekon are sharecroppers who were displaced by the fighting and earn as little as $2 a day.</p><p>“I have to survive,” said Ko Pa Lae, who with his family fled junta airstrikes on their hometown.</p><p>A year ago, a resistance offensive pushed the military out of dozens of towns, bringing these opium fields under the mandate of an ethnic armed group that is part of the antigovernment resistance force. At the same time, the Myanmar military — which terrorizes the civilian population with airstrikes and drone attacks — and its associated militias are buying most of the opium grown here, locals say. Some rebels fighting the military are also complicit in the trade, though other armed groups have eschewed drug trafficking completely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Raw opium. “Life is unpredictable,” said one farmer who now grows poppies. “We need to make money when we can.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Ferguson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A camp for internally displaced people in Shan State that was damaged by a military airstrike.

Warlords in certain self-administered regions of Shan State have long overseen drug economies, with the military and its proxies taking a cut of the profits. Air force helicopters would fly packets of pills and chunks of crystal methamphetamine to cities and ports for distribution overseas, former pilots said.</p><p>Production in Myanmar intensified after a crackdown on the assembly of drugs in China. The chemical precursors instead found their way to Myanmar, and Chinese lab technicians taught locals how to craft crystal methamphetamine, also known as ice, in jungle redoubts. Chinese kingpins brought in pill presses to make yaba.</p><p>In 2019, in the northern Shan State village of Konemon under the control of an ethnic armed group, a visit by The Times showed the extent to which methamphetamine production dominated the local economy. All but three homes, locals said, were involved in making yaba. At night, the thrum of generators broke the quiet of the Shan Hills. A sour smell pervaded from the acid used in drug making.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The intensity of workshops churning out synthetic drugs has reached a new high since the army takeover in Myanmar, drug trade monitors and law enforcers say. Ethnic armed groups in Shan State have begun producing new club drugs, such as “happy water” and lollipops made with a cocktail that includes ketamine, MDMA and methamphetamine.</p><p>Synthetic drugs are pouring out of Shan State to Laos and Thailand, reconstituting the infamous Golden Triangle. They are smuggled to Bangladesh and India by ethnic rebels who are both fighting the junta and in business with it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The yaba pills can sometimes be delivered in watermelon boxes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mules inside an abandoned building in northern Shan State.

Sometimes they break up pro-democracy dissent or threaten entrepreneurs thought to support the resistance movement. Mostly, though, they organize the movement of synthetic drugs from rebel-held areas to junta-controlled territory before they head abroad by sea and land.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>“We are called a people’s militia, but we rarely engage in fighting,” said Ko Ye, one of its members. “We engage in the drug trade.”</p><h2 id="link-49228b3e">Scam Mills With Global Reach</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>On Myanmar’s border with Thailand, in what was once dense jungle, Ko Kyaw Htay worked on the third floor of a windowless boiler room, huddled over his phone, he recalled. In 12-hour shifts, he and about 40 others sat at plastic tables, all absorbed in online conversations, he said, with people across the world: China, Mexico, Japan, Italy, India and the United States.</p><p>Mr. Kyaw Htay’s marks were in France, and he used Google Translate to build relationships. “You’re so beautiful,” he wrote to widows, liberally adding heart emojis. Or he made his profile photo that of a longhaired Asian woman and, in deliberately broken French, wooed older men eager for love.</p><p>The online romances soon gave way to talk of investments.

She said “yes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>In a good month, Mr. Kyaw Htay said, he scammed as much as 80,000 euros ($83,000) out of victims. He was paid about $445 a month for his work, he said, a good salary in post-coup Myanmar. Unlike the foreigners in the room with him — four Africans, seven Indians and five Chinese — he had come willingly to this border enclave run by a Chinese crime syndicate.</p><p>The United Nations estimated last year that at least 120,000 foreigners were being forced into the cybercrime and online gambling industries in Myanmar. Many had been duped by ads promising clerical, technical or customer service jobs in Southeast Asia. An Interpol operation last year found people from 22 countries who had been compelled to work in cybercrime hubs in Myanmar.

The old woman to whom he had sold the idea of crypto-backed real estate wrote of her grief over her husband’s death. Shyly, she professed her love for the stranger who had first contacted her by WhatsApp. She had handed over her savings for the scheme, around 15,000 euros.

Residents noted that within a few months, nearly all of Pangwa’s pine forests were uprooted, except for a clump of trees in a cemetery where the local militia boss’s grandparents were buried.</p><p>Pangwa, like two other mining towns, has been destroyed, residents said. U San Hlaing worked the mines, his bare hands blistered and burned from the corrosive acid used in the extraction process. The air was full of dust, and he developed a constant, hacking cough. To make it through the long days spent digging pits and lugging chemicals, Mr. San Hlaing resorted to yaba, as did most miners.</p><p>“It’s a bad cycle because most of the money we earn goes to buying more drugs,” he said. “Work destroys our health, and drugs destroy our lives.”</p><p>Toxic chemicals have infiltrated the soil, environmentalists said.
