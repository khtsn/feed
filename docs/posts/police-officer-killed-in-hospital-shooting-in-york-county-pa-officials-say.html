The other two officers were in stable condition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Three hospital staff members — a doctor, a nurse and custodian — were wounded and were in stable condition, officials said. Another staff member was hurt in a fall. No patients were injured.</p><p>Tim Barker, the York County district attorney, said at an afternoon news conference that Mr. Archangel-Ortiz targeted the intensive care unit of the hospital, which is in West Manchester Township, Pa. His motive was unknown.</p><p>Mr. Barker added that the gunman had recently contacted the hospital unit regarding a “medical purpose of another individual,” but declined to provide further details. He also declined to provide additional background information about Mr. Archangel-Ortiz.</p><p>Around 10:35 a.m., the gunman entered the hospital with a handgun and zip ties, and soon took several staff members as hostages. The gunman opened fire at about 11 a.m., Susan Manko, a vice president of public relations for the hospital, said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Archangel-Ortiz held a staff member at gunpoint as police officers readied to breach the I.C.U. He restrained one staff member’s hands with a zip tie. The officers tried to talk with the gunman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When he came out into the hallway threatening the hostage, police officers opened fire, killing him, Mr. Barker said. That’s when the gunman opened fire, striking the officers.</p><p>Officer Duarte was a member of the West York Police Department for nearly three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he served as an officer in the Denver Police Department in Colorado for more than five years. He graduated from Pennsylvania Western University, California, in California, Pa., in 2016.</p><p>Those who were wounded were evaluated in the emergency department at WellSpan York Hospital in York, Pa., less than five miles from UPMC Memorial, according to a spokeswoman for WellSpan.</p><p>At the afternoon news conference, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania said that he had been in contact with the White House about the shooting and thanked the Trump administration for its concern. He said that the state did not need help from the federal government.</p><p>“Here in York County today, we saw the very best and the very worst of humanity,” Mr. Shapiro said, thanking law enforcement officers and hospital staff members for their bravery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Michael Muldrow, the commissioner of the York City Police Department, said in a statement that he believed the shooting exemplified how officers respond to threats to public safety.</p><p>“Today is a sobering and humbling reminder of how much potential danger truly exists in the world (at any given time) and just how quickly situations can go bad,” Mr. Muldrow said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lauren McCarthy, a planning editor for live coverage at The Times, is on temporary assignment as a breaking-news reporter.<a href="https://twitter.com/laurenamccarth"><br/></a><span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lauren-mccarthy">More about Lauren McCarthy</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
