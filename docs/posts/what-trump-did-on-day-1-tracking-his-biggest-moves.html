    <h1>What Trump Did on Day 1: Tracking His Biggest Moves</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="link-2a1035c4"><span>He began a crackdown on immigration.</span></h3><p>A series of orders Mr. Trump signed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-starts-immigration-crackdown-enlisting-the-military-and-testing-the-law.html" title="">set off a policy barrage</a> aimed at sealing the nation’s borders to migrants and cracking down on immigrants already in the country. Those orders included a declaration of a national emergency to deploy the military to the border and a bid to cut off birthright citizenship for the children of noncitizens. Many of the orders test the legal limits of his authority, and birthright citizenship in particular is protected by the Constitution.</p><h3 id="link-17e88e01"><span>He sought to put off a ban on TikTok.</span></h3><p>Mr. Trump signed an executive order <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/technology/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-executive-order.html?smid=url-share" title="">aimed at delaying a federal ban of TikTok</a>. It is unclear if that order could override the law that banned the social media app, but the measure instructs the attorney general not to take any action to enforce the ban for 75 days. Mr. Trump also told reporters that “the U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok” if a deal for the app is reached.</p><h3 id="link-36d536ac"><span>He withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.</span></h3><p>Mr. Trump signed an executive order to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" title="">withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement</a>, which would make America one of only four nations — along with Iran, Libya and Yemen — not party to the agreement, under which nations work together to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><h3 id="link-5f18439"><span>He enacted a federal hiring freeze.</span></h3><p>Mr. Trump ordered a hiring freeze across the federal government that would remain in place pending the completion of a broader plan for reducing the federal work force. The order <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/us/trump-executive-orders/trump-singles-out-the-irs-work-force-in-his-hiring-freeze-executive-order?smid=url-share" title="">singled out the Internal Revenue Service</a>, which received a large financial boost from President Biden and Democrats in Congress, calling for the freeze to stay in place longer for that agency.</p><h3 id="link-2c926459"><span>He gutted racial equity policies and protections for transgender people.</span></h3><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-transgender-race-education.html?smid=url-share" title="">ordered his administration to dismantle federal programs</a> that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and to gut Biden administration policies that protect transgender Americans.</p></div></div>
