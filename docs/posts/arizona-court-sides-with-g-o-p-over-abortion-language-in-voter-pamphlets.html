Reversing a lower court decision that the term violated state law requiring “impartial” language in the publicity pamphlets, the high court said <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/az-abortion-access-v-toma-supreme-court-decision.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a brief order</a> that the language “substantially complies” with the requirement for impartiality.</p><p>The words “unborn human being” will not appear on actual ballots; the language on the ballots is determined by the secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, who is a Democrat. </p><p>Abortion rights groups — who celebrated when Mr. Fontes announced late Monday that they had gathered a record number of signatures to put the question on the November ballot — said they were “deeply disappointed” by the court’s ruling.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“This decision is beyond disgraceful,” Athena Salman, the director of Arizona campaigns for Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. “Muddying the waters and relying on lies are the only tools left for anti-abortion extremists, whose agenda is demonstrably at odds with voters in our state.” </p><p>“Unborn human being” and “unborn child” are the terms long used by anti-abortion groups, who seek to establish that life begins at conception, and to ban abortion from that point. </p><p>Polls show that most Arizona voters support the abortion rights measure, Proposition 139, and Democrats are hoping that it will drive higher turnout to their advantage in a battleground state: Arizona will be crucial not only in the presidential race but also in the party’s fight to keep its narrow majority in the Senate.</p><p>Voters have sided with abortion rights groups in all seven states where ballot questions on abortion have appeared in the two years since the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that found a right to abortion in the Constitution. That includes purple and red states such as Kansas and Ohio.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Plastic models of fetuses at the Statehouse in Phoenix, in April. “Unborn human being” and “unborn child” are the terms anti-abortion groups often use in their campaigns.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cassidy Araiza for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>As that winning streak has widened, Republicans and anti-abortion groups have sought to make it harder to get measures on the ballot, or to pass them. In Montana, one of three states where abortion rights groups are waiting for official certification of the signatures they gathered for a ballot amendment, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/montana-ballot-petition-signature-rules-bd415bd67353ad080efa7bb3ab7f5a92" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Supreme Court ruled last month that the Republican secretary of state wrongly tried to change election rules</a> to disqualify signatures from inactive voters.</p></div><div><div><p>With measures <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/dashboard/ballot-tracker-status-of-abortion-related-state-constitutional-amendment-measures/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now officially on the ballot in November in eight states</a>, abortion opponents are trying to shape the official state language that voters will see as they prepare to cast their ballots.</p><p>Last month in Florida, for example, a state panel largely appointed by Republicans <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4778429-florida-abortion-amendment-backers-decry-financial-impact-statement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved language</a> for a financial impact statement required to accompany a proposed abortion rights amendment. The statement says that the amendment would result in “significantly” more abortions and fewer live births, and could force the state to pay high legal costs to resolve lawsuits that might result from it, and that an increase in abortions “may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time.”</p><p>Arizona’s governor, Katie Hobbs, is a Democrat, but the justices on the high court were all appointed by Republicans. In April, the court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/us/arizona-abortion-ban.html" title="">ruled that a ban on abortion passed in 1864</a>, before Arizona was a state, was still in effect and should be enforced. The Legislature then voted to repeal the ban, leaving in place a prohibition on abortion after 15 weeks.</p><p>Joanna De La Cruz, a spokeswoman for It Goes Too Far, a group opposing the measure, defended the language in the publicity pamphlet as “impartial and accurate” and argued that the language on the ballot itself is misleading. </p></div></div><div><div><p>“It would serve voters well to have had the actual language of the amendment be more clear so they knew they were choosing between the current 15-week limit and unlimited, unregulated abortion under Prop 139,” she said in a statement.</p><p>The amendment, similar to those passed by voters in Ohio and Michigan and on the ballot in Missouri and Florida, asks voters to establish a “fundamental” right to abortion, prohibiting the state from restricting or banning abortion before viability — the point where a fetus can survive outside the uterus, generally around 24 weeks of pregnancy — except to protect the pregnant woman’s health.</p><p>After viability the state could restrict abortion, unless in the “good faith judgment of a treating health care professional,” it was necessary to protect the health or life of the pregnant patient.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Arizona State Courts building in Phoenix, which houses the Arizona Supreme Court. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caitlin O&#39;Hara for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
