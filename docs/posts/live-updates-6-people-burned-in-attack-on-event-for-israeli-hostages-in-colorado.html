They <a href="#a-sunday-ritual-turns-into-a-scene-that-looked-like-a-war-zone" title="">often wear red, speak the names of the hostages, and sometimes sing</a>. And they agree to return the next Sunday, same time, same place.</p><div><p>That ritual was shattered when the man, later identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, yelled “Free Palestine” and threw an incendiary device into the crowd, according to Mark Michalek, the F.B.I. special agent in charge. Within moments, smoke and screams filled the air. Victims fell to the ground. Others tried to put out flames with discarded clothes. </p><p>The incident <a href="#jewish-community-attacks-boulder-colorado" title="">intensified fears</a> as the latest attack on the Jewish community in the United States, coming after two Israeli embassy employees were shot and killed last month outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania was burned by an arsonist.</p><p>Here’s what to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The victims:</strong> The victims’ ages spanned from 67 to 88, the authorities said, and their injuries ranged in severity. Two were airlifted to a burn unit at a hospital in the Denver area, officials said.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Calls for help:</strong> Calls about an emergency on the Pearl Street pedestrian mall near Boulder’s county courthouse came in starting at 1:26 p.m. local time, Boulder’s police chief, Steve Redfearn, said at a news conference. Initial reports mentioned a man with a weapon and said people were being set on fire. Chief Redfearn said investigators were not entirely certain what happened, but the report was “fairly consistent with the injuries that we found on scene.”</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Suspect arrested:</strong> The suspect, Mr. Soliman, was taken into custody after witnesses pointed him out, the chief said. Videos on social media showed a man, shirtless and holding two bottles, shouting while bystanders helped injured people nearby. Patches of grass in front of the courthouse were on fire. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>A peaceful gathering:</strong> The victims were participating in <a href="https://run4lives.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Run for Their Lives</a>, a weekly event that has brought attention to the Israeli hostages being held in Gaza since the Thanksgiving after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel. “Our walk has been nothing ever but peaceful, and this was a blatant act of antisemitism on the streets of Boulder,” said Rachel Amaru, a leader of the group.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>“Appears to be a hate crime”:</strong> The attorney general of Colorado, Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said in a statement that “this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” He added, “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences.”</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDU5Njg1OGMtODEyMS01MDgwLWI0MWQtNjUxODNiZGZlZjQx"><div id="d596858c-8121-5080-b41d-65183bdfef41" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/01/us/boulder-colorado-attack#d596858c-8121-5080-b41d-65183bdfef41"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dave-philipps"><img alt="Dave Philipps" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/reader-center/author-dave-philipps/author-dave-philipps-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/reader-center/author-dave-philipps/author-dave-philipps-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/reader-center/author-dave-philipps/author-dave-philipps-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-02T03:22:51.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 1, 2025, 11:22 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Late Sunday, police and the <a href="http://f.bi/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.B.I</a>. had a residential block in Colorado Springs cordoned off with patrol cars.

They have done so since a few weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. They begin at Pearl and Seventh Streets and walk toward the courthouse, along a pedestrian mall.</p><p>Lisa Effress, 55, who has lived in Boulder for 17 years, has been there since the first walk. “Whenever I’m in town,” she said, “I try to be there.”</p><div><p>The ritual is simple: walk, speak the names of those still held hostage, sometimes sing “Hatikvah,” the Israel national anthem, and bear witness. The numbers vary — 20, sometimes 100. People see the group, hear the songs, and fall into step.</p><p>They wear red. It’s symbolic. It’s visible.</p><p>Ms. Effress wasn’t walking this Sunday. She was across the street, having lunch with her daughter. But lunch got cut short. She heard sirens. Police cars, ambulances.</p><p>She checked the time and figured the group must be near the courthouse. She left lunch and ran over.</p><p>“I knew immediately — I just knew,” she said. “I ran across the street, looking for everyone.”</p><p>What she found felt surreal. Smoke. Discarded clothes used to extinguish flames. People dazed, half-undressed. Bags and backpacks left behind in panic. And then, she saw a friend who was a Holocaust survivor, being helped into an ambulance.</p><p>“It was horrible,” said Ms. Effress, a filmmaker and managing partner in a post-production company. </p><p>On every walk, Ms. Effress said, she is vigilant. Alert to strange behavior, to tension in the air. “We are peaceful. We are not protesters,” she said. “But there are always people protesting us.”</p><p>She added: “I have always taught my daughter: Be proud to be Jewish. Don’t be afraid. But in a time like this, it is crazy to think we will ever be walking again. It’s dangerous, it’s not safe for us.”</p><p>She said that according to a Whatsapp chat for the walking group, the weekly walk has been canceled indefinitely.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTNlMGMwOTEtNTVmOC01NzU3LTlmYmQtYzdhMjZlNDRmMzgw"><div id="a3e0c091-55f8-5757-9fbd-c7a26e44f380" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/01/us/boulder-colorado-attack#a3e0c091-55f8-5757-9fbd-c7a26e44f380"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alexandra-e-petri"><img alt="Alexandra E.
