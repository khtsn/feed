    <h1>Democrats Unveil Convention Platform With Familiar Themes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the top of the list of issues that could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/dnc-democrats-israel-gaza.html" title="">threaten the party’s cohesiveness</a> is the war in Gaza. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are descending on Chicago, and roughly 30 delegates representing the Democratic primary voters who opposed Mr. Biden, mostly in protest over Gaza, will attend the convention, which begins on Monday.</p><p>The platform repeats a traditional Democratic message supporting Israel, condemning the brutal Oct. 7 assault by Hamas and backing “an immediate and lasting cease-fire deal” that will return hostages still being held by the terrorist group and address “the displacement and death of so many innocent people in Gaza.”</p><p>Democrats will vote to approve the platform on Monday evening. It was passed by the party’s platform committee, a group of party insiders, with wider input from “community leaders from coalitions across the Democratic Party,” according to the Democratic National Committee.</p><p>On other issues, the platform represents a predictable collection of Democratic policy priorities, including calls to make investments in infrastructure and manufacturing; to cut taxes on working families while making big corporations and the wealthy “finally pay their fair share”; and to fight climate change.</p><p>Another section addresses efforts to lower costs on everyday items like food, housing and health care, in similar terms to the economic agenda that Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/kamala-harris-raleigh-nc-economy.html" title="">rolled out last week</a>. And there are also calls to protect abortion rights, restore democratic norms and combat gun violence.</p></div></div>
