Mike DeWine announced on Monday that he was sending the state police to the city to reassure the community that the schools were safe and to avoid the evacuations of threatened schools that have disrupted learning over the last week.</p><p>At Snowhill Elementary,Trooper Andrew Sliwoski was posted stood outside the building. “We are happy to be here to help, “ he said “It’s unfortunate, though, that we have to be here.”</p><p>Dan Persinger, 37, who had just dropped off his two children at Snowhill, said he appreciated the police presence. “Tension has been high, and people are nervous,” Mr. Persinger said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The threats began last week after Donald J. Trump mentioned Springfield during the presidential debate, repeating a baseless rumor that Haitian immigrants in the city were abducting and eating household pets.</p><p>Since then, 33 bomb threats have targeted city schools, most recently on Monday when two elementary schools were evacuated because of the threats, Governor DeWine said. City Hall and two hospitals in Springfield have also been threatened.</p><p>At a news conference on Monday, Mr. DeWine said that none of the bomb threats so far had “any validity at all.”</p><p>Even so, the threats have shaken the city and disrupted school for thousands of students. The deployment of 36 troopers to the city beginning on Tuesday was intended to allay anxieties and ensure that students can focus on learning.</p><p>“We must take every threat seriously, but children deserve to be in school, and parents deserve to know that their kids are safe,” the governor said. “The added security will help ease some of the fears caused by these hoaxes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Even before Mr. Trump mentioned the rumor during the presidential debate, his running mate, JD Vance, had promoted the rumors about Haitians in Springfield eating pets — claims that city officials have repeatedly refuted.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/us/haitian-migrants-springfield-ohio.html?smid=url-share" title="">Thousands of Haitians have settled in Springfield</a> since the Covid-19 pandemic to fill jobs in the area. Mr. Vance, Ohio’s junior senator, had cited the city in recent months to criticize the Biden administration’s border policies because the newcomers have put pressure on social services, clinics and schools.</p><p>Governor DeWine said the troopers would be at 17 school buildings on Tuesday, checking all school sites before the start of classes and staying on campus throughout the day and after dismissal.</p><p>He said investigators had determined that many of the bomb threats originated outside the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ohio state troopers outside Springfield City Hall on Thursday after bomb threats were made earlier in the day.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roberto Schmidt/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Many of these threats are coming in from overseas, made by those who want to fuel the current discord surrounding Springfield,” Mr. DeWine said in a statement. “We cannot let the bad guys win.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In a statement, the Springfield City School District’s superintendent, Dr. Bob Hill, denounced the threats and the effects on students. “Our students, staff and school community do not deserve to have their daily schedules disrupted by senseless threats of violence,” he said.</p><p>Higher education institutions in Springfield also have endured threats and disruptions.</p><p>Classes at Wittenberg University were held remotely on Monday after a spate of threats by email that targeted the Haitian community, according to a statement from the liberal-arts college.</p><p>Clark State College also announced that classes would be held remotely and all activities rescheduled this week after it received threats.</p><p>The city said on Monday that it would cancel an annual festival, called CultureFest, planned for Sept. 27 and 28, over safety concerns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Vance, who first repeated the rumors, said on CNN over the weekend that he had received many “firsthand” accounts from his constituents.</p><p>He rejected any suggestion that by repeating the falsehoods he had helped prompt the threats, and he said that he condemned violence.</p><p>“All that I’ve done is surface the complaints of my constituents, people who are suffering because of Kamala Harris’s policies,” he said. “Are we not allowed to talk about these problems because some psychopaths are threatening violence?”</p><p>Later, Mr. Vance, said, “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.”</p><p>Kevin Williams<!-- --> contributed reporting from Ohio.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Miriam Jordan reports from a grass roots perspective on immigrants and their impact on the demographics, society and economy of the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan">More about Miriam Jordan</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>America’s Brutal Visa Lottery: </strong>For Chinese seeking educational opportunity, the United States has long been the top spot, but as more want to stay to work, their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/business/chinese-h1b-visa.html">paths are full of roadblocks</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Migrant Family’s Struggles: </strong>Margarita Solito and her family fled violence and poverty in El Salvador, hoping to build a better life in San Francisco.
