To get the vessel floating again, engineers toiling under the do-or-die mantra of their leader, Kim Jong-un, turned to an old-fashioned solution.</p><p>Lacking the machinery to easily lift the 5,000-ton ship, a Choe Hyun-class destroyer, they used big balloons and deployed hundreds of workers, according to analysts and satellite images.</p><p>On Thursday, two weeks after the accident, the 470-foot-long vessel was visible in an upright position in the harbor of Chongjin on North Korea’s northeastern coast. It was floating about 580 feet away from the ramp where it had failed to launch properly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Planet Labs</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In most developed countries, including South Korea, engineers would have used a barge with a gigantic crane to lift the ship and set it right, said Hong Min, an expert on the North Korean military at the Seoul-based Korea Institute for National Unification.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Another common method of righting a capsized ship is called parbuckling. That technique was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/world/europe/operation-to-raise-costa-concordia-cruise-liner-in-italy.html" title="">memorably deployed in 2013</a> on the 951-foot-long Italian cruise liner, the Costa Concordia, which toppled after hitting rocks in Giglio, Italy.</p><p>This time-lapse video shows cables pulling the ship and metal tanks welded to its side. These tanks gradually fill with water, adding to the rotational force and helping the ship return to its original position.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/06vid-nk-ship-31742-cover/06vid-nk-ship-31742-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/06vid-nk-ship-31742-cover/06vid-nk-ship-31742-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/06/06/141532_1_06vid-nk-ship-31742_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>It appears engineers working on North Korea’s ill-fated warship did not have such modern machinery or resources. In a <a href="https://www.38north.org/2025/06/quick-take-chongjin-destroyer-returned-upright/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> published by 38 North, a research institute at the <a href="https://www.stimson.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stimson Center,</a> a U.S. think tank, analysts said the effort was a “manual process.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The process apparently worked. Satellite imagery from May 29 shows hundreds of people on the quay lined up alongside rows of what appear to be cables connected to the vessel, suggesting they used brute force to begin pulling the ship upright. There were also more than two dozen blimp-shaped balloons, each around 16 feet long, surrounding the top of the vessel to help increase its buoyancy.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Analysts said the rubber inflatables may also have been used to keep cables afloat when engineers wrapped them around the ship.</p><p>A major obstacle, the experts said, was how the ship was positioned after its failed launch, with its bow still stuck on the launch ramp. Rolling it over on land could have further damaged the destroyer, the pride of Mr. Kim’s ambitious plan to modernize and expand his Soviet-era naval fleet, and engineers most likely factored this risk into their salvage plans.</p><p>Mr. Hong said a floating crane may have lifted the ship’s bow while humans pulled the rest of the vessel to get it upright. Satellite imagery of the floating warship shows a crane barge near where the ship’s bow had been.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Planet Labs</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On Friday, North Korea said the ship was under inspection and would be taken 42 miles up the coast to Rason, where it would be repaired in a dry dock for seven to 10 days. “The perfect restoration of the destroyer will be completed without fail” before a ruling Workers’ Party meeting late this month, state media said.</p><p>South Korean experts questioned the ship’s seaworthiness. When a warship is launched, it normally goes through months of testing before being formally handed over to a country’s navy. But when North Korea successfully launched its first Choe Hyon guided missile destroyer from a shipyard on its west coast in April, it began test-launching missiles from the ship a few days later for propaganda purposes.</p><p>Choi Il, a retired South Korean Navy captain, said the toppled warship episode had been a huge embarrassment for Mr. Kim. “The whole process of the second destroyer — launching it sideways, it ending up on its side, the North resorting to humans to pull the ship upright from the shore — has revealed a stumbling block in his efforts to turn his Navy from a littoral to blue-water force.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.</p></div><div><p>Jiawei Wang is a video journalist for The New York Times based in Seoul.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
