The company reported a 13 percent increase in March sales on Monday compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Ford Motor said Monday that its March sales at dealerships rose 19 percent. However, Ford’s sales during the overall quarter slipped 1 percent, to about 500,000 vehicles, because of a decline in sales to fleet customers, the company said.</p><p>General Motors did not provide a separate figure for March, but reported that sales in the first quarter rose 17 percent from a year earlier, to 693,000 vehicles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump said last week that he would impose 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles, effective Thursday. The tariffs will be extended to imported auto parts on May 3. Many cars made in U.S. factories contain parts made abroad, frequently exceeding 50 percent of the vehicle’s value. Analysts estimate that carmakers will have to increase prices of some models by more than $10,000 to compensate for the new levies.</p><p>Several carmakers reported sharp increases in sales of electric vehicles and hybrids, while sales of cars powered solely by internal combustion engines rose more modestly or declined.</p><p>G.M. said its sales of vehicles powered just by batteries had almost doubled, to 32,000 cars, as the electric version of the Equinox sport utility vehicle became widely available. With a starting price of about $35,000, the Equinox is one of the most affordable electric vehicles available in the United States.</p><p>Toyota said sales of hybrids and electric vehicles in its North American unit rose 44 percent in March, to 113,000 vehicles, and accounted for almost half of total sales. Toyota dominates the market for hybrids but is a relatively small player in fully electric vehicles.</p><p>Ford said that sales of hybrid vehicles during the first quarter had risen 33 percent and that sales of electric vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E had risen 12 percent. Sales of cars with internal combustion engines fell 5 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hyundai said quarterly sales of hybrids had soared 68 percent while sales of pure electric vehicles had risen 3 percent. And BMW said sales of its electric vehicles had risen 26 percent in the United States. Including BMW cars with internal combustion engines, the German company’s U.S. sales rose 4 percent in the first quarter.</p><p>Mr. Parker of Hyundai said he could not estimate what impact tariffs would have on the company’s prices. Hyundai and its sister company, Kia, have factories in Georgia and Alabama, but they import substantial numbers of vehicles from South Korea.</p><p>“We haven’t made any firm decisions yet,” Mr. Parker said. But he added, “Don’t wait to buy tomorrow what you can buy today.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-ewing">More about Jack Ewing</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Car Shoppers Flock to Beat Trump Tariffs<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/general-motors">General Motors</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tariffs and Chinese Factories</strong>: President Trump’s policies are straining trade ties and, as one factory owner’s struggles show, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/business/trump-tariffs-china-factory.html">challenging a long-held truth in China</a> about the centrality of the U.S. market.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Global Trade War Game: </strong>Two dozen trade experts gathered recently to simulate how a global trade war would play out. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/business/economy/trump-trade-war-game.html">The results were surprisingly optimistic</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Italian Wines on Hold: </strong>For now, President Trump’s 200 percent tariff on wine remains just a threat.
