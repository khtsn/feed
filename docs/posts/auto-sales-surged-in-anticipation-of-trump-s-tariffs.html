    <h1>Auto Sales Surged in Anticipation of Trump’s Tariffs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Trump said last week that he would impose 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles, effective Thursday. The tariffs will be extended to imported auto parts on May 3. Many cars made in U.S. factories contain parts made abroad, frequently exceeding 50 percent of the vehicle’s value. Analysts estimate that carmakers will have to increase prices of some models by more than $10,000 to compensate for the new levies.</p><p>G.M., Ford and Hyundai reported increases in sales of electric vehicles and hybrids. G.M. said its sales of vehicles powered solely by batteries had almost doubled, to 32,000 cars, as the electric version of the Equinox sport utility vehicle became widely available. With a starting price of about $35,000, the Equinox is one of the most affordable electric vehicles available in the United States.</p><p>Ford said that sales of hybrid vehicles had risen 33 percent and that sales of electric vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E had risen 12 percent. Sales of cars with internal combustion engines during the quarter fell 5 percent.</p><p>Hyundai said sales of hybrids had soared 68 percent while sales of pure electric vehicles had risen 3 percent.</p><p>Mr. Parker of Hyundai said he could not estimate what impact tariffs would have on the company’s prices. Hyundai and its sister company, Kia, have factories in Georgia and Alabama, but they import substantial numbers of vehicles from South Korea.</p></div></div>
