name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Mexico passed into law on Sunday a constitutional amendment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/americas/mexico-courts-overhaul-states-approve.html" title="">remaking its entire judiciary</a>, marking the most far-reaching overhaul of a country’s court system ever carried out by a major democracy.</p><p>The results demonstrate the exceptional influence of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/world/americas/mexico-judicial-changes-analysis.html" title="">who championed the legislation</a>. The victory of his allies in June elections afforded them substantial legislative majorities to advance the contentious proposal in the leader’s final weeks in office. On the eve of Mexico’s Independence Day, the measure was published in the government’s official gazette, making it law.</p><p>The law shifts the judiciary from an appointment-based system, largely grounded in training and qualifications, to one where voters elect judges and there are fewer requirements to run. That puts Mexico onto an untested course, the consequences of which are difficult to foresee.</p><p>“Now it’s different,” Mr. López Obrador said in a video posted on social media on Sunday night in which his successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, was seated next to him. “Now it’s the people who rule, the people who decide.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Roughly 7,000 judges, from the chief justice of the Supreme Court down to those at local courts, will have to run for office under the new system. The changes will be put into effect gradually, with a large portion of the judiciary up for election in 2025 and the rest in 2027.</p><p>The government said the overhaul was needed to modernize the courts and to instill trust in a system plagued by graft, influence peddling and nepotism. Ms. Sheinbaum, takes office on Oct. 1 and has fully backed the plan.</p><p>But the proposal was met fierce resistance from judicial workers, law experts, investors, judges, students, opposition legislators and other critics. Mr. López Obrador’s vow to push it through kept financial markets on edge and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/americas/mexico-us-pause-relations.html" title="">caused a diplomatic spat</a> with the U.S. and Canadian ambassadors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, center, with his successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, in Mexico City on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sashenka Gutierrez/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. López Obrador first presented his idea of overhauling the judiciary last year. Angered by Supreme Court rulings that blocked some of his administration’s plans, among them <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/world/americas/mexico-electoral-bill-supreme-court.html" title="">weakening Mexico’s electoral watchdog agency</a> and putting the National Guard under the military’s control, he vowed to have judges and justices elected by popular vote. That move seen as retaliation by some analysts.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The judiciary is hopeless, it is rotten,” he <a href="https://www.gob.mx/insabi/es/articulos/conferencia-de-prensa-del-presidente-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-del-09-de-mayo-de-2023?idiom=es" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a> back then, calling on his supporters to give his political movement large majorities in Congress at the polls in order to pass the overhaul and change the constitution.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/americas/mexico-judicial-overhaul-controversy.html" title="">protests</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/americas/mexico-judges-strike.html" title="">strikes</a> by a range of groups including more than 50,000 judges and court workers over the past several weeks, the proposal passed easily through the lower house of Congress, in which the president’s party, Morena, holds a supermajority. On Wednesday, the Senate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/world/americas/mexico-judical-overhaul-senate-vote.html" title="">narrowly passed</a> it despite a delay caused by protesters forcing their way into the building.</p><p>By Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/americas/mexico-courts-overhaul-states-approve.html" title="">the bill was approved</a> by a majority of the 32 state legislatures, the final requirement before being <a href="https://www.dof.gob.mx/index_111.php?year=2024&amp;month=09&amp;day=15#gsc.tab=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published into law</a>.</p><p>“Mission accomplished,” Gerardo Fernández Noroña, the president of the Senate, <a href="https://x.com/fernandeznorona/status/1834779082959339920" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Friday, announcing that the measure had been sent to Mr. López Obrador for publication.</p><p>Many Mexicans have expressed support for the measure, saying it would give them leverage in a court system that few trust.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>According to government surveys, 66 percent of Mexicans perceive judges to be corrupt, and analysts say nepotism <a href="https://contralacorrupcion.mx/web/magistrados/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remains rife</a>. A <a href="https://www.scjn.gob.mx/sites/default/files/agenda/documento/2024-09/reforma-integral-al-sistema-de-justicia-en-mexico.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent assessment</a> found that about 37 percent of judicial officials have at least one family member working in the courts.</p><p>Now comes the complicated part.</p><p>The Senate will have to issue a call for candidates for the thousands of judgeships nationwide. And Mexico’s electoral agency would have to start organizing the judicial elections. At some point, state legislatures would modify their local constitutions.</p><p>The plan is for voters next June to elect all the Supreme Court justices, whose number would be reduced to nine; members of the newly created Disciplinary Tribunal; and about half of the country’s 7,000 judges, with the rest elected in 2027. An average Mexican might have to sift through anywhere from hundreds to thousands of candidates when they vote.</p><p>Miriam Castillo<!-- --> contributed research from Mexico City.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>James Wagner covers Latin America, including sports, and is based in Mexico City.
