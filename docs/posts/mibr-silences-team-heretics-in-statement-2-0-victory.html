<p>Despite contentious words being exchanged between the two teams since the beginning of the year, this was their first time ever playing each other, finally colliding on the Champions stage after both teams flamed out at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. In a statement win, MIBR defeated Heretics in a convincing 2-0, settling the score between them to move forward in the upper bracket.</p>

</span> in the group stage. Reading into Heretics&#39; tendencies on defense, they masterfully took advantage of the open space left by their opponents in Mid and A, which along with some crucial duels enabled them to take an early 5-1 lead. Heretics attempted to adapt, investing both of their timeouts, but MIBR stayed in control for the rest of the half to go up 8-4.</p>

<p>Undeterred, Heretics quickly pulled the score back to 9-9, converting the bonus with a Stinger buy and consistently winning out postplants on narrow margins. MIBR at one point seemed to recover, reaching 12-10 after locking down the A site, but <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> found key kills in two chaotic rounds to keep Heretics alive and force overtime. </p>


<p><em>MiniBoo keeps his team alive after an all-out brawl on the B site.</em></p>

<p>Heretics again invested both timeouts in an attempt to rally back, but <span data-ref-id="8">

Heretics were constantly forced to play at a man disadvantage, collecting ten first deaths between them in a single half that ended 9-3 in favor of MIBR.</p>


<p><em>aspas&#39; Operator was an unstoppable force on Sunset.</em></p>

<p>This time, there was no hope of any comeback. Heretics delayed the inevitable with a pistol, but MIBR closed out the map with relative ease for a 13-6 win. aspas ended the map with 19 kills to 10 deaths, 185 ADR, and four first kills, <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/5395/cortezia">

</span> said when asked about his and MIBR&#39;s recent success in the post-match interview. “We&#39;re all comfortable with how we play together, so it just makes the game really simple.”</p>

<p>The underdog story continues for MIBR; they carry the torch for Brazil deeper into the tournament, where they will next play the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542267/nrg-vs-giantx-valorant-champions-2025-ubqf" target="_blank">NRG versus GIANTX</a>.
