It has rarely, if ever, acknowledged Israeli military activity on Iranian territory.</p><p>Residents of Tehran reported hearing explosions in and around the city.</p><p>Israel did not immediately say where or how the strikes were being carried out.</p><p>During an earlier exchange of airstrikes in April, Israel waited only about five days to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/world/middleeast/iran-israel-strike-tensions.html" title="">respond to an Iranian attack similar to Tehran’s Oct. 1</a> attack.</p><p>But various factors seem to have dictated a longer lead-up to a response this time, including talks between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/biden-netanyahu-israel-hamas-war.html" title="">Israel and the Biden administration</a>, the arrival of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/middleeast/israel-thaad-missile-defense.html" title="">U.S. air defense system</a> and the Jewish holidays.

Iran has used a network of allied groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah, to attack Israeli interests, and Israel has assassinated senior Iranian officials and nuclear scientists and staged cyberattacks against Iran. The conflict between them burst into the open this year, in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks last year by Hamas on Israel.</p><p>In April, Iran launched a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel — its first direct attack on the country — in retaliation for an Israeli strike on an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/world/middleeast/iran-commanders-killed-syria-israel.html" title="">Iranian Embassy compound</a> in Syria’s capital, Damascus, that killed three top Iranian commanders. Israel largely thwarted the Iranian missile barrage using its air defenses, assisted by the United States and other allies, and then responded with an attack of its own.</p><p>Then, in late July, Israeli jets killed a top commander of Hezbollah in Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, in retaliation for a rocket attack that killed at least 12 people. One day later, Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an explosion in Tehran.</p><p>The Iranian government and Hezbollah vowed to retaliate but, to the surprise of many, Iran took no immediate action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It launched a missile barrage at Israel on Oct. 1, which the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said was in retaliation for the assassinations of Mr. Haniyeh; Hezbollah’s leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">Hassan Nasrallah</a>, late last month; and an Iranian commander.</p><h2 id="link-9ecebc5">What were Israel’s potential targets?</h2><p>After severely weakening the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and Hamas, Israel was trying to balance its strategic goals with concerns from its allies, particularly the United States, that a new attack could set off a wider regional war.</p><p>The Israeli government had told the Biden administration that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-news#israel-tells-the-us-that-it-wont-target-nuclear-sites-during-its-initial-retaliation-against-iran-officials-say" title="">it would avoid striking Iran’s nuclear enrichment and oil production sites</a>, two officials said earlier this month. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, said that Israel had agreed to focus its attack on military targets in Iran.</p><p>As of early Saturday in Iran, it was unclear what targets Israel did or did not strike.</p><p>Avoiding nuclear or oil infrastructure sites may reduce the likelihood of an all-out war between the two adversaries, which would be devastating for the region.
