His return to the White House has been as much a coronation as an inauguration, a reflection of his own view of power and the fear it has instilled in his adversaries.</p><p>His inaugural events have been suffused with regal themes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration.html" title="">In his Inaugural Address</a>, he claimed that when a gunman opened fire on him last summer, he “was saved by God to make America great again,” an echo of the divine right of kings. He invoked the imperialist phrase “manifest destiny,” declared that he would unilaterally rename mountains and seas as he sees fit and even claimed the right to take over territory belonging to other nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>At an event with supporters at Capital One Arena, he introduced his relatives one at a time as if presenting the royal family, and he stood elevated on a platform looking down on supporters who were brought onto stage.
