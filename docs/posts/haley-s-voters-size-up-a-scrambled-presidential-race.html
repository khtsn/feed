Trump.</p><p>With Mr. Trump as the nominee, now is Ms. Haley’s voters’ time for choosing, as she was so fond of saying on the campaign trail, echoing a Ronald Reagan line.</p><p>Many of Ms. Haley’s most ardent supporters in her losing bid — moderate, college-educated Republicans and independents skeptical of Mr. Trump — fell into what pollsters called the “double haters” camp: people dreading having to cast a ballot for Mr. Trump or President Biden, before he ended his re-election campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris’s acceptance of the Democratic nomination last month has changed the math.</p><p>“Neither one of these candidates is exactly a perfect fit for those voters,” Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster, said of Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump. “The Haley voters, I think, are examining the Harris candidacy, and they are going to decide where they fall eventually.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and the United Nations ambassador under Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/haley-endorses-trump.html" title="">formally endorsed him in July</a> at the party’s nominating convention, urging her supporters to set aside their disagreements and stand united as Republicans. That same month, lawyers representing her presidential campaign sent <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/haley-voters-for-harris-cease-and-desist-nikki-haley-kamala-harris/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a cease-and-desist letter</a> to a political action committee that called itself <a href="https://x.com/haleyvte4harris/status/1816574339090907463?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Haley Voters for Harris</a>. In a statement, she said that any attempt to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/23/g-s1-12998/haley-voters-for-harris-cease-desist-2024-election" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">use her name</a> to support Ms. Harris was “deceptive and wrong.”</p><p>Yet many of those who supported her in the race tend to be anti-Trump, and saw her candidacy as a principled stand against the former president and his transformation of his party. Though she herself never embraced the anti-Trump label, she sharply criticized him as “unhinged” while she was still running, and once said of him that she felt “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/us/politics/haley-not-dropping-out.html" title="">no need to kiss the ring</a>.” Even after Ms. Haley <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/us/politics/nikki-haley-drops-out-trump.html" title="">suspended her campaign in March</a>, she drew notable percentages of independents, Republicans and moderate Democrats in primary contests.</p><p>In the Republican primary in April in Pennsylvania, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/23/us/elections/results-pennsylvania-primary.html" title="">25 percent of voters</a> in Montgomery County, just north of Philadelphia, cast their ballots for Ms. Haley, including Ms. Kapralick and Ms. Barone. Both said they appreciated Ms. Haley for her more traditional Republican tone. Now, their divergent November plans capture the split that could help sway the results in their state and other battlegrounds.</p><p>Ms. Barone, 57, a real estate agent, is planning to support Mr. Trump, prioritizing her desire for conservative policies on the border, law enforcement and military issues.</p><p>“I don’t like either candidate, so I think you have to take out the person,” Ms. Barone said, adding that she did not trust Ms. Harris’s appeals to centrists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ms. Kapralick, 62, on the other hand, said she did not want Mr. Trump anywhere near the Oval Office again. She admired former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming<strong><em> </em></strong>for standing up to him and had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/dnc-republicans.html" title="">watched the speeches from prominent Republicans</a>, including former Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, at the Democratic National Convention. She said she had been swayed by their message that a vote for Ms. Harris was a vote to protect democracy and did not make them Democrats.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Linda Kapralick voted for Ms. Haley in the primary in Pennsylvania, even though the politician had already ended her bid for the Republican nomination.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I’m too nervous about what he might do to our country,” she said of Mr. Trump. “I have three children. I want them to grow up in a democracy like we did.”</p><p>Ms. Haley’s voters were not all double haters, pollsters and strategists said. Surveys <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/haley-voters-trump-gop-biden-analysis/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of her supporters</a> from the Monmouth University Polling Institute found that on average one in five had a favorable opinion of Mr. Trump — and about one in 10 approved of Mr. Biden’s job performance.</p><p>Still, there is overlap between the two camps, and recent polling suggests the new presidential field has greatly reduced the number of double haters, with Ms. Harris seeing some significant early advantages. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/25/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> in July found Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/upshot/poll-kamala-harris-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-E0.hGWO.B_KIl1-KZlda&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top" title="">receiving boosts</a> as the number of voters who disliked both candidates plunged to 8 percent, down from 20 percent in earlier Times/Siena polls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Harris campaign officials and allies said they were under no illusions that they could win the majority of Haley supporters, many of whom consider themselves Republicans first and have never voted for a Democrat. But they said they were nonetheless heavily courting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/24/us/politics/nikki-haley-voters-trump-biden.html" title="">swing bloc</a>, knowing that any difference could matter at the margins.</p><p>Olivia Troye, a former top homeland security aide to Vice President Mike Pence who was among the Republicans to speak at the Democrats’ convention, said she had voted for Ms. Haley in the Virginia primary. She is now working with Republicans for Harris coalitions, she said, to help create a “permission structure” for other Haley voters and Trump-skeptical Republicans to cross the political aisle.</p><p>“A lot of them are people who align with the more conservative values that I align with as a lifelong conservative,” Ms. Troye said. “While party identity is certainly very real, I think part of this moment is to take a stand with our traditional Republican vote.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olivia Troye, a former Trump administration official, spoke at the Democratic National Convention last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The fight for Haley voters is especially heated in Pennsylvania, which candidates and surrogates from both campaigns have been crisscrossing in recent weeks. The Harris camp opened its 50th Pennsylvania office over Labor Day weekend. Sixteen of those 50 offices are in rural counties that Mr. Trump won by <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/pennsylvania/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">double digits</a> in 2020.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In Montgomery County, Andrea Fellerman Kesack, a clinical pathologist, longtime Republican and volunteer with the Harris campaign, said it had been “a hard slog” to sway members of her party. But she sees her mission as critical to preserving reproductive rights and to stopping the erosion of democratic norms and the promotion of xenophobia.</p><p>Ms. Haley “was not dealing in racist epithets, she was not lying, she was presenting cogent, thoughtful arguments for the way forward and not airing past grievances,” said Dr. Fellerman Kesack, contending that she found Ms. Harris — and not Mr. Trump — now in line with those values.</p><p>Trump campaign officials and allies describe their movement as unified. And they cite endorsements from Ms. Haley; former Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a onetime Democrat; and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped his independent presidential bid last month, as evidence that they are picking up supporters.</p><p>Outside a grocery store in Lansdale, Pa., John Kohr, 73, a mechanical designer, accused Ms. Harris of “flip-flopping” between progressive and centrist stances, saying he did not believe she could do the job of president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Kohr supported Ms. Haley for president in the primaries, but plans to vote for former President Donald J.
