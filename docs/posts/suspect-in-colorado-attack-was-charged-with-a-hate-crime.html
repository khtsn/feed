Twelve people were injured, including eight who were hospitalized with burns, officials said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/us/boulder-colorado-attack-witness.html" title="">Witnesses described “horrible” scenes.</a></p><p>The F.B.I. said the man, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, told investigators that he had been planning the attack for a year and that he wanted to “kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead.” Police said he had brought more than a dozen incendiary devices to the event and disguised himself as a gardener in order to get as close as possible to the marchers.</p><p>Soliman, who is 45, entered the U.S. from Egypt in 2022 and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/visa-overstays-colorado-attack.html" title="">stayed illegally</a> after his visa expired in 2023. He told a detective that he used Molotov cocktails in the attack because he had not been able to buy a gun.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Mcgrath/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-57f94ca6">Ukraine peace talks yielded little after intense attacks</h2><p>Negotiations in Istanbul today between Russian and Ukrainian officials produced little progress beyond <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-istanbul-talks.html" title="">an agreement to exchange prisoners and the bodies of fallen soldiers</a>. It was the second round of peace talks since the two sides resumed direct dialogue two weeks ago.</p><p>As discussions have sputtered, attacks on the battlefield have intensified. Yesterday, Russia bombarded Ukraine with some of the biggest drone and missile attacks of the war, including a barrage of 500 drones and decoys.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The same day, Ukraine launched an ambitious, coordinated attack that damaged or destroyed long-range bombers located deep within Russia. Ukrainian officials said that the drones used in the attack were hidden in transport containers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-strikes.html" title="">launched from semi trucks</a>.</p><p><strong>In Britain, </strong>Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/uk-defense-review-starmer-nuclear-submarines.html" title="">bring his country to “war-fighting readiness,”</a> citing “growing Russian aggression.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Polls opened at 6 a.m. in South Korea. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jun Michael Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-327b5db0">South Korea is voting for a new leader</h2><p>It is already Tuesday in South Korea, and voters there <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/asia/south-korean-election-president.html" title="">are heading to the polls to elect a new president</a>. Surveys suggest that Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the centrist Democratic Party, is the favorite to win.

Whichever candidate wins will face a country in crisis. “South Korea is deeply divided between generations, and between young men and women,” our Seoul bureau chief Choe Sang-hun said. “The economic growth rate has sputtered to a snail’s pace. The income gap is larger than ever.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-2ab5300d">Coffee was linked to healthy aging</h2><p>If you&#39;re at all like me, you probably don’t hesitate to reach for a third, fourth or fifth cup of coffee on any given day.

That makes him the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/style/jonathan-anderson-dior.html" title="">first designer to unite all sides of the brand since Christian Dior himself</a>.</p><p>Anderson’s appointment signifies the end of one of the most drawn-out succession dramas in modern fashion history. And, as our critic Vanessa Friedman explained, it could be a broader paradigm shift. Taking on both the men’s and women’s lines — 10 collections a year for a $9 billion brand — is an immense burden, and Anderson will be expected to help revive the fashion world from its sluggish state.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chantal Anderson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-367932c4">Shirley Manson has become the godmother of rock</h2><p>As the frontwoman of Garbage, Shirley Manson has continued to carry the torch for the alternative, female-led rock music of the 1990s.
