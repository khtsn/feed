The Fire Department lifted the warning a few hours later.</p><p>“Air support and other aggressive actions have been deployed to fight a new fire just east of the 405,” Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said in a statement. </p><p>Though firefighters had managed to stop the blaze’s growth, it was still zero percent contained and burning through extremely dry brush on Thursday morning, according to Cal Fire. No structures had been burned, officials said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On social media, people posted pictures and videos of drivers stopping along roads to photograph the blaze. The 405 is the country’s busiest highway. </p><p>The same area saw a devastating blaze in 2017, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/california-fires.html" title="">the Skirball fire burned 475 acres</a> and destroyed multiple mansions, including one owned by Rupert Murdoch. </p><p>The Sepulveda fire is adding more anxiety to a city where the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/california-eaton-palisades-deadliest-fire-worst.html" title="">Palisades and Eaton fires</a> are still burning, two weeks after destroying entire neighborhoods and killing at least 27 people. </p><p>On Wednesday, amid continuing dangerous fire conditions in the region, another blaze, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/hughes-wildfire-california-los-angeles.html" title="">the Hughes fire</a>, broke out and quickly spread to more than 10,000 acres near Santa Clarita, northwest of downtown Los Angeles. That blaze forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate and several schools and businesses to close temporarily. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Los Angeles area on Thursday was expecting more low humidity and dry desert winds that have fueled the fires, with winds peaking around 9 a.m., according to the National Weather Service. Over the weekend, the weather pattern is expected to change, and Los Angeles may see some rain, the service said. </p><p>Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mike Ives is a reporter for The Times based in Seoul, covering breaking news around the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-ives">More about Mike Ives</a></span></p></div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
