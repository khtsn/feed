    <h1>Putin Oversees Nuclear Training Exercises at Delicate Moment for Ukraine War</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“We have no interest in being sucked into a new arms race, however, we will maintain our nuclear forces at an adequate level of preparation,” he said in remarks carried by Russia state media. “We will continue to perfect all of their components. We have the resources for it.”</p><p>In particular, Mr. Putin said, Russia will invest in a new generation of nuclear-armed cruiser submarines, long-distance bombers and mobile missile launchers.</p><p>Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Putin has repeatedly used military training exercises to emphasize his country’s nuclear prowess. Military analysts have said his focus on weapons of mass destruction is aimed at offering reassurances to a domestic audience amid the uneven performance of Russian troops in Ukraine, and at deterring Western nations from providing more advanced weapons to Ukraine.</p><p>The Kremlin has repeatedly signaled that moves by Western nations to send Ukraine ever more advanced weapons raised the risk of a direct confrontation with Russia. Ukraine has dismissed such concerns as a bluff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-incursion-zelensky.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">and pointed to the Kremlin’s lack</a> of a discernible response to deliveries of Western weapons previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/europe/biden-ukraine-strike-russia.html?searchResultPosition=10" title="">considered taboo</a>, such as fighter jets, as evidence.</p></div></div>
