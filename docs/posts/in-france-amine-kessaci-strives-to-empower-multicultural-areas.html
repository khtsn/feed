In a voice that was simultaneously calm and combative, he urged Mr. Macron to be more inclusive in his decision-making.</p><p>“There is no point to come with a plan from Paris drafted on a plane, or I don’t know where. You have to build it with us,” he told Mr. Macron, who did not respond to the substance of Mr. Kessaci’s comment, simply <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/faits-divers/criminalite-a-marseille/video-marseille-la-jeunesse-reve-encore_4773165.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asking him his age and then slightly applauding</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Less than three years later, Mr. Kessaci (pronounced keh-ssah-see) ran for a National Assembly seat as a candidate of the Green Party, part of the left-wing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/world/europe/france-left-new-popular-front.html" title="">New Popular Front</a> coalition. He narrowly lost — by 835 votes — in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/world/europe/france-election-results-left-surges.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">snap legislative elections</a> in July to <a href="https://www.resultats-elections.interieur.gouv.fr/legislatives2024/ensemble_geographique/93/13/1303/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gisèle Lelouis</a>, 72, a member of the far-right National Rally party.

Elected or not, he is representative of citizens from immigrant backgrounds who are agitating to be heard and included, and who aspire to corridors of power long dominated by elites.</p><p>The legislative campaigns defined the competing visions for France’s future. The National Rally, even as it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/world/europe/france-national-rally-rebranding.html" title="">softened some of its most incendiary language</a>, has taken a hard line on immigration. It often argues that immigration is linked to crime and threats to French identity, though France does not keep statistics based on ethnicity.</p><p>In Mr. Kessaci’s constituency, the <a href="https://marsactu.fr/noyaux-villageois-contre-cites-le-duel-a-distance-entre-gisele-lelouis-et-amine-kessaci/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vote is typically split</a> between villages outside Marseille that tend to support the far right and multicultural urban areas like Mr. Kessaci’s, where disillusionment has suppressed voter turnout.</p></div></div><div><p>His campaign message was simple: He understood the daily experiences of lower-income voters, especially younger ones, and he was committed to pushing for change, especially for those living in the working-class neighborhoods, or “quartiers populaires,” of northern Marseille, where he grew up.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A suburb of Marseille this summer.

But in 2022, they made up only about 32 members of the 577-seat National Assembly, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220625-national-assembly-gradually-reflects-diversity-of-the-french-street" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the news outlet France24</a>, and few have a second-generation immigrant background like Mr. Kessaci’s.</p><p>In the years after World War II, immigrants from Africa — including former colonies and protectorates in the north and west — settled in the quartiers populaires in response to France’s growing need for labor. These were usually areas on the outskirts of major cities that lacked many public services, and came to embody social exclusion and economic disparity.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Kessaci grew up in one of them, in a dilapidated high-rise apartment building in Frais-Vallon, a 15-minute metro ride from Marseille’s center. It remains <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/bases-statistiques-communale-departementale-et-regionale-de-la-delinquance-enregistree-par-la-police-et-la-gendarmerie-nationales/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the most crime-afflicted neighborhoods</a> in all of France.</p><p>Close to the building, where his father still lives, young men in black ski masks can be seen on any given day at checkpoints monitoring who comes and goes, and who might represent a threat to their drug trade.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Working-class neighborhoods, or quartiers populaires, are usually areas on the outskirts of major cities that lack many public services, and have come to embody social exclusion and economic disparity.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“We are the ones who live among real insecurity and yet we are the ones who complain the least,” Mr. Kessaci said about concerns over crime that have fueled support for the far right.</p><p>Rachid Zerrouki, a teacher in Marseille who works with students who are disengaged academically, said he was happy to see someone with Mr. Kessaci’s background get involved in politics.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Representation is important,” Mr. Zerrouki said.</p><p>The desperate economic and social situations these teenagers face, Mr. Zerrouki added, results in many of them being lured away from an education and into drug trafficking.</p><p>“We are struggling to even find internships so that they can imagine a career,” he said about his students. </p><p>Mr. Kessaci has a personal connection to these kinds of problems. In December 2020, Brahim Kessaci, an older sibling, <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/deux-corps-calcines-pres-de-marseille-la-piste-d-un-reglement-de-compte-lie-au-trafic-de-stups-29-12-2020-8416521.php?ts=1720896547550" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was killed</a>, his burned body found in the trunk of a car.

He supports a climate tax on companies that pollute and an increase in the minimum wage.</p><p>At 16, Mr. Kessaci founded Conscience Ecologique, a nonprofit organization with the goal of bringing working-class citizens into the national conversation on sustainability issues.</p><p>“We can fix our problems ourselves,” he said. “We can clean our neighborhoods. We are capable of doing it. We are young people who read, who have ideas, who do something other than drugs.”</p></div></div><div><p>The organization, now called Conscience, is run by his mother, Ouassila Benhamdi. Inside its offices, in what used to be a school, there are containers with donated clothes and food and a kitchen for cooking workshops. Conscience also helps people with the paperwork they must fill out to get housing, and offers camping excursions and yoga retreats for grieving parents and others who recently lost a loved one.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kessaci’s mother, Ouassila Benhamdi, right, is now running the nonprofit group he founded.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“I am an example for others,” Ms. Benhamdi said of her work. “Tragedy touched me.
