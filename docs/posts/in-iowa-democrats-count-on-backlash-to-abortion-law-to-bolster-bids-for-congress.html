Given that she was well into her third trimester, her medical team was hesitant to begin the aggressive treatment needed, but she eventually started chemotherapy, had a successful surgery and underwent radiation. She is now in remission and her daughter is healthy.</p><p>That was three years ago, before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Iowa enacted one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, creating new complications for doctors treating pregnant women who face medical emergencies.</p><p>Now, Ms. Magner, a registered independent who grew up in a heavily G.O.P.-leaning family, is going door to door in the competitive Third Congressional District telling her story and trying to persuade her neighbors to vote out Representative Zach Nunn, the Republican incumbent, and elect Democrats up and down the ticket.</p><p>“If that were me today I wouldn’t be alive,” Ms. Magner said in an interview. She has never gotten involved in politics, she added, but she is volunteering this year because “I just felt like I should do something. Even if it doesn’t work, I can tell my girls that I tried.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional seats, Democrats are banking on voters like Ms. Magner to bolster their chances of picking off G.O.P. incumbents in a pair of competitive districts in the southern part of the state, as they push to win the House majority in November.</p><p>At campaign stops and canvassing events and in television ads, they are hoping to harness a backlash to a law that took effect in Iowa in July banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy to target Republican incumbents who have opposed abortion rights. In addition to Mr. Nunn, who once said he believed that all abortions should be illegal in the United States, they are targeting Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who in her first term in Congress cosponsored a bill that would effectively outlaw abortions by giving embryos constitutional rights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maria Magner is telling voters in Iowa’s Third Congressional District about a complicated pregnancy as she campaigns for Lanon Baccam, the Democratic candidate.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">KC McGinnis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“A lot of people thought this would never happen in Iowa, but now we have one of the strictest bans in the country,” said Christina Bohannan, who is challenging Ms. Miller-Meeks in Iowa’s First Congressional District.<em> </em>“It is a huge issue because we had in Iowa a very balanced law for a long time<em>.”</em></p><p>Ms. Bohannan, who lost to Ms. Miller-Meeks in 2022 by more than 20,000 votes, focused her first campaign ad this year on attacking the congresswoman on abortion rights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Iowa now has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country because of Mariannette Miller-Meeks,” she says in the <a href="https://x.com/BohannanIowa/status/1820887338165399592" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spot</a>.
