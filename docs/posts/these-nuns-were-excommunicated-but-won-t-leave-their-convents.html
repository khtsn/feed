In the passenger’s seat was another nun. They sprinted in the white Nissan along a country road lined with sunflower fields and wooden telegraph poles — desperate to save the way of life of their order, the Poor Clares of Belorado, which has been around since 1358, and to retain control of their three convents.</p><p>The Vatican had excommunicated the sisters and a local archbishop had threatened them with eviction because they had broken with the Roman Catholic Church. And though the Poor Clares of Belorado own two of the buildings they live in and had recently signed an agreement to buy a third, the Vatican had appointed a local archbishop to administer their properties and finances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A key to the main door of the Orduña convent.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ana Maria Arevalo Gosen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The frenzied car trip came after the nuns heard that the archbishop was planning to seize spare keys from janitors and change the locks on two of the convents. “They drove like fury,” said Sister María Belén de la Trinidad, 51.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>By the time the two nuns reached the convent called the Derio, the lock on the front door had been changed and the other doors bolted from the inside.

The saga has gripped local residents and called into question who actually controls the convents: the sisters or the Vatican?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“They have taken our bank accounts and want to take our properties, land and donations, too,” said Sister Belén, who entered the order of the Poor Clares at Belorado in 1999. “It’s very hard. But we have to fight.”</p><p>The Vatican did not respond to requests for comment. Natxo de Gamón, director of communications for the Archbishop of Burgos, disputed the nuns’ claims that they are the rightful custodians of the convents and contested many of their recollections of events.</p><p>Secluded, most nuns, including Mother Isabel de la Trinidad, the Abbess of the Belorado order, could not be reached or declined to comment. Sister Belén and Sister Paloma Clara María de Jesús agreed to talk to The New York Times and described themselves as spokeswomen for the excommunicated nuns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The parlor at the Belorado convent is used to receive visitors, with a grille separating the nuns from their guests.

At that time, the Belorado nuns were well-respected in the area and by the church. They were known for their industriousness: They had set up a <a href="https://elobradordelconvento.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lucrative online chocolate truffle workshop</a> at the Belorado convent, selling gift-wrapped sweets to customers as far away as Japan. Proceeds had been used at the turn of the century to finance the restoration of cells on Belorado’s first floor, in a state of disrepair after decades of neglect.</p><p>Nearby, in 2011, a handful of elderly nuns were struggling in the smaller, lesser-known Derio convent. The Most Rev. Mario Iceta, now the Archbishop of Burgos, asked the Belorado nuns to incorporate Derio within the Belorado order and help their less fortunate peers, Sister Belén recalled.</p><p>The idea was that the nuns could turn the Derio — a convent built in the 20th century in a stunning natural enclave — into a spiritual hub, offering board and lodging to religious tourists and attracting generous donations. Mother Isabel de la Trinidad, the Abbess of the Belorado order, dispatched some of the younger nuns, but on arrival at Derio, they found damp walls and rooms infested with insects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The young sisters sent to the Derio had misgivings from the outset. In a written statement to The Times, the nuns said, “There was something strange in the place, something unsettling.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The roof of the Santa Clara Monastery in Orduña was leaking and sinking.

They installed heating under the floor of the church and fixed up rooms in a separate outbuilding that dates to the 17th century.</p><p>But by 2017, Derio had failed to attract worshipers — and the donations — they had hoped for. The Belorado convent was financially drained, and the nuns who had been sent to Derio were physically and mentally exhausted.</p><p>According to Sister Paloma, they began to fall sick. Squabbles broke out. At night, she said, they heard inexplicable sounds — objects being dragged across the roof, babies crying, dismal laughter, footsteps coming and going. Door handles turned with an invisible force. Lights went on and off. Items, such as scissors, moved across tables on their own accord. The nuns were convinced evil was at work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“When you have come face to face with the devil, you know who you are dealing with,” said Sister Paloma, 47. “I was very afraid.”</p><p>The priest at Derio did not provide adequate spiritual guidance, Sister Paloma said. “He celebrated terrible modernist masses,” she said. He gave sermons on “ecology and climate change,” rather than focusing on “saving souls,” she said.</p><p>Sister Belén said exorcisms were attempted in 2018; Mr. de Gamón said he personally had no knowledge of any exorcisms.</p><p>The strange happenings continued, she said, but the nuns continued to try to save the Derio. They found financial reprieve when the local town council granted them permission to rent out the convent’s 17th-century outbuilding as a six-bedroom holiday home for tourists. Before long, they had a steady flow of paying guests.</p><p>“Things were going really well,” Sister Paloma said. “We nearly always had a rating of nine out of 10 on Booking.com.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Then the pandemic hit, everything closed down. In October 2020, the nuns abandoned the Derio convent. “The preternatural experiences we sustained over time made us make the decision to leave, after consulting three exorcists,” they claim in their written statement.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view from the roof of the Monastery of Santa Clara in Orduña, Spain, which the Poor Clares of Belorado bought from another monastic community, the Poor Clares of Vitoria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ana Maria Arevalo Gosen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Out of money and increasingly at odds with the Vatican, Mother Isabel, the Abbess, and her nuns took out a mortgage of €720,000 ($752,000) on the Derio convent and put it on the market. They used €100,000 of the loan for a down payment on an empty medieval property 60 miles north of Belorado — the Orduña convent, which was being sold by another nun community, the Poor Clares of Vitoria. Although convents in Spain belong to the nuns, any sales require authorization from the Vatican, according to Mr. de Gamón.</p><p>“The Holy See has the last word,” Mr. de Gamón said. The Orduña transaction was approved, and the nuns signed a good faith agreement: The Belorado nuns would make regular payments to the Vitoria nuns until the total value of €1.2 million ($1.3 million) was reached.</p><p>The nuns began to recover from their illnesses. Orduña has a vegetable garden and a farmyard, which they tended. Within months, the nuns had used the remaining mortgage money to patch the leaky roof, install solar panels and build a bakery, where they made treats to sell at local markets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Butter sweets and cupcakes made by the Poor Clares of Belorado.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ana Maria Arevalo Gosen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>But with an increase in the global price of cocoa, their truffle business was floundering and the profits from their cakes, fritters and pies sold at local markets was all the income they had. “Priests have salaries, but nuns do not. Nuns need to work,” said Sister Paloma. “Our way of life is work.”</p><p>Struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and their commitments to the Poor Clares of Vitoria, they put hope in selling the Derio convent. In late 2023 when a prospective buyer finally showed an interest, they say, they asked the Vatican to authorize the sale. The request went unanswered, according to Sister Belén.</p><p>The sisters made one last attempt to improve their finances by negotiating the transfer of ownership of Orduña to a benefactor, whose identity they declined to disclose to The Times. Their proposal was rejected by the local archbishop.</p><p>Mr. de Gamón said local church officials found the nuns’ claims that they had potential suitors for a Derio purchase and an Orduña transfer to be dubious. In fact, “we have a suspicion that there was no buyer” for the Derio and that the Orduña benefactor was “not Catholic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>The nuns had hit a financial wall. When the Vatican assigned the Archbishop to handle their finances, “a huge economic black hole,” which ran into tens of thousands of euros, was discovered, Mr. de Gamón said.</p><p>In May, the Poor Clares of Vitoria, who say they have received no payments for the Orduña, demanded it be returned to them. The Belorado nuns, however, refused to sign the cancellation of the good faith agreement, claiming they had spent more than $1.2 million euros fixing up a derelict property. “We couldn’t sign the cancellation of the contract and lose everything,” said Sister María Sión de la Trinidad, 39, a Belorado nun who attended a negotiation meeting.</p><p>Days later, the Belorado nuns published their manifesto.</p><h2 id="link-6b9d4995">The Nuns Won’t Run or Repent</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sister María Belén de la Trinidad and Sister Paloma Clara María de Jesús Varo Navarro in the parlor of the Monastery of Santa Clara de Belorado, in Burgos.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ana Maria Arevalo Gosen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Sixteen nuns renounced the Catholic Church and accused Pope Francis of “usurping the Holy See.” They pledged their allegiance instead to a traditionalist Catholic movement called Sedevacantism, which rejects modernism and claims that all popes since Pius XII, who died in 1958, are illegitimate. The forces aligned against them, they wrote, “cannot do anything against the soul.”</p><p>As the nuns doubled down this summer, they were criticized and mocked in local media. Articles circulated that they had been <a href="https://www.cuatro.com/noticias/sociedad/20240519/monja-salio-convento-clarisas-belorado-habla-secta_18_012525617.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brainwashed by a fascist priest</a> who had been excommunicated in 2019 and is an open admirer of Spain’s former dictator, General Francisco Franco. Sister Belén told The Times that they had turned to him for spiritual counsel in the weeks leading up to their break from the church, but they have since distanced themselves because he is too extreme. “He wanted us to pray on our knees,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Reports about the nuns’ excess spending on luxury items, <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2024/07/06/66895c23e9cf4a4a288b45b1.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">such as silk sheets</a> and <a href="https://www.libertaddigital.com/castilla-leon/2024-07-06/los-exquisitos-gustos-de-la-exabadesa-de-belorado-vive-como-una-marquesa-7144516/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cured hams</a>, also appeared in local media.

The Civil Guard police force declined to respond to multiple requests for comment, but Sister Belén told The Times that the only weapon found was an ancient air rifle that was too rusty to load.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A nun illuminated by the light from a window.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ana Maria Arevalo Gosen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>In June, the remaining 15 nuns failed to appear at a meeting before a church tribunal, so the Vatican excommunicated 10 of them, including Mother Isabel and Sisters Paloma and Belén. </p><p>The five oldest nuns were spared punishment, deemed too cognitively impaired to have signed the manifesto, according to Mr. de Gamón. “Their family members have told us they want to remain within the Catholic church,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>The senior nuns live in the Belorado with Mother Isabel, Sisters Paloma and Belén and three other expellees.

While individual nuns must renounce all earthly possessions, the real estate they live in is often owned by the community the nuns comprise, according to Spanish civil law. The Belorado Convent, for example, has been inscribed in Spain’s Land Registry as belonging to the Poor Clares of Belorado since 1969.</p><p>Despite no longer being recognized by the Vatican, the rebel sisters still form a religious community, according to Mr. Alaez. “The church has no power over a monastic community that declares itself non-Catholic,” he said. “It’s as if a Jewish rabbi tried to govern a community of Buddhists or Muslims.”</p><p>Mr. de Gamón, the church official, said the five elderly nuns who avoided excommunication are now the only legitimate Belorado Poor Clares, and so the properties belong to them, not to any of the expelled nuns. If the Vatican were to sever ties with the senior sisters, ownership of the properties would pass to the larger Spanish Federation of Poor Clares.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mario Iceta, the Archbishop of Burgos, and Sister Carmen Ruiz, the Federal Secretary of the Order of Saint Clare, at a news conference in Burgos, Spain, addressing the excommunication of nuns by the Vatican.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cesar Manso/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>For now, the Archbishop of Burgos has <a href="https://www.archiburgos.es/2024/09/16/comisario-pontificio-interpone-demanda-frente-las-nueve-exreligiosas-belorado/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed an official eviction action</a> in court, claiming the nuns “no longer have legal title to inhabit the buildings belonging to the monasteries they occupied.”</p><p>It may be months, even years, before a ruling is reached in court, according to Mr. Alaez, the lawyer.
