China has been stepping up its activities in the region in recent years, building infrastructure and expanding trade routes that it hopes will boost its economy.</p><p>In central Georgia, workers from China are erecting soaring viaducts and cutting dozens of tunnels through hard rock to build the first modern highway to link the east and west of the country. In the north, a 5.5-mile tunnel is being bored through the mountains by China Railway Tunnel Group to expand an existing highway to Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A highway is under construction in Georgia not far from the old road leading to the Russian border.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justyna Mielnikiewicz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>To the west, preparations are underway for another Chinese company, China Communications Construction Company, to develop Georgia’s first deep-sea port on the Black Sea as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road infrastructure and trade initiative.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The port, as yet unnamed, is now at the center of a debate in Georgia and abroad about China’s growing influence in the region and the Caucasus nation’s pivot away from the West. Inflaming the situation is the fact that the project was stripped from a group of Georgian, European, and U.S. companies — the Anaklia Development Consortium — before eventually being promised to the Chinese company last May.</p><p>Salome Zourabichvili, the former Georgian president who emerged last year as a leading voice for the pro-Western opposition, <a href="https://bm.ge/en/news/presidents-statement-against-chinese-involvement-in-anaklia-port-project-serious-provocation-pm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said the move</a> was like “stabbing our relations with our American and European partners.”</p><p>In July, a State Department official <a href="https://x.com/ralakbar/status/1805240542134997396" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that awarding</a> the port project to the Chinese company was “incompatible” with wanting to join “U.S. and E.U.-based international organizations.” In 2019, the United States had billed the port as something that could “prevent Georgia from falling prey to Russian or Chinese economic influence.”Last week, Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, <a href="https://x.com/RepJoeWilson/status/1897463874892472743" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized the decision</a>, saying it benefited China at the expense of American companies.</p><p>The Georgian government has said that the decision to hand the port to the Chinese company would ensure it was implemented “at the highest level.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Chinese cargoes are of particular importance for the most effective operation of this port,” Irakli Kobakhidze, Georgia’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.interpressnews.ge/en/article/131869-irakli-kobakhidze-the-winning-of-the-tender-by-the-chinese-company-guarantees-that-the-anaklia-project-will-be-implemented-at-the-highest-level/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> shortly after the announcement.</p><p>And some analysts see the country’s pivot away from the West as a rational choice given the geopolitics of the region.</p><p>“Georgia is trying to get more from China, the actor that is getting stronger in the region,” said Dimitri Moniava, head of the Center for Strategic Communications, a research group in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cargo ships moored off the coast of Georgia in the Black Sea.

For Georgia, the port would help develop the country as a regional transport hub.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>For China, the port would become a gateway to the Caucasus, linking Asia with Europe across what it calls the “middle corridor.” It would allow Chinese companies to ship their goods from China via railways in Central Asia and across the Caspian to Europe, skirting Russia, which has been the target of Western sanctions because of the war in Ukraine.</p><p>“Georgia is a key link for the middle corridor and Anaklia port could be the pivotal last nail,” Zhou Qian, China’s ambassador to Georgia, said in an interview. “Georgia’s location is very, very important” for providing “connectivity between Europe and Asia,” he said.</p><p>The Georgian government has said that the details of the deal are still being figured out, but that the Chinese company will own 49 percent of the port, with Georgia holding the rest as a majority stake. The Georgian government says it expects the Chinese construction company to invest $600 million in the first phase.</p><p>China Communications Construction Company did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Russia, which is still considered to be Georgia’s main trading partner, could also be a major beneficiary of the project. Novorossiysk, the main Russian port on the Black Sea, has been hobbled by Western sanctions, and with the new Chinese-built routes, goods could flow into and out of Russia unimpeded across the Caucasus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A historical fortress north of the Georgian capital,Tbilisi.

The party is run behind the scenes by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/business/georgia-oligarch-bidzina-ivanishvili.html" title="">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>, a reclusive oligarch with long ties to Russia. Mr. Khazaradze was elected as an opposition member of Parliament in October but, like other members of the opposition, has been boycotting the legislature.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The largely empty resort town of Anaklia.

The government then opened a criminal case into money laundering against him and his partner, and then canceled the port contract.</p><p>Anaklia Development Consortium fought back in a European arbitration court but last year <a href="https://civil.ge/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ADC-Media-Statement-ICC-Ruling-on-ADC-arbitration-claim-29-July-2024.docx-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost the case,</a> with the court saying the group had “assumed the risk that the government would undermine the project.” Another case in the Netherlands is pending.</p><p>Representatives of the Georgian government did not respond to requests for comment. In the past the government said the Anaklia Development Consortium was dropped because it had insufficient funds to complete the project. (Mr. Khazaradze has denied that.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Khazaradze then founded a political party called Lelo that has been organizing protests against the government, which won an election in October that has been contested by the country’s highly fractured opposition.</p><p>Giorgi Gakharia, who was prime minister when the Anaklia Development Consortium contract was canceled, also said Mr. Khazaradze and his partners did not have enough money to complete the project.</p><p>“They simply couldn’t fulfill their obligations,&#34; said Mr. Gakharia, who has since parted ways with Mr. Ivanishvili and is now siding with the opposition. In an interview, he said there had been no pressure from Mr. Ivanishvili to cancel the project.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rusty boat in Anaklia’s marina.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justyna Mielnikiewicz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>For now, Anaklia remains derelict.

If all goes to plan, the site will be transformed in about six years into a bustling hub for up to 600,000 containers.</p><p>Jemal Kvartskhava, who oversees a few dozen men bringing stones to the site and building accommodation for an expected surge of workers, said he didn’t really care who built the port as long as it becomes operational.</p><p>“This project is good,” said Mr. Kvartskhava, 28. “It will bring new energy to the country.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
