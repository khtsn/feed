Israel said on Tuesday that it had destroyed Syria’s Navy and other military assets in overnight airstrikes, arguing that it needed to keep them out of the hands of militant jihadists.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Opponents of the Assad government demonstrated in Umayyad Square in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Turkey — which backed militias fighting the Assad regime — and another Syrian rebel ally group have seized on the power vacuum, mounting an offensive against the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria.</p><p>At the presidential palace in Damascus on Tuesday, a contingent of rebels stood watch at the gate, keeping out would-be looters and curious civilians. They sleep on couches in a cavernous reception hall.</p><p>Mohammed al-Bashir, a rebel leader affiliated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, announced in a brief address on Syrian television on Tuesday that he was assuming the role of caretaker prime minister until March. 1. A little-known figure in most of the country, Mr. al-Bashir previously served as the head of the administration in rebel-held territory in the northwest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even as the former rebels sought to consolidate power, Syria’s neighbors set out to shore up their own interests. Great powers have fought for centuries for influence in the strategic territory now known as Syria, and the fall of the Assad regime seemed to intensify the interest in the lands stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River and beyond.</p><p>Israeli leaders fear that the Syrian revolution could replace one implacable enemy, the secular Assad regime, with another, one with a specifically religious bent. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, originally an offshoot of Al Qaeda, is labeled a terrorist group by the United States and others. It contends it has moderated and will work with other religious groups, but it has offered few hints about its intentions toward Israel. There are also concerns that the fall of Mr. al-Assad could empower a resurgent Islamic State.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A fighter with the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham looked through objects in a room full of artworks and gifts bestowed on Mr. Assad, at the abandoned Presidential Palace in Damascus on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Israel said on Tuesday that it had carried out 350 airstrikes against Syrian military targets overnight. “We would like to form relations with the new regime in Syria,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.</p><p>Over the weekend, the Israeli military also seized control of a buffer zone in Syria bordering the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said that the rebels “have been sending good messages to the Syrian people,” signaling that they wanted a government of “unity and inclusiveness,” not a theocracy. Israel’s military operations in Syria are “very troubling,” Mr. Pedersen told reporters in Geneva. “This needs to stop.”</p><p>As Syria’s rebels seek to carry out an orderly transition to a new government, he said, it is “extremely important that we don’t see any action from any international actor that destroys the possibility for this transformation in Syria to take place.”</p><p>Armed groups with competing interests are still battling in Syria for territory and power, trying to fill the vacuum left by the collapse of the Assad regime.</p><p>In northern Syria, fierce fighting was underway on Tuesday near the town of Kobani between Turkey-backed rebels, aided by Turkish airstrikes, and the Kurdish-led forces supported by the United States. For years the Kurds have held most of northeastern Syria, while Turkey and its rebel allies have controlled a neighboring piece of Syria along the Turkish border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damage at the Latakia port in Syria after Israel said it had destroyed the Syrian Navy on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bilal Al Hammoud/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>In recent days, the U.S.-backed rebels, who call themselves the Syrian Democratic Forces, have been <a href="https://x.com/Charles_Lister/status/1866154488156856536" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moving into areas</a> vacated by government forces.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The clashes on Tuesday signaled an intensification of a long-running conflict between Turkey and its proxies, and Kurdish forces.

Michael E. Kurilla, who leads the command, had visited U.S. and allied forces at several bases in Syria. The United States, the statement said, remains committed “to the enduring defeat” of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.</p><p>In the Homs region in central Syria, Islamic State forces on Tuesday killed 54 people who had been part of the government’s military and were fleeing, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The United States, which has refused to have direct relations with either Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or the Assad government, on Tuesday stated its hopes for the transition in Syria.</p><p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken laid out a list of expectations for the new government in Damascus, including inclusive and “nonsectarian governance,” respect for the rights of minorities and facilitating the flow of humanitarian aid. Mr. Blinken also said the new government must “prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrian regime soldiers are led by rebel soldiers in Homs, Syria, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bilal Alhammoud/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“The United States will recognize and fully support a future Syria government that results from this process,” Mr. Blinken said. “We stand prepared to lend all appropriate support to all of Syria’s diverse communities and constituencies.”</p><p>The British government said on Tuesday that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham would not be removed from its list of banned terror organizations for now, but that the group’s proscribed status would not prevent Britain from communicating with it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham broke ties with Al Qaeda in 2016 and fought against ISIS, trying to <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/jawlanis-state-union" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gain international legitimacy</a> by casting aside global jihadist ambitions and focusing on organized governance in Syria. But it has also come under criticism for its authoritarian governance of northwestern Syria, where it cracked down on dissent.</p><p>Human rights groups say that more than half a million people, including around 200,000 civilians, died in Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011, but attention has focused on the atrocities committed by Mr. al-Assad’s government.</p><p>The whereabouts of about 136,000 people arrested arbitrarily by the regime is unknown. In many cases, the government did not acknowledge that people had been detained, leaving relatives in the dark, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. At least 15,000 people were tortured to death by the government, the network said.</p><p>Human rights experts say that it will take time to set up Syrian police and court systems capable of rendering justice for such crimes, and that can be done only once security in the country has been established.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Relatives looking in the morgue of Damascus Hospital on Tuesday for the bodies of loved ones believed to have been taken to Sednaya prison.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Since the sudden fall of the Assad regime, residents of Damascus have stormed prisons and government buildings.
