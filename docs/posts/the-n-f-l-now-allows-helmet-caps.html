It’s called a Guardian Cap, and it adds a layer of foam to the outside of the helmet, with the aim of reducing brain injuries.</p><p>N.F.L. players have worn the caps during summer practice for the past few years, but this is the first season the league is allowing them in games. A handful of players wore them during the opening weekend.</p><p>The company behind the caps, Guardian Sports, says they reduce the force of the impact when a player’s head is hit. But what does that mean? And do they protect against concussions?</p><p>Erin Hanson, Guardian’s founder and owner, said an N.F.L. study found that when players used Guardian helmet caps in practice, the number of concussions fell by more than 50 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yet, Guardian also has a disclaimer on its website: “No helmet, practice apparatus or helmet pad can prevent or eliminate the risk of concussions or other serious head injuries while playing sports. Researchers have not reached an agreement on how the results of impact absorption tests relate to concussions.”</p><p>In a telephone interview, Hanson emphasized that it was unrealistic to think that the cap would prevent all concussions.</p><p>“Football is a dangerous collision sport,” she said. “No doubt about it.”</p><p>I asked brain trauma experts to weigh in. What sort of protection can players realistically expect if they wear the helmet caps? Today’s newsletter explains what the extra padding could do for concussions, and for C.T.E., the long-term condition that plagues many players later in life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tua Tagovailoa of the Miami Dolphins, center, suffered a concussion during a game on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lynne Sladky/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1ebb6be1">The trouble with concussions</h2><p>Don’t count on these new helmet caps to protect against concussions, experts said.</p><p>“The problem is that people confuse head injuries with brain injuries,” Dr. Jamshid Ghajar, a neurosurgeon and the president of the Brain Trauma Foundation, told me. “Helmets definitely help with head injuries,” like a fractured skull or injuries to the scalp, he noted, but they don’t help with concussions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Concussions arise when a person’s neck bends and twists after the head is hit. That was apparent on Thursday, when the Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a concussion from a tackle that caused his neck to turn sharply.</p><p>“The neck is very flexible,” Dr. Ghajar said. “Its movement causes the brain injury problem, making the front part of the brain whiplash.” The front of the brain, he added, “is where we see concussions and severe brain injury.”</p><p>Race-car drivers wear helmets that actually protect them from concussions, Dr. Ghajar noted. The helmet holds the neck rigid so it cannot move in a collision. “Drivers have had collisions at over 200 miles per hour and no brain injury,” he said.</p><p>“Helmets and padding work if you have an iron neck,” Dr. Ghajar added.</p><h2 id="link-2bb3a9dc">Tricky data</h2><p>But what about that N.F.L. study of players that Hanson cited, showing a 50 percent reduction?</p><p>“That was a pleasant surprise,” Dr. Javier Cardenas, a senior medical adviser for the N.F.L., told me. It happened two years in a row, he added, which led him to conclude that the caps “definitely” reduced the risk of concussions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, a concussion expert at Massachusetts General Hospital, is not convinced. He noted that the N.F.L.’s study had relied on players reporting their own symptoms, which makes it hard to draw conclusions.</p><p>The problem, Dr. Daneshvar said, is that players may not always recognize symptoms of a concussion, or may ignore them. And if they think their new helmet caps are protecting them, they may be less likely to report a concussion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Carchietta/USA TODAY Sports, via Reuters Con</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-4f64f84f">Hope for C.T.E.</h2><p>C.T.E., or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is the condition that most frightens many football players. It can lead to memory loss and behavioral changes years later. And it results from not just the traumatic impacts that cause concussions, but also the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/sports/football/cte-study-concussions-brain-tackle.html" title="">accumulation of smaller hits to the head</a> that every football player endures.</p><p>The extra padding of helmet caps could, in theory, help reduce that. “Anything that decreases force to the head will decrease the risk of C.T.E.,” Dr. Daneshvar said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Kylen Granson, a tight end for the Indianapolis Colts, has said he plans to wear a helmet cap all season. “I would be remiss in not taking every precaution that’s available to me,” Granson said in a recent Instagram video. “I’m going to get married this coming year. I want to be able to remember our first dance 30 years from now.”</p><p>The N.F.L. has cited a lab study that found Guardian caps reduced force by 10 percent. That “would probably decrease C.T.E. risk,” Dr. Daneshvar said, though he cautioned that the lab study used dummies with rigid necks, which he said created “ideal circumstances to maximize the effect.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for the N.F.L. defended the research, which she said had used modern, biofedelic dummies designed to more accurately reflect human biology.</p><p>“My analogy would be a filtered cigarette,” Dr. Daneshvar said. “It absolutely decreases the rate of cancer, and it might be a step in the right direction, but it’s not the entire solution.”</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-51e2f62f">Politics</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chief Justice John Roberts</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><ul><li><p>Chief Justice John Roberts deployed his authority during the last Supreme Court term to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/justice-roberts-trump-supreme-court.html" title="">mold rulings that benefited Donald Trump</a>, a Times investigation found.</p></li><li><p>False claims that Trump has repeated about migrant gangs in Aurora, Colo., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-aurora-colorado-immigration.html" title="">stem from the city’s fight with a landlord</a>.</p></li><li><p>“She was good at standing up for herself”: The Times reporter Astead Herndon spent the week after the presidential debate speaking with undecided voters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000009686262/what-we-learned-from-talking-to-undecided-voters.html" title="">Watch a video</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-1ea6046c">New York City</h2><ul><li><p>Federal investigations could endanger Mayor Eric Adams’s re-election chances — and his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/nyregion/eric-adams-scandal-crisis.html" title="">ability to enact his political agenda</a>.

In this otherworldly best seller from Matt Haig, author of “The Midnight Library,” a septuagenarian math teacher lands a shack in Ibiza, Spain, compliments of a long-lost friend. Of course there are strings attached — mysteries to solve, environmental crises to deflect and entanglements (quantum, romantic and otherwise) to unravel. But roiling beneath Mediterranean splendor is a deeper message about the unknown and whether it should remain that way.

But it’s also a literal body-horror film in which Moore’s character takes a strange elixir that allows her to create a younger, more perfect version of herself. Moore, now in her 60s, spoke about her own attempts at changing her body over the years, and aging in an industry that doesn’t always embrace older women.</em></p><p><strong>Why did you sign on to star in a movie about a woman who’s aging in Hollywood and at war with her own body? It felt very meta watching you do this. </strong></p><p>Why it was easy for me to step in and do this is because I don’t feel I am her. This is a woman who has no family — she’s dedicated her entire life to her career, and when that’s taken, what does she have? And so, in a way, I had enough separation from her, and at the same time, a deep, internal connection to the pain that she was experiencing, the rejection that she felt. I knew it would be challenging, but potentially a really important exploration of the issue.</p><p><strong>Tell me what you understand the issue to be. </strong></p><p>That it’s not about what’s being done to us — it’s what we do to ourselves.
