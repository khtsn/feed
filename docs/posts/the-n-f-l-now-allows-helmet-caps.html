    <h1>The N.F.L. Now Allows Helmet Caps</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata"><img alt="Gina Kolata" title="Gina Kolata" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-gina-kolata/author-gina-kolata-thumbLarge-v4.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p>Now that the N.F.L. season has begun, you may have noticed football players wearing a strange sort of cover over their helmets. It’s called a Guardian Cap, and it adds a layer of foam to the outside of the helmet, with the aim of reducing brain injuries.</p><p>N.F.L. players have worn the caps during summer practice for the past few years, but this is the first season the league is allowing them in games. A handful of players wore them during the opening weekend.</p><p>The company behind the caps, Guardian Sports, says they reduce the force of the impact when a player’s head is hit. But what does that mean? And do they protect against concussions?</p><p>Erin Hanson, Guardian’s founder and owner, said an N.F.L. study found that when players used Guardian helmet caps in practice, the number of concussions fell by more than 50 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yet, Guardian also has a disclaimer on its website: “No helmet, practice apparatus or helmet pad can prevent or eliminate the risk of concussions or other serious head injuries while playing sports. Researchers have not reached an agreement on how the results of impact absorption tests relate to concussions.”</p><p>In a telephone interview, Hanson emphasized that it was unrealistic to think that the cap would prevent all concussions.</p><p>“Football is a dangerous collision sport,” she said. “No doubt about it.”</p><p>I asked brain trauma experts to weigh in. What sort of protection can players realistically expect if they wear the helmet caps? Today’s newsletter explains what the extra padding could do for concussions, and for C.T.E., the long-term condition that plagues many players later in life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tua Tagovailoa of the Miami Dolphins, center, suffered a concussion during a game on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lynne Sladky/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1ebb6be1">The trouble with concussions</h2><p>Don’t count on these new helmet caps to protect against concussions, experts said.</p><p>“The problem is that people confuse head injuries with brain injuries,” Dr. Jamshid Ghajar, a neurosurgeon and the president of the Brain Trauma Foundation, told me. “Helmets definitely help with head injuries,” like a fractured skull or injuries to the scalp, he noted, but they don’t help with concussions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Concussions arise when a person’s neck bends and twists after the head is hit. That was apparent on Thursday, when the Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a concussion from a tackle that caused his neck to turn sharply.</p><p>“The neck is very flexible,” Dr. Ghajar said. “Its movement causes the brain injury problem, making the front part of the brain whiplash.” The front of the brain, he added, “is where we see concussions and severe brain injury.”</p><p>Race-car drivers wear helmets that actually protect them from concussions, Dr. Ghajar noted. The helmet holds the neck rigid so it cannot move in a collision. “Drivers have had collisions at over 200 miles per hour and no brain injury,” he said.</p><p>“Helmets and padding work if you have an iron neck,” Dr. Ghajar added.</p><h2 id="link-2bb3a9dc">Tricky data</h2><p>But what about that N.F.L. study of players that Hanson cited, showing a 50 percent reduction?</p><p>“That was a pleasant surprise,” Dr. Javier Cardenas, a senior medical adviser for the N.F.L., told me. It happened two years in a row, he added, which led him to conclude that the caps “definitely” reduced the risk of concussions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, a concussion expert at Massachusetts General Hospital, is not convinced. He noted that the N.F.L.’s study had relied on players reporting their own symptoms, which makes it hard to draw conclusions.</p><p>The problem, Dr. Daneshvar said, is that players may not always recognize symptoms of a concussion, or may ignore them. And if they think their new helmet caps are protecting them, they may be less likely to report a concussion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Carchietta/USA TODAY Sports, via Reuters Con</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-4f64f84f">Hope for C.T.E.</h2><p>C.T.E., or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is the condition that most frightens many football players. It can lead to memory loss and behavioral changes years later. And it results from not just the traumatic impacts that cause concussions, but also the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/sports/football/cte-study-concussions-brain-tackle.html" title="">accumulation of smaller hits to the head</a> that every football player endures.</p><p>The extra padding of helmet caps could, in theory, help reduce that. “Anything that decreases force to the head will decrease the risk of C.T.E.,” Dr. Daneshvar said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Kylen Granson, a tight end for the Indianapolis Colts, has said he plans to wear a helmet cap all season. “I would be remiss in not taking every precaution that’s available to me,” Granson said in a recent Instagram video. “I’m going to get married this coming year. I want to be able to remember our first dance 30 years from now.”</p><p>The N.F.L. has cited a lab study that found Guardian caps reduced force by 10 percent. That “would probably decrease C.T.E. risk,” Dr. Daneshvar said, though he cautioned that the lab study used dummies with rigid necks, which he said created “ideal circumstances to maximize the effect.”</p><p>“My analogy would be a filtered cigarette,” Dr. Daneshvar said. “It absolutely decreases the rate of cancer, and it might be a step in the right direction, but it’s not the entire solution.”</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-51e2f62f">Politics</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chief Justice John Roberts</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Kharkiv, Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><ul><li><p>Despite bombing, residents of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv find opportunities for joy in art, dancing and family. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/europe/kharkiv-ukraine-russia-photos.html" title="">See images</a>.</p></li><li><p>Iraq has quietly allowed the Iranian-backed groups Hamas and the Houthis to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/middleeast/iran-iraq-hamas-houthis.html" title="">open offices in Baghdad</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/middleeast/houthis-israel-yemen.html" title="">The Houthis launched a missile at Israel</a>, penetrating the center of the country for the second time in two months.

In this otherworldly best seller from Matt Haig, author of “The Midnight Library,” a septuagenarian math teacher lands a shack in Ibiza, Spain, compliments of a long-lost friend. Of course there are strings attached — mysteries to solve, environmental crises to deflect and entanglements (quantum, romantic and otherwise) to unravel. But roiling beneath Mediterranean splendor is a deeper message about the unknown and whether it should remain that way. Not to be confused with Steve Gleason’s moving memoir by the same name, “The Life Impossible” pairs well with Liane Moriarty’s “Here One Moment,” coming out on Tuesday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/books/review/the-life-impossible-matt-haig.html" title="">Read our review here.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Devin Oktar Yalkin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lulu-garcia-navarro"><img alt="Lulu Garcia-Navarro" title="Lulu Garcia-Navarro" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/29/reader-center/author-lulu-navarro-garcia/author-lulu-navarro-garcia-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p><em>This week’s subject for The Interview is Demi Moore, whose new movie, “The Substance,” is a dark comedy about the horrors of getting older as a woman in Hollywood. But it’s also a literal body-horror film in which Moore’s character takes a strange elixir that allows her to create a younger, more perfect version of herself. Moore, now in her 60s, spoke about her own attempts at changing her body over the years, and aging in an industry that doesn’t always embrace older women.</em></p><p><strong>Why did you sign on to star in a movie about a woman who’s aging in Hollywood and at war with her own body? It felt very meta watching you do this. </strong></p><p>Why it was easy for me to step in and do this is because I don’t feel I am her. This is a woman who has no family — she’s dedicated her entire life to her career, and when that’s taken, what does she have? And so, in a way, I had enough separation from her, and at the same time, a deep, internal connection to the pain that she was experiencing, the rejection that she felt. I knew it would be challenging, but potentially a really important exploration of the issue.</p><p><strong>Tell me what you understand the issue to be. </strong></p><p>That it’s not about what’s being done to us — it’s what we do to ourselves. It’s the violence we have against ourselves.</p><p><strong>The movie starts with your character sitting down with a male executive and being told that when you turn 50, it’s over.

It’s less overt and a little bit more of the unspoken perception that your desirability — there’s a line in the film that says your desirability as a woman is done with your fertility, which for me, it’s a perception that’s been bought into, but it doesn’t make it the truth.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/magazine/demi-moore-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>. </em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photograph of Prince in 1979 by Jurgen Reisch.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Testani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><p>Tortellini is an amazing all-ages convenience food, Emily Weinstein writes in this week’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/dining/tortellini-to-the-rescue.html" title="">Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter</a>.
