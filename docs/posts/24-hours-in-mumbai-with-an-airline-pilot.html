Here’s how a visit last spring unfolded.</p><h2 id="link-368348e8">First stop: Hotel</h2><p>We touched down in a light headwind on Runway 27 at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport at 8:30 a.m., but it was 10:15 by the time my colleagues and I reached our hotel north of Mumbai’s traffic-clogged historic core. In every city I follow my 10 a.m. rule: If I reach my hotel before then, I’ll sleep for three hours (we get early check-in). If I arrive after, I’ll stay up until a reasonable bedtime. So, no nap for me.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>My other rule — pilots love rules — is to try to banish jet lag with a swim. After 1,500 meters of freestyle in my hotel’s nearly deserted pool and an instant coffee in my room, I headed down to the lobby.</p><h2 id="link-2ec3ed02">Second stop: The Byculla neighborhood</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The botanical garden is a popular destination for Mumbaikars, as local residents are known. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Poras Chaudhary for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Raja, a Mumbaikar friend, first recommended the <a href="https://www.bdlmuseum.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum</a> to me years ago — it’s Mumbai’s oldest museum — but I’d never been, so I fired up the Uber app to book a taxi. (Autorickshaws, India’s ubiquitous three-wheeled vehicles, while cheaper than taxis and easily booked on ride apps, aren’t permitted in Mumbai’s core districts.)</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A couple taking pictures at the botanical garden, which is in the heart of the Byculla neighborhood.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Poras Chaudhary for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A family pauses for a drink from a pyaav, or traditional water fountain.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Poras Chaudhary for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The 16-mile ride to the Byculla neighborhood took 50 minutes in Mumbai’s traffic. Arriving just after midday, I found the museum’s main building, a Palladian masterpiece, closed for renovation, so I detoured to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/themumbaizoo/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">botanical gardens</a> and zoo next door. Entering through a grand triple archway, I strolled past several restored <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-40847731" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pyaavs</a>, the city’s traditional public drinking fountains, and paused in the welcome shade of lush trees whose names — <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/majestic-trees-the-story-of-a-ghost-who-does-not-walk-nature-conservation-foundation/fgXxFVa6qCKaKw?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ghost</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminalia_arjuna" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arjun</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagerstroemia_speciosa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pride of India</a> — reminded me how far I’d flown. Mumbai’s oldest public garden was festive and crowded — I spotted no other obvious foreigners, and twice I was asked to join a Mumbaikar family’s photos.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-2980aed5">Third stop: Lunch</h2><p>By then it’d been seven hours since my breakfast in the cockpit, as dawn broke over the coast of Oman. So instead of a bite at one of my favorite Mumbai cafes (the <a href="https://kgcafe.in/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kala Ghoda Café</a> or the vegetarian <a href="https://www.cntraveller.in/story/kala-ghoda-6-reasons-to-visit-cafe-knead-in-mumbai-chef-moshe-sheks-comeback-venture/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Café Knead</a>), I decided on a proper lunch at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/britannia_co/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Britannia &amp; Co.</a>, a cash-only Parsi restaurant in the <a href="https://ramaarya.blog/2016/11/09/mumbai-ballard-estate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ballard Estate</a>, a portside business district developed in the early decades of the 20th century.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The 101-year-old Britannia &amp; Co. restaurant has a shabby-colonial vibe.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Poras Chaudhary for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>This 101-year-old restaurant’s shabby-colonial vibe — ornamental metalwork in the arched entrances, a pendulum clock, dust-blotched chandeliers and swirling ceiling fans — is eminently Instagrammable, but it’s the warm service and tasty food that draw me back. When I sat down around 2 p.m., my bow-tied waiter recommended the <a href="https://www.cntraveller.in/story/from-iran-to-india-the-story-of-mumbais-iconic-berry-pulao/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paneer Berry Pulav</a> (white and saffron rice with cheese, topped with cashews and barberries; 500 rupees, or about $6) and — eyeing my soaked brow — a bottle of Pallonji’s neon-yellow ginger soda. Founded in 1865, Pallonji has long been associated with Mumbai’s Zoroastrian community, which played an important role in the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51942067" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">popularization</a> of carbonated drinks throughout India (some merchants even adopted surnames such as “Sodawaterwala”).</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The interior of Britannia &amp; Co., which has dust-blotched chandeliers, swirling ceiling fans and numerous historical photos on the walls.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Poras Chaudhary for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A pilot’s lunch: Paneer Berry Pulav (white and saffron rice with cheese, topped with cashews and barberries) and a bottle of Pallonji’s neon-yellow ginger soda.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Poras Chaudhary for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>As I ate, I did a bit of preparation for the next morning’s flight home to London. I looked at an app that provides aviation-tuned weather forecasts: hot and dry here, gray and breezy back home.

The station was designated a <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/945/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> in 2004. To access its hidden treasures — including the balcony that offers a close-up view of the booking office’s star-spangled ceiling and the station’s deserted terraces, which look out over the ceaseless bustle of Dr. Dadabhai Naoroji Road — I recommend <a href="https://in.bookmyshow.com/activities/the-crown-jewel-of-mumbai-inside-csmt-tour/ET00361621" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Raconteur Tours</a>’ 90-minute guided exploration.</p><p>A staff member helped me purchase my train ticket, and a businessman showed me where to stand on the platform. I was grateful for their assistance, because Mumbai’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031gw92" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commuter trains</a> are not for the fainthearted. Well before the inbound train stopped, arriving passengers were jumping off and departing ones were jumping on. When the train was finally stationary, I joined the rush to board, snagging a window seat that faced backward, south toward the city center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mumbai’s commuter trains are not for the fainthearted, with the doors often open and people hanging out over the rails, but a ride on one offers a glimpse of everyday life.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Poras Chaudhary for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>My train wasn’t air-conditioned. Indeed, my window had no glass, and the carriage entrances had no doors. One commuter was seated cross-legged on the floor in the entryway, reading a book, his knees out over the tracks as the train pulled out. Above him a young guy wearing a skinny necktie and headphones was hanging halfway out of the carriage, squinting in the slipstream as he typed on his smartphone with his free hand.</p><p>I’ve long been fond of the term <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/travel/skyfaring-book-airline-pilot-mark-vanhoenacker.html" title="">“place lag,”</a> which captures the bewilderment induced by the speed and planetary scale of the journeys enabled by airliners. Surges of place lag are inevitable, even for pilots, so I’ve learned to embrace them. Yesterday I was in London; today I’m in Mumbai. It’s an ordinary Thursday evening, not long before the monsoon; I’m seated on this rumbling train, looking into the blur of the receding city.</p><p>When I reached my hotel, I joined my colleagues for dinner. After that I returned to my room, ironed a shirt for the morning’s flight and then, at last, I slept.</p><p><a href="http://markvanhoenacker.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Mark Vanhoenacker</em></a> <em>is an airline pilot and the author of </em><a href="http://markvanhoenacker.com/skyfaring/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>“Skyfaring”</em></a><em> and </em><a href="http://markvanhoenacker.com/imagine-a-city" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>“Imagine a City.”</em></a></p><hr/></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Open Up Your World</h2><h3>Considering a trip, or just some armchair traveling?
