During a recent dinner service, it averaged about eight inches in height, but this salad skyscraper has been known to reach up to a foot.</p><p>“It’s bizarre to say because it’s this giant, beautiful salad,” said Andrew DiTomo, the chef and a partner at the restaurant, “but the way it came to be, why it’s big, and why we use full leaves is all about function.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. DiTomo said he created the salad with the intention that it would accompany the whole meal: Servers encourage diners to heap the leaves next to their hot roast beef sandwiches or pile them on fried turkey cutlets — “almost like salad nachos,” he said. It’s one thing to scoop crab dip with a romaine trowel at a come-as-you-are tavern, but what about on a date at a trendy bistro?</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Three anchovies sit on a Parmesan cracker on top of romaine leaves." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq/06FD-TOO-BIG-SALADS3-vhmq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/18e44173-639d-50ac-9e67-7a13fa448ec7" decoding="async" width="600" height="600"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Caesar salad at Salum in Dallas is served as it was when it was invented in Tijuana, Mexico, with whole leaves of romaine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonathan Zizzo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Lately, restaurants across the country are opting for the dramatic appearance, textural integrity and dressing adhesion of whole-leaf salads, despite the inelegance of disassembling and actually eating them.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.barparisette.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bar Parisette</a> in Chicago, ruffly, whole red lettuce leaves are tossed in Champagne vinaigrette, then showered with herbs and breadcrumbs. In Dallas, the New American restaurant <a href="https://www.salumrestaurant.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Salum</a> keeps tender butter lettuce petals intact in a spring salad with Texas citrus vinaigrette. The menu at <a href="https://www.haywardrestaurant.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hayward</a> in McMinnville, Ore., recently featured whole endive leaves and radish slices tossed in caper vinaigrette with shaved Gouda. Like most of the whole-leaf salads mentioned here, this one arrived with a steak knife.</p><p>“I think it should be socially acceptable to eat this type of salad with your hands,” said Allison Scott, the test kitchen director for the chef and restaurateur Rick Bayless. “I just hate eating a salad that’s inevitably going to foolishly poke out of the sides of my mouth or take forever to dismantle with a fork and knife.”</p><p>Kari Shaughnessy, the chef and owner of Hayward, thinks that the trend has to do with the visual appeal of whole-leaf salads. “It’s harder to make a salad that’s all chopped up look pretty,” she said. Opting for whole leaves is also practical: Delicate chicories and crisp, juicy gem lettuces wilt if precut at 4 p.m., when her restaurant preps for dinner service. Big leaves also cradle breadcrumbs, seeds, herbs and cheese more effectively.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Our job is to make you the perfect bite,” Ms. Shaughnessy said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kari Shaughnessy, the chef and owner of Hayward in Oregon, insists that whole leaves salads are as practical as they are attractive.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Celeste Noche for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Whole-leaf salads have graced fancy restaurant tables for decades — the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/magazine/recipe-salad-bacon-lettuce-wedge-iceberg.html" title="">wedge</a> salad, an iceberg lettuce doorstop blanketed in blue cheese dressing and strewed with bacon and tomato bits being the most famous example. The original <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/dining/caesar-salad.html" title="">Caesar salad</a>, invented in Tijuana, Mexico, in 1924, also featured whole romaine hearts.</p><p>In 2016, Bon Appétit magazine blurred the utensil-hand line when it started pushing “hand salad” recipes to the <a href="https://www.today.com/food/what-hand-salad-bon-appetit-s-recipe-controversial-t109711" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ire of the internet</a>. Then came restaurants like <a href="https://www.cozyroyale.com/menu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cozy Royale</a> in Brooklyn, which serves deliciously messy gem wedges and hippie salads piled high with chunky romaine and fried chickpeas on hubcap-size plates.</p><p>Despite arguments from chefs and food writers that salad should double as a tortilla or “look as dreamy as if it fell from the sky,” the way Ms. Shaughnessy said she learned to make it at <a href="https://www.frances-sf.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frances</a> in San Francisco, some diners won’t budge. Marie Tran-McCaslin, a general surgeon in Fresno, Calif., never cared much for the wedge, nor does she think salad should ever come with a knife. She prefers a “properly dressed” chopped salad.</p><p>“Why am I cutting lettuce like a steak?” she said. “Although, yes, the leaves stay crunchy when left whole, that can be achieved with dressing on the side, too.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Abraham Salum, the Mexico City-born owner of Salum, takes particular pride in his keeping his <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025567-caesars-caesar-salad" title="">Caesar old school</a>, down to the whole blades of romaine, which are “better on the eyes with obviously more crunch, though you need a knife,” he said. However,<strong> </strong>breaking with tradition (and modernity), the kitchen will chop it for those who ask, including Mr. Salum’s husband. “On his diner profile, it says ‘please chop his Caesar.’”</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Investigating Shrimp Fraud:</strong> With a flood of imported seafood driving the U.S. shrimp industry to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/dining/shrimp-fraud-gulf-coast-new-orleans.html">the edge of ruin</a>, a consulting company out of Houston is testing truth in menu labeling.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Colorful Cult of Le Creuset</strong>: The weighty cookware, which just turned 100, has inspired generations of home chefs and fans who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/dining/le-creuset.html">feverishly hunt for their favorite</a> shapes and shades.</p></li><li><p><strong>Just Don’t Call It Tequila:</strong> California agave spirits, a recent addition to the liquor cabinet, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/dining/california-agave-spirits.html">aim for a bigger slice of the market</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restaurants With No Kitchen</strong>: Tight spaces with minimal equipment — often not even a stove — are loved by chefs who leverage the limitations to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/dining/restaurants-with-no-kitchen.html">turn out thrilling dishes</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Eating in New York City</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>A Restaurant Better Than Its Buzz</strong>: Under all the hype and beautiful-people veneer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/dining/bridges-restaurant-review.html">Bridges is full of surprises</a>, starting with an imaginative, globally inspired menu.</p></li><li><p><strong>New York’s Most Exciting New Restaurant:</strong> Ha’s Snack Bar plans to scale up in size and ambition, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/dining/has-snack-bar-review.html">it’s already turning heads</a> with its freewheeling takes on French and Vietnamese flavors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cozy New York Restaurants</strong>: Cafe Kestrel in Brooklyn and Cocina Consuelo in Harlem <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/dining/restaurant-review-cafe-kestrel-cocina-consuelo-nyc.html">can restore the spirit</a> with warm service, cheery surroundings and deeply satisfying food.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can An All-Day Cafe Be Exciting?</strong>: At Cafe Mado in Brooklyn, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/dining/cafe-mado-nyc-restaurant-review.html">the heart of an adventurous tasting-menu restaurant</a> beats within a relaxed comfort-food retreat.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
