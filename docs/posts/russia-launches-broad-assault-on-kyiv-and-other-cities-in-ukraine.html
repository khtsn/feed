The thuds of air defense batteries and the staccato bursts of heavy machine guns echoed through the night in the capital, as military units defending the city tried to take down missiles streaking overhead and attack drones that swooped in, their ominous buzz trailing over neighborhoods.</p><p>Over the course of some five hours after midnight, Russian launched 407 attack drones, nearly 40 cruise missiles and six ballistic missiles from land, air and sea at towns and cities across the breadth of the nation, the Ukrainian Air Force said in a <a href="https://t.me/kpszsu/35833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p><p>“Russia doesn’t change its stripes — another massive strike on cities and ordinary life,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/14511" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. “They targeted almost all of Ukraine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told President Trump that Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/world/europe/putin-zelensky-accusations-escalation.html" title="">would retaliate for Ukraine’s strikes on its bombers</a> last weekend, Mr. Trump said, further dimming hopes for a cease-fire that were already faint.</p><p>The Ukrainian attack, which involved smuggling drones deep into the Russian heartland and launching them from semi trucks, destroyed or damaged at least a dozen aircraft, including many of Moscow’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers. </p><p>“They attacked pretty harshly,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWRbK-Ewn90" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump said on Thursday</a> about the Ukrainian assault. “They went deep into Russia.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also compared Russia and Ukraine to two fighting children who needed to work out their differences before their bloody war could end.</p><p>“Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office as Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, urged him to leverage the power of the United States to end the conflict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump avoided answering a question about whether he was willing to increase pressure on Russia. The Kremlin has repeatedly resisted his calls for an unconditional cease-fire.</p><p>In Friday’s strike by Russia, Ukrainian fighter jets, antiaircraft missile troops, electronic warfare and unmanned systems units, and mobile fire groups took out 406 of the air attack vehicles, with strikes reported in 13 locations, according to the air force. These figures could not be independently verified.</p><p>Multiple fires were reported across Kyiv, including at a 16-story apartment block. Another fire near the city center covered an area of more than 5,000 square feet.</p><p>Of the four people who died in Kyiv, three were rescuers who had rushed to extinguish the fires, <a href="https://t.me/Klymenko_MVS/1466" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrainian authorities said</a>. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, also <a href="https://t.me/vitaliy_klitschko/4756" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that 22 people had been injured</a> in the capital, and that search-and-rescue operations were continuing in several locations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Parts of western Ukraine that have not come under frequent attack were also targeted.</p><p>The city of Ternopil, which is hundreds of miles from the front, came under heavy assault, local authorities said, with at least 10 people injured, including five emergency workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People in uniforms on a street." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ccb1a4d0-1e2e-5dec-820a-cd63fe90839c" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers collecting what they said were presumably parts from a drone near where a residential building was damaged in a Russian strike in Kyiv on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roman Pilipey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In Lutsk, in northwestern Ukraine, Russia struck a high-rise apartment building and other locations, injuring at least 15 people, local authorities said.</p><p>Combined with a renewed ground offensive in the east, Friday’s attack was part of an intensifying Russian campaign to bombard Ukrainian cities with swarms of drones and missiles, designed to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Russia has launched more than 1,000 drones per week at military and civilian targets in Ukraine in recent months, including nearly 500 in a single night last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firefighters at the site of a Russian drone attack in Kyiv on Friday.

The governor of the Russian Saratov region, Roman Busargin, said that overnight on Thursday, there was a large fire after an oil depot at the Engels air base came under attack by Ukrainian drones.</p><p>“There are no casualties as of yet,” he said.</p><p>A powerful explosion was reported by an airfield in the Bryansk region and the local governor, Alexander Bogomaz, said some 46 Ukrainian drones targeted the area.
