		<p>FNATIC has eliminated Sentinels from Masters Toronto in a close 2-1 win. Bringing EMEA into the top four, they have ensured that all four regions are represented in the final stage of the tournament.</p>

<p>The last time these teams faced was in Champions 2024, also fighting to break into the top four. Back then, it was Sentinels that managed to win out a close 2-1 series, but FNATIC have taken their revenge this time around.</p>

<p>Sentinels took the first map of Sunset 13-9. FNATIC bounced back to win Ascent 13-7, and Icebox 13-9 to take the series.</p>

<p>Sentinels will exit Masters Toronto with two champs points, while FNATIC moves on to the top four to face G2 Esports.</p>
