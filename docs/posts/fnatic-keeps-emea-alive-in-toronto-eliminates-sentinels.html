</span> from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a> in a close 2-1 win. Bringing EMEA into the top four, they have ensured that all four regions are represented in the final stage of the tournament.</p>

<p>The last time these teams <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378834/sentinels-vs-fnatic-valorant-champions-2024-lr2" target="_blank">faced</a> was in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024/playoffs" target="_blank">Champions 2024</a>, also fighting to break into the top four. Back then, it was Sentinels that managed to win out a close 2-1 series, but FNATIC took their revenge this time around.</p>

<p>“I&#39;m super happy to get revenge because they didn&#39;t deserve in champions to win against us, and we showed them why,” said <span data-ref-id="2">

</span> a day prior, Sentinels decided to run it back on their home turf. Going into the match, FNATIC had yet to win the map on the international stage, sitting on a 0-3 record. Given Sentinels&#39; comfort on the map, it should&#39;ve been a slam dunk of a map win for them, which it started out looking like just that. Winning both pistol rounds and both bonus rounds, Sentinels easily got up to an 11-4 lead.</p>

</span> showed just hours earlier, an 11-4 lead is no safe lead, and FNATIC started to forge a comeback. It took a ballsy spike stick from Alfajer to get the ball rolling, but once it did, Sentinels started to sweat. Five rounds in a row cut the lead down to two, and forced a timeout from Sentinels.</p>


<p><em>When Alfajer starts hitting shots like these, you might start sweating.</em></p>

<p>On the next round, however, <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36245/n4rrate">
		N4RRATE	</a>
</span> pulled off what was essentially a 1v5, finally getting Sentinels up to match point. After that, FNATIC&#39;s momentum was gone, and Sentinels won the map 13-9.</p>


<p><em>N4RRATE saves the map for Sentinels.</em></p>

<p>Moving to map two of Ascent, both teams showed up with some unique agent picks. Sentinels pulled out <span data-ref-id="7">

</span>, who had been popping off all tournament, was shut down in first engagements, giving FNATIC the advantage in many rounds. They quickly converted a 13-7 win on the map.</p>


<p><em>Alfajer&#39;s bringing back the 2022 Chamber meta.</em></p>

<p>Bringing it to the final map of Icebox, FNATIC showed up with an agent composition straight out of 2021. For the first time this year, <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span> was on Jett, while Chronicle took up the role of Sage. While both performed well, the star of the show was Alfajer, undoubtedly the MVP of the series. Utilizing the attack side Operator on Killjoy, he ripped through Sentinels&#39; defense, holding them to only two rounds in the second half, letting FNATIC take the win on Icebox 13-9.</p>


<p><em>A full dose of all of FNATIC in one round.</em></p>

<p>Eliminated in the top six, Sentinels will leave Toronto with two championship points, bringing them to a total of 11. With their consistent performance throughout the year, they sit at second place in Americas, giving them a solid chance to qualify to Champions.</p>

<p>Reaching the top four, FNATIC have made their furthest tournament run since winning <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo" target="_blank">Masters Tokyo</a> two years ago. If they want to return to their tournament winning glory, they&#39;ll have to first get past G2 in another Champions 2024 <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378832/g2-esports-vs-fnatic-valorant-champions-2024-lr1" target="_blank">rematch</a>.</p>
