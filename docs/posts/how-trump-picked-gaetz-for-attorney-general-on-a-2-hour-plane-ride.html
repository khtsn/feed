    <h1>How Trump Picked Gaetz for Attorney General on a 2-Hour Plane Ride</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Gaetz’s name first came up on the flight up to Washington. It came up again on the flight home, after Mr. Trump found all of his various options — including a state attorney general from Missouri and two top corporate lawyers — to be lacking, according to two people briefed on the matter.</p><p>Mr. Gaetz has been one of Mr. Trump’s most aggressive defenders in public, and worked with Ms. Wiles to help prepare him for the debate with President Biden that knocked Mr. Biden out of the race four weeks later.</p><p>People with knowledge of the decision said Mr. Trump appeared to have gained some clarity on what he wanted while he was in Washington, the city he left in 2020 after weeks of his election lies, and where a special counsel was appointed by the Justice Department and ultimately indicted him three times.</p><p>The statement on Mr. Gaetz was issued from Mr. Trump’s plane — sent not from the Trump transition team by email, as has been the case for all other appointments, but on his own social media platform, Truth Social.</p></div></div>
