<p>The first series of the day promised no shortage of intrigue, as it pitted a reformed Global Esports team against VARREL, who carried the core of the team that placed first at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2535/vct-2025-pacific-ascension/playoffs" target="_blank">Pacific Ascension</a> as <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> without dropping a single map. Entering the arena on Friday, the question surrounding VARREL was whether or not the team&#39;s eye-catching playstyle would translate to the VCT level.</p>

<p>VARREL claimed the opening pistol round of the series, but faltered soon after. The team gave up not just a thrifty, but let Global snowball four straight rounds to claim an early lead. Global wrapped up its attack side up 8-4, and after winning the opening pistol of its defense half, the multi-national squad proved to be too much.</p>

<p>While the VARREL players still showed off their technical ability and flashes of heroics, Global seemed to have a significant advantage on the macro, gripping much better control of the map as a team.</p>

<p>On Global&#39;s map pick of Abyss, that trend continued as the team&#39;s new roles seemed to be more defined. Former <span data-ref-id="6">

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/34926/oonzmlp">

</span> on Harbor. In addition, both teams had Veto, Sova, and Yoru.</p>

<p>To open the map, Global carried over its momentum from Split. Starting on defense, the team won the first five rounds of the series, but a timeout from coaching pair <span data-ref-id="12">

At times, it looked as though the VARREL players were disconnected, forced to take on disadvantageous duels while Global moved as one team. UdoTan had a match-high 42 kills in the series, while in-game leader xavi8k tallied on an additional 40.</p>

<p>The series opened on Gen.G&#39;s pick of Abyss. Both teams opted for mirror comps, with the Waylay-Yoru pairing complemented by Astra, Sova, and Veto. DFM, starting on defense, had its foot on the gas. Proactive play saw the team take space across all three fronts on the map, welcoming pressure even if it meant sacrificing presence elsewhere.</p>

<p>The early cat-and-mouse game was won by DFM, who claimed an early 4-1 lead. The deficit forced an early timeout from head coach <span data-ref-id="24">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4562/solo">
		solo	</a>
</span>. DFM kept Gen.G at arm&#39;s length, proving to be able not just to go blow for blow with the Tigers, but also play its own macro game proficiently. The Japanese side&#39;s early aggression put Gen.G on the back foot, often requiring some heroics from the likes of Karon. By halftime, DFM held a 7-5 lead.</p>

<p>Gen.G looked poised to start the second half on the right foot with a pistol round win, but a well-executed anti-eco helped DFM parlay some momentum into an 11-6 lead. While Gen.G looked like a shell of its former self on Abyss, DFM was flying. Despite a quieter performance from <span data-ref-id="25">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6672/meiy">
		Meiy	</a>
</span>, who has been prone to having breakout performances on Abyss, DFM prevailed. The star Duelist had just 11 kills on the map, while Caedye had a map-high 24 kills to lead the way.</p>

<p>DFM&#39;s map pick of Pearl opened similarly to how Abyss did. The map is one that should bring fond memories for DFM. At last year&#39;s Kickoff, the Japanese squad <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/vct-2025-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">upset Paper Rex</a> 2-0 in the lower bracket to eliminate the giants from the event. This year, DFM looked to clinch a signature upset once again.</p>

<p>Starting on attack, DFM seized yet another early lead, going up 4-1 again. Gen.G again punched back to make things close, easing to a 5-4 deficit while the likes of <span data-ref-id="26">

</span> started heating up. Despite Meiy getting off to a hotter start, Gen.G entered halftime with a 7-5 lead, winning the final four rounds of the half in the process.</p>

<p>Once again, Gen.G struggled to start the half, being held at a 9-9 standstill with DFM by the time its last timeout was called. Despite the timeout, Gen.G had trouble working through its struggles. While its defense on Pearl was solid, Gen.G looked disorganized on attack, oftentimes looking lost and not on the same page. While Gen.G looked to claw back, struggles to open halves ultimately doomed the team to a 13-10 loss on the map and a 2-0 loss in the series. </p>


<p><em>DFM ends Pearl the way it played most of its defender half: Clean, coordinated, and sharp.</em></p>

<p>Meiy&#39;s impressive Pearl helped him top the kills leaderboard with 42 in the series, but rookie player Caedye was perhaps the most impressive player, logging a team-high 1.20 rating while Ash&#39;s 1.22 was not enough in the losing effort.</p>
