The inspectors general were from the Defense and State departments, as well as from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was the government’s main conduit for distributing foreign aid before the Trump administration largely dismantled it earlier this year.</p><p>The United States policy has been that repatriating residents of camps like al-Hol and its smaller neighbor, Roj, is the only way to keep ISIS from regaining strength in the Middle East. The presence of militants in the camps and the poor living conditions have made them fertile recruiting grounds. U.S. officials have also said repatriations are a necessary step toward relieving the United States of financial responsibility for the camps.</p><p>But major reductions in American aid have hobbled that effort, the report said. No Syrians left al-Hol to return to their homes in the first three months of the year because “key project activities identifying, preparing, and receiving Syrian returnees were halted,” according to the inspectors general report.</p><p>In addition, the report said pauses in security funding at al-Hol and Roj had led to periods of looting and protests, and a rise in attempts to smuggle people in and out of the camps. By the end of March, al-Hol housed about 36,000 people, most of them children, while Roj camp had another 2,400. They are not allowed to leave without permission.</p><p>During the first quarter, about 1,500 families were transported from al-Hol and Roj to a camp just over the border in Iraq called Jeddah 1, which functions as a rehabilitation center for Iraqi returnees and is heavily financed by the United States, the report said. The Trump administration made an exception to the general freeze of foreign aid to provide money to the camp for clean water, health services and waste management.</p><p>Still, by the end of the quarter, the Jeddah 1 center “faced significant challenges in sustaining comprehensive humanitarian support” because of the termination of U.S.-backed programs to help educate, employ, and integrate returnees into their home communities, the report said.</p><p>There were also shortfalls at Jeddah 1 in services for women and girls who had experienced violence, the inspectors general wrote. An uptick in begging was observed, caused by, among other things, the suspension of cash-for-work programs and delays in the delivery of food rations, the report said.</p><p>In addition, the termination of U.S. support for the World Health Organization has compromised efforts to ensure returnees sent to Jeddah 1 could get medicine, mental health services, and treatment for chronic conditions, the report said — all of which had previously been considered important to helping people who had been affiliated with or under the influence of ISIS to return to normal life.</p><p>The White House, the Pentagon and the State Department did not immediately respond to a requests for comment about the report.</p><p>All told, Syria lost eight U.S.A.I.D. stabilization awards in the first quarter of the year, bringing its U.S.-backed portfolio of foreign aid projects down to just three. Iraq saw 20 U.S.A.I.D. stabilization awards cut, leaving it with just two.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2UwNDYwNTY1LTE1YmQtNTMyZS05NjllLWNhMTk1NDhiYzgxNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#may-day-trump-protests" data-source-id="100000010141746"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-01T21:12:07.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 1, 2025, 5:12 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="cardDeck"><section aria-label="Gallery" data-testid="Gallery"><div><ol><li><figure><div><svg width="100%" height="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"></svg></div><p><span>Chicago</span></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Jamie Kelter Davis</span></li><li><figure><p><span>New York</span></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Victor J.

But demonstrators said they were also angry about the “threat to democracy” posed by President Trump.</p><p>“I think the two coexist,” Ms. Olsen said, “and this huge turnout shows that.”</p><p>A separate effort, which organizers billed as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/nyregion/national-law-day-courthouse-protests.html" title="">National Law Day of Action</a>, brought legal professionals to the Supreme Court in Washington and federal courthouses across the country on Thursday to push for judicial independence and oppose efforts to intimidate law firms.</p><p>The lawyers demonstrating at the Supreme Court reaffirmed their oaths to serve with integrity and to protect the rule of law — principles that do not appear to interest Mr. Trump, said Fabiola Gretzinger, 28. “He thinks he’s above it,” she said.</p><p>Police closed streets for the crowds in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington. But protesters also rallied in small communities that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, including places like Norman, Okla., Sauk City, Wis., and Hendersonville, N.C. Groups held signs in front of municipal buildings and public schools, and some demonstrators wore red to indicate support for public education.</p><p>A rally in downtown Los Angeles began early on Thursday and focused largely on migrant rights. Jose Servín, 31, an organizer for a statewide coalition of advocacy groups who helped set up for the rally, held a sign that read, “Come for one of us, come for all of us.”</p><p>Mr. Servin immigrated to the United States as a child, he said. “I found a place here where I can succeed, where I can thrive, where I can plant roots — I’m a father now — and I’m going to fight like hell to protect that,” he said.</p><p>The protests — more than 1,000 were expected across the country — were spearheaded to coincide with traditional May Day labor rallies by <a href="https://www.fiftyfifty.one/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50501</a>, a loose coalition of grass-roots activist groups, as well as by labor, nonprofit and civil rights organizations. May Day commemorates the struggle for an eight-hour workday, won by labor organizers in 1886 only after clashes in Chicago resulted in the deadly Haymarket Riot.</p><p>Labor groups made up a significant portion of demonstrators at the rally in Chicago on Thursday, though pro-Palestinian activists and anti-Trump demonstrators swelled their ranks, and many saw their concerns as overlapping.</p><p>“He’s tearing apart our Constitution,” said Bill Hincks, 40, a union official from the Chicago suburb of Oak Forest, who faulted Mr. Trump for firing officials at agencies that regulate workplace safety, including at the National Labor Relations Board.</p><p>The Trump administration has sought to quell dissent in corporate America, universities, government agencies and the news media. But in recent weeks, demonstrations opposing the president’s agenda, as well as resistance from some of the institutions targeted by Mr. Trump, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-democrats-protests-law-firms-colleges.html" title="">increased in size and frequency</a>.</p><p>Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat who first ran for office in 2018 because of his revulsion to Mr. Trump’s first term, called for an even larger outcry during a speech on Sunday in New Hampshire.</p><p>“It’s time to fight everywhere, and all at once,” he said.</p><p>Katie Benner<!-- --> contributed from Washington.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDYzODNlNGItZTEwYy01NGU2LTg4ZGEtNTE1ZTFiYzJhOTE2"><div id="d6383e4b-e10c-54e6-88da-515e1bc2a916" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#d6383e4b-e10c-54e6-88da-515e1bc2a916"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tony-romm"><img alt="Tony Romm" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/17/reader-center/author-tony-romm/author-tony-romm-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/17/reader-center/author-tony-romm/author-tony-romm-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/17/reader-center/author-tony-romm/author-tony-romm-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-01T19:55:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 1, 2025, 3:55 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The White House is expected to release details of its budget for the 2026 fiscal year on Friday, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget confirmed.

Josh Green of Hawaii said his state intended to sue fossil fuel companies over their role in climate change to make them pay for damage from its effects, like the 2023 wildfires that devastated Maui.</p><p>“I guess this might be breaking news,” he said during an <a href="https://www.khon2.com/local-news/hawaii-to-file-lawsuit-against-fossil-fuel-companies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview on local television</a>. “We will be filing suit.”</p><div><p>On Wednesday, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70017206/1/united-states-v-state-of-hawaii/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued Hawaii first</a>, seeking to block the lawsuit before it could even be filed.</p><p>The Justice Department also filed a nearly identical suit <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70022745/united-states-v-state-of-michigan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">against Michigan</a>, where Attorney General Dana Nessel has retained three private law firms to pursue climate change litigation but has not yet sued. The main thrust of the administration’s argument is that the federal government should determine national energy policy, not individual states.</p><p>Legal experts said it was highly unusual to sue to block other lawsuits that have yet to be filed.</p><p>Nine Democratic-led states have already sued fossil fuel companies over climate change, along with dozens of municipalities around the country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/climate/maui-fires-lawsuit.html" title="">including Honolulu and Maui</a>. The oil industry and its allies have tried to get those cases thrown out by making similar arguments to the ones put forth in the Justice Department filings this week.</p><p>The lawsuits filed this week in Hawaii and Michigan cite President Trump’s April 8 executive order, “Protecting American Energy From State Overreach,” which argued that state policies inhibiting the energy industry weaken national security and drive up costs for Americans. It also said that the other lawsuits already filed by states over climate change could result in “crippling” damages to oil companies being sued.</p><p>Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said it was “at least highly unusual” to try to preemptively block lawsuits. “The usual procedure would be to move to intervene in existing lawsuits,” he said. “I’ve never heard of a situation where a lawsuit is filed to seek an injunction against somebody else filing a lawsuit.”</p><p>He predicted that such a legal strategy would not fare well. “Procedurally, it’s wacky,” he said.</p><p>Both suits, filed in federal courts in Hawaii and Michigan, named the state, its governor and attorney general. The offices of Mr. Green and the Hawaii attorney general, Anne Lopez, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Ms. Nessel called the lawsuit “at best frivolous and arguably sanctionable.” She said Mr. Trump had “made clear he will answer any and every beck and call from his Big Oil campaign donors” and called the lawsuits “perhaps the most surprising debasement of both the White House and D.O.J. yet.”</p><p>The legal and political battles have been escalating rapidly around the roughly three dozen cases brought by state and local governments against energy companies.</p><p>In January, the Supreme Court denied <a href="https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/case-documents/2024/20240228_docket-23-947_petition-for-writ-of-certiorari-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a request by the defendants in Honolulu</a>, including Sunoco, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, to review a Hawaii Supreme Court decision allowing the case to proceed. In March, the justices declined to review <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/158orig_jiek.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an action brought by Republican-governed states</a> against Democratic states that had sued oil companies.</p><p>Those efforts could have knocked down the entire batch of cases, which supporters call “climate deception” cases, because many center on the argument that oil companies concealed their knowledge about climate risks. Their detractors argue that they are an unlawful attempt to dictate energy policy at the expense of consumers.</p><p>Separately on Thursday, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1398816/dl?inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued New York</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1398811/dl?inline=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vermont</a> in federal courts in those states over new “climate superfund” laws that seek to recoup costs for damage from storms and floods.</p><p>In a news release, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said, “These burdensome and ideologically motivated laws and lawsuits threaten American energy independence and our country’s economic and national security.”</p><p>The New York law put the amount sought at $75 billion. The Vermont law set out a lengthy process to determine the amounts it would pursue.</p><p>In its lawsuits against New York and Vermont, the Justice Department is seeking a declaration that the two states’ laws are unconstitutional and to block their enforcement. The two measures were already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/nyregion/climate-change-superfund-act-lawsuit.html" title="">facing legal challenges from Republican-led states</a> and industry groups.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNmY3NGE4MWQtZGMyNS01NDNkLTliYTYtYzUyZDMwZTZjZTFk"><div id="6f74a81d-dc25-543d-9ba6-c52d30e6ce1d" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#6f74a81d-dc25-543d-9ba6-c52d30e6ce1d"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague"><img alt="Zach Montague" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-01T19:23:24.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 1, 2025, 3:23 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Representative Don Beyer of Virginia and at least a dozen Georgetown students attended a hearing today where lawyers for Badar Suri asked a federal judge to move his case back to Virginia.

In a note to C.I.A. officers last month, Mr. Ratcliffe said China was atop the agency’s priority list.</p><p>“No adversary in the history of our nation has presented a more formidable challenge or a more capable strategic competitor than the Chinese Communist Party,” Mr. Ratcliffe wrote. “It is intent on dominating the world economically, militarily and technologically, and it is aggressively trying to outcompete America in every corner of the globe.”</p><p>Mr. Ratcliffe has also told members of Congress that the C.I.A. needs to rebuild its human intelligence collection efforts: case officers recruiting Chinese officials to steal secrets from the Chinese government.</p><p>Last year the C.I.A. released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFJ9HVIVjIk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">instructions in Mandarin</a> about how people in China could safely use the dark web to contact the agency. The text-only instructional video was viewed 900,000 times. While the Chinese internet is locked down and censored, American officials believe that more sophisticated Chinese officials know how to work around those controls.</p><p>A U.S. official said the agency would not have made the most recent, highly produced, videos if the instructional video had not worked.</p><p>In a statement Thursday, Mr. Ratcliffe said the new videos were aimed at “recruiting Chinese officials to steal secrets.” “Our agency must continue responding to this threat with urgency, creativity, and grit, and these videos are just one of the ways we are doing this,” Mr. Ratcliffe said.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utgx6uOO4KQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One of the new videos released Thursday</a> shows a midlevel official struggling in his daily life as he attends to a more senior official, who is living a comfortable life of fancy meals, clothes and cars. “The party raised us to believe that our dedication to the path they lead us on would bring prosperity to us all,” the midlevel official narrates. “But the gains of our collective efforts are indulged by a select few. So, I must forge my own path.”</p><p>The final scene shows the midlevel official using a mobile phone to securely contact the C.I.A.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU2T8RKAzDg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The other video</a> plays on fears that the Chinese government is arresting and ousting senior officials without explanation.</p><p>“I see my position rise within the party as those above me are cast aside,” the video’s narration says. “But now I realize that my fate is just as precarious.”</p><p>The video shows the senior official avoiding Chinese government agents closing in on him. As he fears for his career, the senior official says he must find ways to protect his family. The video closes again with images of the official contacting the C.I.A.</p><p>“My purpose remains the same,” the video concludes. “Only my path has changed. No matter what my fate may bring, my family will know a good life.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNmNDc5ZjE0LTU2Y2UtNTNhZS1hNGNiLTczMTRiYjVlMzIwNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#texas-judge-trump-alien-enemies-act" data-source-id="100000010140801"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-01T17:47:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 1, 2025, 1:47 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A flight carrying migrants deported from the United States arriving in Venezuela in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Loureiro Fernandez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A federal judge on Thursday permanently barred the Trump administration from invoking the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law, to deport Venezuelans it has deemed to be criminals from the Southern District of Texas, saying that the White House’s use of the statute was illegal.</p><p>The decision by the judge, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., was the most expansive ruling yet by any of the numerous jurists who are currently hearing challenges to the White House’s efforts to employ the powerful but rarely invoked law as part of its wide-ranging deportation plans.</p><div><p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.2000771/gov.uscourts.txsd.2000771.58.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">36-page ruling</a> by Judge Rodriguez, a President Trump appointee, amounted to a philosophical rejection of the White House’s attempts to transpose the Alien Enemies Act, which was passed in 1798 as the nascent United States was threatened by war with France, into the context of modern-day immigration policy.</p><p>The Supreme Court has already said that any Venezuelans the White House wants to expel under Mr. Trump’s proclamation invoking the act must be given a chance to challenge their removal. But Judge Rodriguez’s ruling went further, saying that the White House had improperly stretched the meaning of the law, which is supposed to be used only against members of a hostile foreign nation in times of declared war or during a military invasion.</p><p>While Judge Rodriguez’s decision applied only to Venezuelan immigrants in the Southern District of Texas — which includes cities like Houston, Brownsville and Laredo — it could have an effect, if not a binding one, on some of the other cases involving the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>“The court concludes that as a matter of law, the executive branch cannot rely on the A.E.A., based on the proclamation, to detain the named petitioners and the certified class, or to remove them from the country,” Judge Rodriguez wrote.</p><p>He also found that the “plain ordinary meaning” of the act’s language, like “invasion” and “predatory incursion,” referred to an attack by “military forces” and did not line up with Mr. Trump’s claims about the activities of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang, in a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union has so far filed at least eight lawsuits challenging the statute in Texas, New York, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Washington and Georgia. Federal judges in six of those cases have issued provisional orders stopping the administration from using it to expel Venezuelans accused of belonging to Tren de Aragua to a prison in El Salvador.</p><p>Lee Gelernt, the A.C.L.U.’s lead lawyer in the cases, praised the ruling by Judge Rodriguez.</p><p>“This decision correctly recognized that the president cannot simply declare there’s an invasion and invoke a wartime authority during peacetime,” Mr. Gelernt said. “As the court recognized, Congress never intended this law to be used in this manner.”</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.</p><p>Early in his decision, Judge Rodriguez rebuffed an argument by the Justice Department that he lacked the authority to even consider the White House’s use of the act, which has only been used three times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812 and during World Wars I and II.</p><p>Department lawyers have consistently maintained that even judges have no power to intrude on the president’s decisions in matters of foreign policy. And while Judge Rodriguez acknowledged that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president “broad powers,” he also said that judges still have the ability to determine whether presidents were using the law correctly.</p><p>“The court retains the authority to construe the A.E.A.’s terms and determine whether the announced basis for the proclamation properly invokes the statute,” he wrote.</p><p>Notably, however, the judge disclaimed authority to examine the truth of Mr. Trump’s underlying statements, including his assertion that Tren de Aragua is controlled by the Venezuelan government — a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/intelligence-trump-venezuelan-gang-alien-enemies.html" title="">claim that U.S. intelligence agencies disagree with</a>. The judge said that because such assessments were for the political branches to determine, he had to accept Mr. Trump’s findings at face value.</p><p>Still, Judge Rodriguez determined that Mr. Trump’s use of the law did not comport with the definitions of key terms in the act. He rejected, for example, the president’s claims that the arrival of large numbers of Tren de Aragua members to the United States could be construed as an invasion or what the act refers to as a “predatory incursion.”</p><p>“In the significant majority of the records, the use of ‘invasion’ and ‘predatory incursion’ referred to an attack by military forces,” Judge Rodriguez wrote, adding that those terms “involve an organized, armed force entering the United States to engage in conduct destructive of property and human life in a specific geographical area.”</p><p>Judge Rodriguez, 56, was the first Latino Mr. Trump nominated to the federal bench during his first term. He was a partner at the powerful Houston law firm Baker Botts, and for years worked in Latin America with International Justice Mission, an evangelical Christian group that fights human trafficking.</p><p>Judge Rodriguez’s order applies to a class of plaintiffs. That means that unless Thursday’s ruling is overturned on appeal, the government will be barred from detaining or removing anyone from his district using Mr. Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>While the A.C.L.U. has largely been successful in stopping the Trump administration from continuing to deport people under the act, it has not yet been able to bring back to the United States the first batch of nearly 140 Venezuelans who were removed under the law to El Salvador on March 15.</p><p>Those men remain in the custody of jailers at a notorious prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.</p><p>Last week, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union asked Judge James E. Boasberg, the chief judge in Federal District Court in Washington, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/lawyers-seek-migrant-return.html" title="">order the administration to return those men to U.S. soil</a> so they could get the due process they would have received if they had not been rushed out of the country.</p><p>In seeking to persuade Judge Boasberg that he had the authority to tell the White House to bring the men back, the lawyers cited a Supreme Court ruling in the case of another immigrant deported to El Salvador, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.</p><p>In that decision, the justices said the White House needed to “facilitate” the release from Salvadoran custody of Mr. Abrego Garcia, who Trump officials have repeatedly admitted was wrongly sent to El Salvador on the same group of three planes that transported the Venezuelan men.</p><p>The Justice Department was expected by the end of Thursday to file court papers opposing the A.C.L.U.’s request to bring the men back from El Salvador.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA2ZGFlMzVlLWZkOTYtNWZkNi1hYTE4LWNlOWVmZjFhNGNlNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#trump-mental-health-grants" data-source-id="100000010140628"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-c-bender"><img alt="Michael C.

The measure, known as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/23/us/gun-control-senate-supreme-court/senate-gun-control-bill?smid=url-share" title="">broke a decades-long impasse</a> between congressional Republicans and Democrats on addressing gun violence by focusing largely on improving mental health support for students.</p><div><p>But just as some of the mental health programs are starting, the Education Department canceled the funding this week and informed grant recipients that they would have to reapply for the money because of potential violations of federal civil rights law.</p><p>The department did not specify a civil rights law or provide the grant recipients with any evidence of violations, according to the notice reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>An Education Department spokeswoman confirmed that the grants had been discontinued because of a particular focus on increasing the diversity of psychologists, counselors and other mental health workers.</p><p>“Under the deeply flawed priorities of the Biden administration, grant recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions like recruiting quotas in ways that have nothing to do with mental health and could hurt the very students the grants are supposed to help,” said Madi Biedermann, the department’s deputy assistant secretary for communications. “We owe it to American families to ensure that taxpayer dollars are supporting evidence-based practices that are truly focused on improving students’ mental health.”</p><p>Ms. Biedermann declined to provide applications that the department viewed as discriminatory, citing privacy laws. Instead, she offered examples of specific provisions pulled from lengthy applications.</p><p>A provision in one application set a “diversity goal” of hiring eight nonwhite counselors out of a total of 24. A line in an additional application included training for mental health professionals that included helping counselors “recognize and challenge systemic injustices, antiracism and the pervasiveness of white supremacy to ethically support diverse communities.”</p><p>Another highlighted the importance of handling “racial stress and trauma” of students. One applicant’s training included understanding “the influences of racism and white privilege in education practice.”</p><p>The grant cancellations were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/school-mental-health-grants-trump-biden-dei-00bec2d96371f023ac56fe3f32f3e92f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by The Associated Press</a>.</p><p>Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who helped negotiate the legislation, said it was illegal for any president to halt funding approved by Congress and called on Republican supporters to stand up for the law. Three Republican senators, John Cornyn of Texas, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who <a href="https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/news/cornyn-tillis-collins-op-ed-the-bipartisan-safer-communities-act-is-cause-for-optimism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a column</a> in support of the law three years ago, did not return calls seeking comment.</p><p>“I’m raw about this because I sat in the room for a long time negotiating a really delicate compromise on a really tough issue,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview. “What’s the point of being in Congress and writing laws if the president can just ignore them? So, I’m angry that my Republican partners are not out there raising objections to what the president is doing.”</p><p>Christopher Rufo, the conservative activist who has spearheaded the assault on critical race theory and diversity, equity and inclusion programs, posted screenshots on social media this week of some grant applications, which he said was proof that the program was “being used to advance left-wing racialism and discrimination.”</p><p>“No more slush fund for activists under the guise of mental health,” Mr. Rufo <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1917314079406055660" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p><p>But Mary Wall, a former deputy assistant secretary for education involved in setting up the process to solicit bids for the program under the Biden administration, said it was a “gross overstep” to equate mental health services with the radicalization of children.</p><p>The application process favored programs that reflected the communities they served, she said. Programs aimed at training mental health professionals for predominantly minority communities, for example, received extra consideration if they could show how the training would be aimed at professionals with similar backgrounds. Ms. Wall said this was “a common-sense practice” with proven results.</p><p>“One of the first questions after every single school shooting is whether the student had access to mental health support and services,” Ms. Wall said. “It is no stretch to say that taking away this support introduces the risk of harm to school communities and students.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNlM2RkMGNlLTE1MWMtNTRhYS04NWJhLTc3NmUxN2YwMjlhOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#attorney-general-ban-subpoenae-reporter-notes" data-source-id="100000010140926"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charlie-savage"><img alt="Charlie Savage" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-charlie-savage/author-charlie-savage-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-charlie-savage/author-charlie-savage-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-charlie-savage/author-charlie-savage-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/devlin-barrett"><img alt="Devlin Barrett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-01T16:57:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 1, 2025, 12:57 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Attorney General Pam Bondi during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Justice Department unveiled <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/1ab9c310fb3ca943/0bbb362a-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a revised regulation</a> for leak investigations on Thursday, restoring the ability of federal investigators to use court orders, warrants and subpoenas to go after reporters’ phone records, notes or testimony under certain circumstances.</p><p>The move by Attorney General Pam Bondi rolls back <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/us/politics/justice-department-reporters.html" title="">a policy from her predecessor, Merrick B. Garland</a>, who was appointed by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., that flatly banned going after reporters’ information in leak investigations.</p><div><p>Mr. Garland’s policy was a major shift after two decades in which the Justice Department had become increasingly aggressive in prosecuting leaks as crimes, a tactic that was vanishingly rare in the 20th century <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/12/us/politics/government-leaks-garland-biden-administration.html" title="">but became routine in the 21st</a> under administrations of both parties.</p><p>Mr. Garland changed the policy after the revelation in 2021 that the Justice Department, under Attorney General William P. Barr, had secretly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/us/politics/times-reporter-emails-gag-order-trump-google.html" title="">pursued email records of reporters</a> at The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN during President Trump’s first term. At the time, Mr. Garland said that a flat ban on such tactics was necessary to “allow journalists to perform the crucial work of informing the public without fear of legal consequences.”</p><p>Ms. Bondi had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/leak-investigations-media.html" title="">foreshadowed that she intended to roll back Mr. Garland’s rule</a> in a memo last week, decrying leaks. The Justice Department, Ms. Bondi wrote, “will not tolerate unauthorized disclosures that undermine President Trump’s policies, victimize government agencies, and cause harm to the American people.”</p><p>A document detailing the new regulation says it is meant to address “growing concerns about federal government employees intentionally disseminating confidential, privileged, or otherwise protected information to the media or the purpose of undermining executive agencies’ legal obligations and policies.”</p><p>Media lawyers on Thursday morning were poring over the document, but at first glance, the language of the regulation appeared in many respects to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2017-01-20/title-28/chapter-I/part-50/section-50.10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revert to the department’s guidelines</a> before Mr. Garland’s changes, which had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/attorney-general-signs-new-rules-to-limit-access-to-journalists-records.html" title="">issued by the Obama administration</a>.</p><p>Generally, the rules require Ms. Bondi herself to sign off before investigators may use compulsory legal processes to seek information about news-gathering activities, like orders to phone companies to provide logs of communications or subpoenas for reporters’ notes or testimony.</p><p>The new regulation contains a version of a pre-Garland guardrail that states investigators should exhaust other potential means of obtaining the evidence they are seeking before going after reporters’ information. “The government should have made all reasonable attempts to obtain the information, communications records, or business records from alternative sources,” the regulation reads.</p><p>The regulation also says that investigators generally should first pursue negotiations with the affected member of the news media before requiring a phone company to turn over that journalist’s records, but it allows Ms. Bondi to make an exception if she decides such talks would “pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation, risk grave harm to national security, or present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1"

Kennedy Jr. has questioned the safety of vaccines for years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday announced plans to require all new vaccines to be tested against placebos and to develop new vaccines without using mRNA technology, moves that extend his reach deep into vaccine development and raise questions about whether Covid boosters will be available in the fall.</p><p>A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services called the requirement for placebo testing “a radical departure” from existing standards. But that will depend on how the department defines “new,” because most new vaccines are already tested either against placebos — inert substances — or, in some cases, against vaccines for other diseases.</p><div><p>Mr. Kennedy is one of the nation’s leading vaccine skeptics, and he has been vocal about his disdain for mRNA technology, which was used to develop coronavirus vaccines during the first Trump administration. He once wrote <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1619070787994140673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that “mRNA jabs don’t stop infection, don’t block transmission, don’t block mutants, don’t last, don’t work at all.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s activism in recent years included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" title="">petitioning the Food and Drug Administration</a> to pull the Covid vaccine off the market in 2021, during a deadly phase of the pandemic. He also urged the F.D.A. not to authorize Covid shots for children. Mr. Kennedy has also maintained that there could be a link between vaccines and autism, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/health/rfk-jr-autism-vaccines.html" title="">hired a discredited researcher</a> into his agency whose work aligns with that view.</p><p>Since becoming health secretary in February, Mr. Kennedy has made few high-profile pronouncements on vaccine policy, with the exception of his tepid endorsement of the measles shots in response to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/health/measles-southwest-outbreak.html" title="">the outbreak in Texas</a> that has killed two children and one adult. But he and the Trump administration have waded into the issue in other ways, by ordering a study on vaccines and autism and delaying approval of another Covid vaccine.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s announcements on Thursday represent an extraordinary use of his power as secretary to make decisions ordinarily left to career scientists at the F.D.A. The moves follow his recent instructions that parents of newborns considering vaccination should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/kennedy-vaccines-research.html" title="">“do your own research.”</a></p><p>Mr. Kennedy has said he intends to restore trust in the vaccine approval process, but Dr. Jesse Goodman, a former F.D.A. official and an infectious diseases doctor at Georgetown University, said the changes could erode trust.</p><p>“Questions never bother me,” Dr. Goodman said, “but it’s really worrisome when it seems like they’re so ubiquitous and so constant that they sow a huge amount of doubt — not just about the one thing, but about everything.”</p><p>Most immediately, Mr. Kennedy’s move could affect the next round of Covid booster shots, expected to become available in the fall. Both flu shots and Covid boosters have been authorized without extensive human trials to target new strains of the virus as it has evolved.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy says the new policy will not affect flu shots, but the future of Covid boosters is now in doubt. Andrew Nixon, the department spokesman, said that because so many people have been infected and now have immunity to Covid, new studies are required.</p><p>“As we’ve said before, trials from four years ago conducted in people without natural immunity no longer suffice,” he said. “A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot, which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years. The public deserves transparency and gold-standard science — especially with evolving products.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s plan for the placebo studies, first <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported by The Washington Post</a>, also raises ethical questions. It is considered unethical to deprive even a small group of patients of effective vaccines against deadly pathogens. In the case of Covid-19, new clinical studies could hold up authorization for boosters, which would leave the entire U.S. population vulnerable.</p><p>Dr. Ofer Levy, a Harvard vaccine researcher and a member of the F.D.A.’s vaccine advisory committee, said that would be “unacceptable,” and that officials must “thread the needle” to be sure the studies are done in a way that do not leave older and immunocompromised people unprotected from Covid.</p><p>“Tens of thousands of people can die without protection against Covid,” said Dr. Levy, who co-founded a company working on an opioid vaccine.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported about 23,000 deaths from Covid since September, with as many as 1,000 a week that month and in January. Still, uptake of the Covid boosters has been low: About 23 percent of adults got the updated Covid shot released in the fall, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the C.D.C.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a1.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One C.D.C. study</a> of the Covid boosters used in 2023 and 2024 found that they averted about 68,000 hospital stays, and were most effective in people who were older than 65 or immunocompromised.</p><p>The health secretary’s familiarity with vaccine trials stems at least in part from his reviews of decades-old vaccine approvals, including for the polio vaccine and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Mr. Kennedy has also helped represent plaintiffs in lawsuits against manufacturers.</p><p>He and the organization he founded and once led, Children’s Health Defense, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccines.html" title="">repeatedly complained</a> that vaccines are not tested against placebos in clinical trials when they are being developed. The organization has cited polio, hepatitis and meningitis vaccines as examples, all of which were introduced decades ago.</p><p>“Every other medicine is tested against a placebo,” Mr. Kennedy said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyxEo2kqo08" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a podcast in January 2020,</a> in claiming that vaccines are exempt from that requirement.</p><p>That, however, is not entirely correct. Cancer drugs and other medications authorized under the F.D.A.’s accelerated approval program are regularly authorized after trials without a placebo. And new vaccines, including the vaccines for Covid, were tested against placebos — inert substances, such as a saline injection, or in some cases against vaccines for other diseases.</p><p>“We’ve required placebo-controlled trials for most vaccines, and sometimes it’s an inert placebo, and sometimes it’s an irrelevant vaccine,” said Dr. Peter Marks, who was the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine official until he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/health/fda-vaccines-rfk-jr-peter-marks.html" title="">was forced out</a> in March. “The claim that we have not done randomized trials for pediatric vaccines aside from Covid is not correct.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has also raised concerns in the past about testing a vaccine against what many scientists consider a reasonable placebo: the same formula, but without the immune-activating agents. Mr. Kennedy has noted that the practice leaves uncertainty about whether ingredients in the formula could cause harm.</p><p>In addition to the new placebo requirement, Mr. Kennedy also announced a National Institutes of Health initiative to turbocharge the development of new inoculations for Covid, bird flu and seasonal flu — an effort that appears to be part of a broader assault on mRNA technology, or “platform.”</p><p>Since they were developed, Mr. Kennedy issued numerous social media posts about the mRNA shots, including <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1536430507763937284" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one positing that</a> the F.D.A.’s assessment of the Moderna shot for children in 2022 was “dishonest, and evidence that the public health establishment has abandoned science, logic, reason, rationality, empathy, health and medicine.”</p><p>The N.I.H. under the Trump administration has subjected studies related to the mRNA platform to strict scrutiny. Bills restricting the use of mRNA vaccines <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/prescription-pulse/2025/03/11/states-eye-mrna-vaccine-limits-for-a-hesitant-public-00223025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have popped up</a> in Republican-controlled state legislatures, including in Texas, Idaho and Kentucky.</p><p>The F.D.A. is also holding up approvals of a Covid vaccine that is not based on mRNA technology.</p><p>The agency was expected to issue a decision on April 1 regarding whether to issue a full approval of the more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/health/cdc-novavax-covid-vaccine.html" title="">traditional protein-based</a> Novavax Covid shot, which had been used under emergency authorization. The F.D.A. delayed the decision, though, asking the company to conduct additional research.</p><p>“I’m curious if this administration actually intends to just obliterate the Covid vaccine,” said Richard Hughes, a lawyer with the law firm Epstein Becker Green who represents some vaccine makers.</p><p>Pfizer and Moderna, makers of the mRNA Covid shots, did not respond to questions about whether updated shots will be available in the fall in the United States.</p><p>A spokesman for Moderna said the company has run clinical trials for its booster shots before and after their launch. During an earnings call Thursday, president Stephen Hoge said the company tests its vaccines against placebos. A policy change had not been communicated to the company directly, he said, but “we will absolutely engage constructively and making sure we understand what those needs are and that we fulfill them.”</p><p>The new N.I.H. initiative, meanwhile, would develop a “next-generation vaccine platform” that would be “fully government-owned,” the department said. The N.I.H. helped develop the mRNA platform, and the vaccine maker Moderna <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/moderna-pays-us-government-400m-catch-payment-under-new-covid-19-vaccine-license" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid the government</a> hundreds of millions of dollars to license a key patent on the vaccine, though the company and the government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/us/moderna-vaccine-patent.html" title="">later got into a dispute</a> over the patent rights.</p><p>The mRNA platform relies on small bits of genetic code, which generated <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8115834/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online rumors and conspiracy</a> theories that it was being used to insert microchips into vaccine recipients. The new platform, by contrast, would rely on a more traditional method of vaccine development, which uses inactivated viruses to provoke an immune response.</p><p>The department said the new platform would be developed using <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/beta-propiolactone.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beta-Propilactone,</a> which is already a component in vaccine development but is considered a hazardous substance by the Environmental Protection Agency when people are exposed to it in large doses.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjkyNTU5NmMtNWM2ZC01MmUyLTg2ZjctMTliNzRiMTg2NTU5"><div id="6925596c-5c6d-52e2-86f7-19b74b186559" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#6925596c-5c6d-52e2-86f7-19b74b186559"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-feuer"><img alt="Alan Feuer" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-01T16:06:48.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 1, 2025, 12:06 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>A federal judge has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime law, to deport Venezuelans it has deemed to be criminals from the judge’s home district in southern Texas to a prison in El Salvador.</p><p>The decision by the judge, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., a Trump appointee, was the most expansive ruling so far by any of the eight federal jurists who are currently hearing challenges to the White House’s use of the statute as part of its wide-ranging deportation plans.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvM2Q4OWUwNDMtZjA1MS01OTY3LTljZGMtZjZmY2FhMTg4MzNk"><div id="3d89e043-f051-5967-9cdc-f6fcaa18833d" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#3d89e043-f051-5967-9cdc-f6fcaa18833d"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-gold"><img alt="Michael Gold" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-michael-gold/author-michael-gold-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-01T16:05:47.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 1, 2025, 12:05 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Asked about President Trump ousting Michael Waltz, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that Trump should have fired Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for sharing information about military strikes in Signal chats. “They’re firing the wrong guy,” he told reporters. “They should be firing Hegseth.”</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L.

He holds the position of secretary of state and national security adviser, something that no other official has done simultaneously since Henry Kissinger held both titles under the Nixon and Ford administrations. Mr. Rubio has also been serving as the acting head of both the gutted U.S.A.I.D. and the National Archives.</p><p>The Kissinger experiment has not been considered a success by most historians. The national security adviser is supposed to help adjudicate among competing arguments inside a national security establishment, and thus must often resolve differences among the State Department, the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies, among others. Mr. Kissinger was ultimately removed from the post of national security adviser and replaced with Brent Scowcroft.</p><p>But Mr. Trump is not running a second administration that has much of a true historical parallel.</p><p>One person with knowledge of the discussions said Mr. Rubio had indicated some time ago that he would be willing to serve for roughly six months if he were asked to do so.</p><p>Mr. Rubio ran against Mr. Trump in 2016, but they have developed a close working relationship in recent months, according to several top administration officials. Mr. Waltz is being provided a soft landing and praise as he departs the current role, while filling the U.N. ambassador spot left open when Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/stefanik-trump-cabinet.html" title="">abruptly pulled his nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik</a>, Republican from New York.</p><p>A person with knowledge of the events said that Mr. Waltz was not seen as an easy fit ideologically for the president or the rest of his team. Discussions about replacing him have been occurring in private for weeks, but they intensified after the leaked Signal chat.</p><p>Mr. Waltz did not join Mr. Trump for a trip to Michigan marking his first 100 days in office as had been planned, although the person with knowledge of the events said that was because he was handling a foreign policy matter.</p><p>The decision to remove Mr. Waltz was so abrupt that many on Mr. Trump’s staff only learned of it Thursday morning, as it was being discussed among senior officials in the White House. By midmorning, top aides were told it was true that he would be removed, and to await Mr. Trump’s statement, according to the person with knowledge of the events.</p><p>Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman, learned of Mr. Rubio’s new role during a briefing with reporters, after Mr. Trump posted about it.</p><p>The selection of the next national security adviser will be a critical one, at a moment when the president’s top national security and foreign policy aides have differed sharply on how to handle three of America’s most potent adversaries: China, Russia and Iran.</p><p>Mr. Trump is making the change just two weeks before his first major trip abroad, to Saudi Arabia and other Arab capitals in the Middle East, and in the midst of tense negotiations with Moscow and Tehran. Mr. Waltz joined him in Rome a week ago, for the funeral of Pope Francis, and was in the background of the meeting in St. Peter’s Basilica with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Waltz, a veteran who had favored a muscular U.S. foreign policy for many years before Mr. Trump’s rise, had struggled to prove his bona fides to his base.</p><p>He also barely had time to organize a staff, much less tackle the hardest issues facing the president. Ordinarily a new national security adviser writes the administration’s national security strategy, often a yearlong process that involves hashing out differences among government agencies and cabinet members.</p><p>On some major issues — including how to engage China on its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific, its fast-growing nuclear program, its sophisticated cyberattacks on the United States and its allies and its effort to reunite Taiwan with the mainland — the administration has barely gotten started.</p><p>But Mr. Waltz was also seen by the senior team closest to Mr. Trump as struggling to show he could manage the role while managing his relationship with the president. One senior official said he had at various points been seen as seeking to minimize Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff and the adviser in the building who is closest to Mr. Trump.</p><p>On Thursday morning, just as word of his ouster was beginning to circulate in national security circles in Washington, Mr. Waltz appeared on Fox News. A person with direct knowledge of the situation said that Mr. Waltz was aware that something was going to happen before he went on.</p><p>Mr. Waltz, who never made the public evolution toward Mr. Trump’s foreign policy views that Mr. Rubio did over the past several years, has been arguing internally for sharp sanctions against Russia if it fails to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine. Mr. Waltz made that suggestion as an option for handling Russia as recently as Monday at a meeting with the president and senior members of his national security team, according to a person with knowledge of what took place.</p><p>So far, Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly voiced skepticism of the long-running United States efforts helping to defend Ukraine, has been reluctant to take anything but symbolic action against Russia, though at times he has threatened on social media to impose sanctions and tariffs.</p><p>And Mr. Waltz has been under siege by external allies of Mr. Trump for weeks, including the far-right activist Laura Loomer. Ms. Loomer had prompted the president to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-meeting-laura-loomer.html" title="">have Mr. Waltz fire several National Security Council staff members</a> for what she perceived as disloyalty to Mr. Trump, after an extraordinary Oval Office meeting. Ms. Loomer had also aggressively targeted Mr. Wong.</p><p>Mr. Trump had been loath to fire anyone from cabinet-level positions since he took office a second time, seeking to avoid the headlines about the chaos that engulfed his first term.</p><p>Mr. Trump fired his first national security adviser, Michael T.

She said that the secretaries of the Mexican treasury, finance, economy and commerce ministries would continue working “on options to improve our trade balance and advance outstanding issues for the benefit of both countries.” </p><p>Even though Trump signed executive orders earlier in the week that lessened some tariffs for carmakers, Mexico — which is a major supplier to the U.S. auto industry — remains subject to 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as on goods that fall outside of its free trade agreement with the United States. </p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuri Cortez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzcxN2IzZTZmLTU0ZDItNWY2ZC1hM2Y4LTBjMmIzYzhhMjhmOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/01/us/trump-news#may-day-protests-trump" data-source-id="100000010140755"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-01T14:56:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 1, 2025, 10:56 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="01trump-news-protests-zzzz"><div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>Demonstrators in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia protested the Trump administration on Thursday.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Thousands of people streamed onto the green grass of Union Park in Chicago, the streets of downtown Los Angeles and the Supreme Court steps in Washington on Thursday to celebrate labor victories and oppose actions of the Trump administration.</p><p>Demonstrators said they were angered by President Trump’s plans to cut education funding, roll back workers’ rights and carry out mass deportations. “He’s tearing apart our Constitution,” said Bill Hincks, 40, a union leader from the Chicago suburb of Oak Forest.</p><div><p>Labor groups made up a significant portion of the rally in Chicago on Thursday, though pro-Palestinian activists and anti-Trump demonstrators swelled the ranks. The event was one of more than 1,000 protests in cities across the country, organized by a loose coalition of grass-roots activist groups known as <a href="https://www.fiftyfifty.one/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50501</a>, as well as labor, nonprofit and civil rights organizations, to coincide with traditional May Day labor rallies.</p><p>A separate effort, billed as a National Law Day of Action, brought legal professionals to the Supreme Court and other locations to push for judicial independence and oppose the Trump administration’s efforts to weaponize the Justice Department and intimidate law firms.</p><p>Large crowds were anticipated in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, where police closed streets. The area around City Hall in Philadelphia will also be shut down for an evening event where Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, is slated to speak.</p><p>A rally in downtown Los Angeles focused largely on migrant rights. Jose Servín, 31, held a sign that read, “Come for one of us, come for all of us.” Mr. Servin is an organizer representing a statewide coalition of advocacy groups marching on Thursday.</p><p>“I found a place here where I can succeed, where I can thrive, where I can plant roots,” said Mr. Servín, who immigrated as a child. “And I’m going to fight like hell to protect that.”</p><p>Organizers in small towns say they are also expecting dozens, if not hundreds, of participants at protests in front of municipal buildings and public schools, with some wearing red to indicate support for public education.

JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat who first ran for office in 2018 because of his revulsion to Mr. Trump’s first term, called for an even larger outcry during a speech on Sunday in New Hampshire. </p><p>“It’s time to fight everywhere and all at once,” he said. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption.
