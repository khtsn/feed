Mindy McCormick, 67, read that her insurer would soon stop covering the weight loss drug Wegovy, which she had been taking for more than two years.</p><p><em>What?</em> she remembers thinking. <em>They’re just going to take it away from me?</em></p><p>She sent photos of the letter to her physician, Dr. Andrew Kraftson. His inbox was full of panicked emails from patients. Nearly 9,000 people across the state had received similar letters from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.</p><p>Many of Dr. Kraftson’s patients asked the same question as Ms. McCormick: “What are we going to do now?”</p><p>Over the past few months, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the state’s largest insurer, has scaled back on coverage of the weight-loss drugs Wegovy, Zepbound and Saxenda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>These drugs are life-changing — in some people’s minds, lifesaving. But they can cost over $1,000 a month without insurance. The decision in Michigan reflects a shift underway nationwide, as insurers and employers pull back on paying for weight-loss drugs. This year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/business/obesity-drugs-insurance-north-carolina.html" title="">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/health/obesity-ozempic-wegovy-west-virginia.html" title="">West Virginia</a> have both restricted coverage for the medications for state employees. Some large private employers have also dropped coverage.</p><p>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, like many other plans, will continue to cover similar drugs that treat people with diabetes, like Ozempic.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
