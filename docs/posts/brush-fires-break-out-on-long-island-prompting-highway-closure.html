Two structures also burned in the fire, he said.</p><p>“We maximized our firefighting capabilities to stop this fire from spreading and then we tried to contain it,” Mr. Romaine said. “But it is not under control as I speak.”</p><p>Mr. Romaine added that he did not expect the fire to be fully out until Sunday because of the high winds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The fire in the Westhampton area was roughly 50 percent contained by Saturday evening, Rudy Sunderman, the Suffolk County fire coordinator, said at the news conference.</p><p>Mr. Romaine said in a statement earlier that more than 80 agencies were involved in fighting three fires in eastern Long Island.</p><p>“The National Guard has begun water dumps,” he said in a statement.</p><p>An HH-60W Jolly Green II helicopter from the 106th Rescue Wing and three New York Army National Guard helicopters based in Ronkonkoma were helping in the response, the New York National Guard said in a news release.</p><p>Fire trucks and crews from the Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base in Westhampton Beach were also deployed. The base was evacuated as a precautionary measure, the National Guard said.</p><p>Bill Dalton, a former chief of the Westhampton Beach Fire Department who is helping coordinate his department’s response, said several departments have deployed brush trucks, which are smaller fire trucks designed to fight wildfires.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Drones were mobilized to get a bird’s-eye view of the fires, which stretched in a seven-mile radius in the area around Westhampton and Eastport on the South Shore.</p><p>“We have a lot of assets on the ground, lot of communication as to where the hot spots are,” he said. “They’re popping up all over.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The New York State Police confirmed that all lanes of the Sunrise Highway were closed eastbound between Exit 62 and Exit 64.
