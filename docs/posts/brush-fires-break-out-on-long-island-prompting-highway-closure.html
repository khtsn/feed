By the evening, three had been extinguished and the fourth, in the Westhampton area, was 50 percent contained, Rudy Sunderman, the Suffolk County fire coordinator, said at a news conference on Saturday evening.</p><p>Two structures had been burned and one firefighter had been hospitalized with second-degree burns to the face, Ed Romaine, the Suffolk County executive, said at the news conference.</p><p>“We maximized our firefighting capabilities to stop this fire from spreading and then we tried to contain it,” Mr. Romaine said. “But it is not under control as I speak.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Romaine added that he did not expect the Westhampton fire to be fully out until Sunday because there were high winds in the forecast.</p><p>Fire danger risk remained high on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley on Sunday, <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/wildfires/fire-danger-map" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Although the humidity was forecast to be slightly higher than it had been on Saturday, wind gusts of up to 30 miles per hour were expected by the afternoon, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>Mr. Romaine said in a statement earlier that more than 80 agencies were involved in fighting three fires in eastern Long Island.</p><p>An HH-60W Jolly Green II helicopter from the 106th Rescue Wing and three New York Army National Guard helicopters based in Ronkonkoma were helping in the response, the New York National Guard said in a news release.</p><p>Fire trucks and crews from the Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base in Westhampton Beach were also deployed. The base was evacuated as a precautionary measure, the National Guard said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Bill Dalton, a former chief of the Westhampton Beach Fire Department who is helping coordinate his department’s response, said several departments have deployed brush trucks, which are smaller fire trucks designed to fight wildfires.</p><p>Drones were mobilized to get a bird’s-eye view of the fires, which stretched in a seven-mile radius in the area around Westhampton and Eastport on the South Shore.</p><p>“We have a lot of assets on the ground, lot of communication as to where the hot spots are,” he said. “They’re popping up all over.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The New York State Police said on Saturday that all lanes of the Sunrise Highway were closed eastbound between Exit 62 and Exit 64.

Kathy Hochul said the fires were in the Pine Barrens, <a href="https://pb.state.ny.us/central-pine-barrens/overview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 105,000-acre nature park</a>. The governor declared a state of emergency on Saturday afternoon, said a spokesman, Avi Small.</p><p>“We are in close communication with local partners on Long Island to coordinate assistance and make sure they have the resources they need to protect their communities,” Ms. Hochul <a href="https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1898466526715433256" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/08xp-wildfires-tfjh/08xp-wildfires-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/08xp-wildfires-tfjh/08xp-wildfires-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/08/multimedia/08xp-wildfires-tfjh/08xp-wildfires-tfjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A huge plume of gray smoke is visible in the distance.

Kieran Marsicovetere, 34, of East Quogue, said he saw heavy smoke and “a few ashes falling from the sky” early in the afternoon.</p><p>The situation did not appear to be nearly as dire as brush fires that burned thousands of acres in the same area in 1995, he said. Still, he said, he was “immediately concerned.”</p><p>“It’s a scary situation, especially with the wildfires in the Carolinas and California,” he said. “The Pine Barrens are always a concerning spot.”</p><p>On Montauk Highway in Westhampton, police vehicles blocked roads leading to the Francis S. Gabreski Airport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Salvatore Fracapane, 19, watched live television coverage of the fires at his job at a convenience store nearby.
