The example was among several documented by researchers at NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, in a Thursday report that called DeepSeek “a disinformation machine.”</p><p>In the case of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/31/world/asia/un-china-xinjiang-uyghurs.html" title="">the repression of Uyghurs</a> in Xinjiang, which the United Nations in 2022 said may have amounted to crimes against humanity, <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/new-chinese-ai-model-claims-to-outperform-top-dogs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cybernews</a>, an industry news website, reported that the chatbot produced responses that claimed that China’s policies there “have received widespread recognition and praise from the international community.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/world/asia/deepseek-china-censorship.html" title="">has found similar examples</a> when prompting the chatbot for answers about China’s handling of the Covid pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A portrait of Chinese President Xi Jinping outside Yarkant in northwestern China’s Xinjiang region.

He said China was adept at using new technology in its information campaigns.</p><p>Like OpenAI’s Chat GPT, Anthropic’s Claude or Microsoft’s Copilot, DeepSeek uses large language modeling, a way of learning skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital text culled from the internet to anticipate phrases on a subject, creating an element of unpredictability when providing answers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>NewsGuard found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/technology/ai-chatbots-disinformation.html" title="">a similar propensity</a> for disinformation and conspiratorial ideas in ChatGPT after it became public in 2022. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/technology/chatbots-hallucination-rates.html" title="">tendency to “hallucinate,”</a> or make up a response that is inaccurate, irrelevant or nonsensical, continues to afflict chatbots, including DeepSeek, according to a <a href="https://www.vectara.com/blog/deepseek-r1-hallucinates-more-than-deepseek-v3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new report</a> by Vectara, a company that helps others adopt A.I. tools.</p><p>Like all Chinese companies, though, DeepSeek must also abide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/technology/china-united-states-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">by China’s strict government control and censorship online</a>, which is intended, above all, to mute opposition to the Communist Party’s leadership.</p><p>DeepSeek declines, for example, to respond to sensitive questions about the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, and avoids or deflects those about other topics that, are politically taboo within China. Those include the student protests that were crushed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/opinion/tiananmen-square-chinese-massacre.html" title="">Tiananmen Square</a> in 1989 or the status of Taiwan, the island democracy that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/asia/china-taiwan-blockade-drills.html" title="">China claims as its own</a>.</p><p>Researchers and others testing DeepSeek say the guardrails built into it are clear in the way it responds to prompts. DeepSeek did not respond to questions about the government’s influence over its product.</p><p>NewsGuard’s researchers tested the chatbot using a sampling of false narratives about China, Russia and Iran and found that DeepSeek’s answers mirrored China’s official views 80 percent of the time. A third of its responses included explicitly false claims that have been spread by Chinese officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In one test involving Russia’s war in Ukraine, the chatbot sidestepped a question about the baseless claim that in 2022 the Ukrainians staged the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/video/russia-ukraine-bucha-massacre-takeaways.html" title="">massacre of civilians at Bucha</a>, a village on the approach to the country’s capital, Kyiv. Video and call records from the village obtained by The New York Times show that the perpetrators were Russian.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A test of DeepSeek’s chatbot sidestepped a question about the massacre of civilians at Bucha, Ukraine, in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The Chinese government has always adhered to the principles of objectivity and fairness and does not comment on specific events without comprehensive understanding and conclusive evidence,” the chatbot responded, according to NewsGuard.</p><p>The response echoed public statements by Chinese officials after the massacre occurred, including the country’s representative at the United Nations, Zhang Jun.</p><p>China has long pursued a robust global information strategy to bolster its own geopolitical standing and to undermine its rivals, using <a href="https://education.cfr.org/learn/learning-journey/tools-foreign-policy/what-is-soft-power" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“soft” power</a> tools like state media, as well as covert disinformation campaigns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In <a href="https://public-assets.graphika.com/atlas-highlights-china.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a separate report</a> this week, Graphika documented a series of influence campaigns between November and January.</p><p>One targeted Uniqlo, the Japanese retailer, because it doesn’t use cotton from Xinjiang because of concerns about forced labor in the largely Muslim region. Another sought to discredit <a href="https://safeguarddefenders.com/en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Safeguard Defenders</a>, a human rights organization based in Madrid, using inauthentic accounts on numerous platforms — including X, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Gettr and BlueSky — to spread false claims, including sexually explicit ones.</p><p>Laura Harth, Safeguard Defenders’ campaign director, said its researchers have faced “a renewed multilingual and sustained attack aimed at discrediting the organization’s work, threatening, intimidating or slandering some of its staff members, and attempting to sow doubt about its activities.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Steven Lee Myers covers misinformation and disinformation from San Francisco.
