The talks are aimed at ironing out details of a possible limited cease-fire in what could be a crucial step toward a full cessation of hostilities in Russia’s war with Ukraine.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine both agreed last week to halt strikes on energy infrastructure temporarily, but how and when to put in place that partial truce has yet to be decided <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/europe/russia-ukraine-power-energy-grid.html" title="">as attacks persist</a>. Ukraine has accused Russia of carrying out continued attacks on energy and civilian targets: On Monday, Ukrainian officials <a href="https://t.me/ermaka2022/6026" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> a missile strike on a residential area in the northeastern city of Sumy injured at least 74 people, including more than a dozen children.</p><p>The meetings — held in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, with American representatives mediating — are expected to focus on hammering out those details and on safety for shipping in the Black Sea.</p><p>Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said on Monday that the Russian delegation would discuss shipping in the Black Sea and the restoration of a grain deal agreed to in 2022 that allowed millions of tons of Ukrainian grain to be exported. Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-grain-deal.html" title="">withdrew from the agreement in 2023</a>, saying that Western sanctions were severely limiting its own ability to export agricultural products.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Peskov added that President Vladimir V. Putin was being kept informed about the discussions and that no additional information would be released publicly while the negotiations take place.</p><p>The Russian news agency Interfax reported that Grigory B. Karasin, a senior Russian diplomat and lawmaker who is coleading the Russian delegation, had described the talks as “creative.”</p><p>“It is important to stay in touch and understand each other’s point of view,” Mr. Karasin added. “We manage to do that.”</p><p><a href="https://x.com/rustem_umerov/status/1903833939698930144" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rustem Umerov</a>, the Ukrainian defense minister, said his delegation’s talks on Sunday had lasted about five hours. “The discussion was productive and focused — we addressed key points including energy,” he <a href="https://x.com/rustem_umerov/status/1903908261016870980" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>, without offering details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Serhii Leshchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president’s office, said that the delegation from Kyiv would hold additional discussions with U.S. officials on Monday, after the Moscow-Washington talks. But he cautioned against expecting an imminent agreement, telling Ukrainian news media that “negotiations are usually not concluded in a single day; they sometimes take months.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, in Kyiv, the capital, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Steven Witkoff, whom President Trump has tapped to be his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/witkoff-trumps-russia-putin.html" title="">personal envoy to Mr. Putin</a>, has said that the ultimate goal of the talks is a 30-day full cease-fire that would allow time for negotiations on a permanent truce.</p><p>But the path toward such a truce has been shaky. Moscow continues to insist on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/trump-putin-call-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">maximalist positions</a>, including about asserting territorial control and ensuring Ukraine never joins NATO. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly said that it will not concede to the Kremlin’s demands and has accused Mr. Putin of stalling for time.</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/us-ukraine-talks-rubio-saudi-arabia.html" title="">previous cease-fire discussions</a>, which involved top government officials from all sides, this new round will focus on technical matters and will mostly involve diplomats and government advisers. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, said the American delegation would include some of his own staff members, along with Michael Anton, policy planning director at the State Department, and aides to the national security adviser, Michael Waltz.</p><h2 id="link-291b262">The Russian delegation</h2><p>Mr. Peskov said on Friday that Mr. Putin had personally selected the negotiators for the talks.

He added that a third party would have to monitor the cease-fire and suggested that the United States could do so.</p><p>While Russia and Ukraine may find common ground in talks about energy and shipping, both have laid out conditions for a complete cessation of hostilities that appear irreconcilable — a sign of the steep challenges ahead in any broader peace negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-da926ab">Moscow’s position</h2><p>Last week, Mr. Putin told Mr. Trump in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/europe/trump-putin-call-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">telephone conversation</a> that Russia would agree to a temporary truce only if Ukraine stopped mobilizing soldiers, training troops or importing weapons for the duration of any pause in fighting.</p><p>Mr. Putin also demanded the complete halt of foreign military aid and intelligence to Kyiv, calling it “the key condition for preventing an escalation of the conflict and making progress toward its resolution through political and diplomatic means,” <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76477" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Kremlin’s readout</a> of the call.</p><p>The White House said that military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElUUgflrQjE&amp;t=1122s&amp;ab_channel=TheWhiteHouse" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would continue</a> despite the Kremlin’s demands. But the Trump administration has been less clear on Moscow’s calls for territorial concessions and at times even appeared to align with the Kremlin’s stance.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&amp;ab_channel=TuckerCarlson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">echoed a Kremlin talking point</a> on Sunday when he tried to legitimize <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-referendums-annexation.html" title="">the staged referendums</a> that the Russian occupation forces held in parts of Ukraine to justify the annexation of those territories taken by military force. “There is a view within the country of Russia that these are Russian territories,” Mr. Witkoff told Fox News. “There are referendums within these territories that justify these actions.” Those referendums were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/world/europe/us-decries-russian-move-to-annex-parts-of-ukraine-as-a-land-grab.html" title="">widely denounced as fraudulent and illegal</a> by the international community.</p><p>Fundamentally, Russia’s position regarding the conflict has remained the same. The Kremlin says it wants to “eliminate the root causes of the crisis” — essentially demanding that Ukraine capitulate. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-15ef15f6">Kyiv’s position</h2><p>Ukraine had previously agreed to an unconditional 30-day truce to cease all combat operations, at the urging of the Trump administration. But after Moscow said that it would support only a partial cease-fire on energy infrastructure, Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">spoke with Mr. Trump</a> and agreed to the limited truce.</p><p>In recent days, Ukrainian officials have set out red lines going into negotiations: Kyiv will never accept Russian sovereignty over occupied Ukrainian territory; it will not agree to be blocked from joining NATO or to reduce the size of its army; and it must have security guarantees as part of any peace settlement.</p><p>Many Ukrainian officials and analysts have expressed doubt that even a limited cease-fire would hold for long, noting that previous truces between Moscow and Kyiv were routinely violated, with each side blaming the other.</p><p>“I do not believe in a cease-fire. We’ve been through this before,” Kostyantyn Yeliseev, a veteran diplomat and former Ukrainian deputy foreign minister who took part in cease-fire negotiations in 2014 and 2015, said in an interview.</p><h2 id="link-b30f02b">What’s next?</h2><p>Mr. Witkoff said on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-03-19/trump-likely-to-meet-russia-s-putin-says-witkoff-video" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview with Bloomberg News</a> that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin were “likely” to meet in Saudi Arabia within weeks. American officials will also probably continue talks with their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in the Middle East to discuss details of a limited truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But the foundations of the diplomatic process have been wobbly, analysts said, with Moscow and Kyiv ready to continue fighting.</p><p>“Both sides still believe that they can continue the war regardless of the American position,” said Dmitry Kuznets, a military analyst with the Russian news outlet Meduza, which operates from Latvia after being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/world/europe/russia-media-meduza.html" title="">outlawed by the Kremlin</a>.</p><p>He added, “Moscow’s and Kyiv’s visions of what an agreement could look like are still infinitely far from each other.”</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- --> and <!-- -->Minho Kim<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
