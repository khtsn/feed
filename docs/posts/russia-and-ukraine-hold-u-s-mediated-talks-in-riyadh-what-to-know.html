A Ukrainian official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations, said talks continued on Tuesday morning, and <a href="https://t.me/ukrpravda_news/59616" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrainian news media</a> said they had ended after about one hour. The discussions have been aimed at finding common ground between Kyiv and Moscow, but both sides have cautioned against expecting an imminent deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-11c3ec86">What’s on the agenda</h2><p>The meetings in Riyadh were expected to focus on the details of a tentative agreement between Russia and Ukraine to temporarily halt strikes on energy infrastructure.</p><p>But Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said on Tuesday that the sides mostly discussed the safety of shipping in the Black Sea and the restoration of a grain deal agreed to in 2022 that allowed millions of tons of Ukrainian grain to be exported. Mr. Lavrov said that Russia was in favor of restoring the grain deal, but only if unspecified Russian demands were met.</p><p>Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said on Tuesday that the Russian government was studying the results of the meeting between Russian and American delegations. He called the talks “technical” and said that the results would not be made public.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky had said that Ukraine would prepare a list of infrastructure that could be included in the cease-fire agreement. He added that a third party would have to monitor the cease-fire and suggested that the United States could do so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A grain terminal in Izmail, Ukraine, in 2023.

The Kremlin says it wants to “eliminate the root causes of the crisis” — essentially demanding that Ukraine capitulate. </p><h2 id="link-15ef15f6">Kyiv’s position</h2><p>Ukraine had previously agreed to an unconditional 30-day truce to cease all combat operations, at the urging of the Trump administration. But after Moscow said that it would support only a partial cease-fire on energy infrastructure, Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">spoke with Mr. Trump</a> and agreed to the limited truce.</p><p>In recent days, Ukrainian officials have set out red lines going into negotiations: Kyiv will never accept Russian sovereignty over occupied Ukrainian territory; it will not agree to be blocked from joining NATO or to reduce the size of its army; and it must have security guarantees as part of any peace settlement.</p><p>Many Ukrainian officials and analysts have expressed doubt that even a limited cease-fire would hold for long, noting that previous truces between Moscow and Kyiv were routinely violated, with each side blaming the other.</p><p>“I do not believe in a cease-fire. We’ve been through this before,” Kostyantyn Yeliseyev, a veteran diplomat and former Ukrainian deputy foreign minister who took part in cease-fire negotiations in 2014 and 2015, said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-b30f02b">What’s next?</h2><p>Mr. Witkoff said on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-03-19/trump-likely-to-meet-russia-s-putin-says-witkoff-video" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview with Bloomberg News</a> that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin were “likely” to meet in Saudi Arabia within weeks. American officials will also probably continue talks with their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in the Middle East to discuss details of a limited truce.</p><p>But the foundations of the diplomatic process have been wobbly, analysts said, with Moscow and Kyiv ready to continue fighting.</p><p>“Both sides still believe that they can continue the war regardless of the American position,” said Dmitry Kuznets, a military analyst with the Russian news outlet Meduza, which operates from Latvia after being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/world/europe/russia-media-meduza.html" title="">outlawed by the Kremlin</a>.</p><p>He added, “Moscow’s and Kyiv’s visions of what an agreement could look like are still infinitely far from each other.”</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- --> and <!-- -->Minho Kim<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
