Immediately after the first 2024 presidential debate, between Mr. Trump and President Biden, Mr. Lichtman was also quick to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/opinion/biden-harris-trump-democrats.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">warn</a> that Mr. Biden dropping out of the race could be a “tragic mistake for Democrats,” leading him directly into an <a href="https://x.com/AllanLichtman/status/1814755577396142256" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online battle</a> with the forecaster Nate Silver. The confidence is rooted in Mr. Lichtman’s simple, history-driven model, which tunes out polls and pollsters and instead focuses on 13 true-or-false questions that he says hold the “keys” to the White House.</p><p>So can a model that looks all the way back to the horse and buggy days survive in an unprecedented election year marked by criminal proceedings, an assassination attempt and that Democratic switcheroo? Mr. Lichtman is confident that it can.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>And what is his prediction in this unpredictable year? Well, for that, you’ll have to watch the video.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
