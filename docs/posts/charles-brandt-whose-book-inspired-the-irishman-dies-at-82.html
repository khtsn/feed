He was 82.</p><p>The death, at a hospice facility, was confirmed by his brother-in-law, Gary Goldsmith, who did not specify a cause.</p><p>Mr. Brandt’s book purported to solve the mystery of Mr. Hoffa’s disappearance and presumed death in 1975. He identified Hoffa’s killer as Frank Sheeran, a World War II veteran and truck driver who had been recruited into the underworld by the Mafia boss <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/22/archives/bufalino-sentenced-on-extortion-charge-reputed-mobster-gets-four.html" title="">Russell Bufalino</a>.</p><p>Mr. Sheeran did some enforcement work for Mr. Bufalino, who introduced him to Mr. Hoffa, who said to Mr. Sheeran, “I heard you paint houses.” That was apparently mob slang for killing people — with the word “paint” meaning blood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a series of interviews over five years, Mr. Sheeran told Mr. Brandt that he had been ordered to kill Mr. Hoffa, who had just been released from prison and was trying to regain power in the underworld.</p><p>Mr. Sheeran recalled luring him to a house in Detroit for a supposed meeting with organized crime figures.</p><p>“When Jimmy saw that the house was empty, that nobody came out of any of the rooms to greet him, he knew right away what it was,” Mr. Sheeran was quoted as saying in Mr. Brandt’s book. “If Jimmy had taken his piece with him he would have gone for it.”</p><p>But Mr. Hoffa, alas, was not carrying a gun.</p><p>“Jimmy Hoffa got shot twice at a decent range — not too close or the paint splatters back at you — in the back of the head behind his right ear,” Mr. Sheeran said. “Then I dropped the piece on the linoleum, went out the front door with my head down.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I Heard You Paint Houses” was apparently mob slang for killing people — with the word “paint” meaning blood.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Steerforth Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In Mr. Sheeran’s telling, two “cleaners,” as they were called, then arrived. They stuffed Mr. Hoffa into a body bag and had him cremated — not buried under Giants Stadium in New Jersey, as had long been rumored.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I Heard You Paint Houses” was a New York Times best seller.</p><p>“The book Brandt has written gives new meaning to the term ‘guilty pleasure,’” Bryan Burrough, a Vanity Fair correspondent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/books/killing-him-softly.html" title="">wrote</a> in The New York Times Book Review. “Brandt keeps the focus tightly on Sheeran and Hoffa, quick-marching the reader through Sheeran’s rise from carnival gofer to klepto-trucker to union organizer to trusted assassin.”</p><p>Mr. De Niro, who had starred in Mr. Scorsese’s Mafia movies “Goodfellas” (1990) and “Casino” (1995), read “I Heard You Paint Houses” and was overwhelmed by Mr. Sheeran’s story. He told Mr. Scorsese that they should adapt it for the screen.</p><p>“He sat down, he started talking about the book, but he became — I could see he was really emotionally involved with the character,” Mr. Scorsese <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a29682520/martin-scorsese-interview-irishman-robert-de-niro-marvel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Esquire magazine in 2019, just before the film premiered. “So much that he couldn’t describe — he couldn’t really speak.”</p><p>Critics praised the movie.</p><p>“What interests Scorsese — what he has always cared most about — aren’t facts but feelings,” A.O. Scott, who at the time was one of The Times’s two chief movie critics, wrote in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/movies/the-irishman-review.html" title="">his review</a>. “Like many of his other films, ‘The Irishman’ spends some time mapping the structures of power and the codes of behavior that govern its particular slice of reality.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The film, Mr. Scott wrote, was “surprisingly, surpassingly delicate.”</p><p>But it was fiercely criticized by journalists and Mafia experts, who said Mr. Sheeran had exaggerated (at best) or fabricated (at worst) his role in Mr. Hoffa’s death.</p><p>“Frank Sheeran never killed a fly,” John Carlyle Berkery, an Irish mob figure in Philadelphia, was quoted as saying in a 2019 Slate article with the headline <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/08/the-irishman-scorsese-netflix-movie-true-story-lies.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Lies of the Irishman.”</a> “The only things he ever killed were countless jugs of red wine.”</p><p>Selwyn Raab, who wrote about the Mafia for The Times for more than two decades, told Slate: “I know Sheeran didn’t kill Hoffa. I’m as confident about that as you can be. There are 14 people who claim to have killed Hoffa. There’s an inexhaustible supply of them.”</p><p>Mr. Brandt defended himself in part by pointing to his past career prosecuting homicides in Delaware.</p><p>“How many actual crimes have these people ever investigated?” he said in an interview with the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph. “Have they ever investigated a shoplifting case? The answer is: No.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. De Niro <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/robert-de-niro-confronts-irishman-claim-untrue-story-1202189196/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the entertainment website IndieWire that he “wasn’t getting conned.”</p><p>“I have no problem with people disagreeing,” he added. “As Marty says, we’re not saying we’re telling the actual story, we’re telling our story. I believed it.”</p><p>Charles Peter Brandt was born on March 13, 1942, on Staten Island and lived in Queens as a teenager. His father, Charles, was a customs house broker. His mother, Carolina (DiMarco) Brandt, was a nurse.</p><p>Mr. Brandt graduated from the University of Delaware in 1963 with a degree in English, then worked his way through Brooklyn Law School as an investigator for the New York City Welfare Department in East Harlem.</p><p>“That is where I literally hung out with Mafia types,” Mr. Brandt <a href="https://www.ncbar.org/news/ncl-2020-08-the-irishman/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the magazine North Carolina Lawyer in 2020. “East Harlem is one of the principal areas, at least in those days, of the Mafia.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In “The Irishman,” Joe Pesci, left, played the mobster Russell Bufalino and Robert De Niro played Frank Sheeran, who said he had been hired by Mr. Bufalino to kill the former Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Netflix, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After graduating from law school in 1969, Mr. Brandt returned to Delaware and worked as a homicide prosecutor for the state’s attorney general. He eventually became chief deputy attorney general.</p><p>He entered private practice in 1976, specializing in medical malpractice. In 1988, he published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/28/books/in-short-fiction.html?timespastHighlight=the,right,to,remain,silent,brandt" title="">“The Right to Remain Silent,”</a> a novel about a police officer who is framed for theft.</p><p>Around the same time, Mr. Sheeran was serving a long prison sentence for racketeering when he developed serious medical problems. He hired Mr. Brandt to help him win early release — and won.</p><p>“He took me and my administrative staff to lunch with eight guys named Rocco who were his cohorts,” Mr. Brandt told North Carolina Lawyer.</p><p>Mr. Sheeran’s name had long been connected with Mr. Hoffa’s disappearance. After lunch, he took Mr. Brandt aside and asked if he would be interested in writing a book about what really happened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>They met to discuss the idea, but decided to shelve the project: It was too dangerous, they felt, since many of the characters in the story were still alive.</p><p>Some eight years later, once those figures were dead, Mr. Sheeran said he wanted to resume their conversations.</p><p>“He clearly wanted to get it off his chest,” Mr. Brandt said.</p><p>Mr. Brandt went on to write two other Mafia books: “Donnie Brasco: Unfinished Business” (2007), the story of how his co-author, the undercover F.B.I. agent Joe Pistone, infiltrated the Bonanno crime family; and “We’re Going to Win This Thing: The Shocking Frame-Up of a Mafia Crime Buster” (2012), which he wrote with the F.B.I. agent Lin DeVecchio.</p><p>His last book, “Suppressing the Truth in Dallas: Conspiracy, Cover-Up, and International Complications in the JFK Assassination Case” (2022), detailed what he said was the Mafia’s role in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. During their discussions, Mr. Sheeran had told Mr. Brandt that he delivered rifles he believed were to be used in the attack.</p><p>Mr. Brandt’s marriage in 1963 to Kathleen McGaw ended in divorce. He married Nancy Poole in 1976. She survives him, along with their daughter, Jenny Rose Brandt; his stepchildren, Tripp Wier and Mimi Royer; a sister, Barbara Goldsmith; and four grandchildren.</p><p>Mr. Sheeran died in 2003, shortly before “I Heard You Paint Houses” was published.</p><p>“When all was confessed, Frank met with a priest for absolution, and then the Irishman committed suicide by refusing food,” Mr. Brandt told Publishers Weekly. “‘I’m checking out,’ Frank told his family.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
