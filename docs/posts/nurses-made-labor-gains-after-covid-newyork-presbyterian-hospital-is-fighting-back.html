Together they confronted mass death and an unknown pathogen, <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/worker-at-nyc-hospital-where-nurses-wear-trash-bags-as-protection-dies-from-coronavirus/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sometimes donning garbage bags</a> when the protective gear ran out.</p><p>One result was an invigorated nurses’ union, which has won a series of victories for its members at hospitals across the New York City region over the past several years. Today nurses have better wages and improved working conditions. They even receive cash payouts when hospitals leave units understaffed, a benefit they won by striking last year.</p><p>But the city’s largest private hospital system is taking aim at some of those changes. It started in 2023, right after nurses at Columbia University Medical Center, the largest hospital in the NewYork-Presbyterian system, reached an agreement on a contract that included pay raises and improved workplace conditions. Just weeks later, Columbia nearly doubled what some retired nurses paid for health insurance, according to the nurses’ union. The union managed to have the new insurance rate voided through arbitration, but it has said it believes the price increase was payback for the contract.</p><p>This summer, NewYork-Presbyterian turned to the federal courts to try to reclaim some of the workplace power it lost to the nurses’ union in recent years.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Three weeks ago it filed a petition in Federal District Court in Manhattan, asking a judge to overturn an arbitration decision that awarded nurses in an understaffed unit at Columbia University Medical Center more than $270,000. The hospital said that it had made “good-faith efforts” to hire enough employees and that the nurses should receive nothing.</p><p>But the clearest sign of an “escalation” occurred in June, said Pat Kane, the executive director of the state’s largest nurses’ union, the New York State Nurses Association. That was when NewYork-Presbyterian took an unexpected step in its long-running battle to fire a particular nurse and union organizer at a Westchester County hospital. Having lost before three tribunals, the hospital system <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1279/314394/20240605162720465_23-Petition.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed an appeal</a> to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>A spokesman for NewYork-Presbyterian, Tony Chau, declined to comment. A lawyer representing the hospital system also declined to comment.</p><p>In court filings, NewYork-Presbyterian’s lawyers have argued that the judges who sided against them acted to “literally ‘play doctor’” and that the Supreme Court should make it clear that when evaluating cases involving hospital workplace issues, courts should show “a proper respect for who possesses expertise on the issues.”</p><p>Some New York City hospitals have struggled to regain their financial footing in the wake of the pandemic, as they contend with rising labor costs, battles with insurers and the end of subsidies. NewYork-Presbyterian is one of the city’s more profitable hospital systems. It had an operating profit of $112.5 million for the first quarter of this year and it has had operating margins of 3 or 4 percent in recent quarters.</p></div></div><div><div><p>NewYork-Presbyterian is also the city’s largest private hospital system, the result of a merger nearly three decades ago between two of the city’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/25/nyregion/2-more-hospitals-decide-to-merge-in-new-york-city.html" title="">oldest and most prestigious hospitals</a>: Columbia University Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medical Center, as they are called today. A decade ago, the system <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2018/12/11/nurses-claim-union-busting-ny-presbyterian/2278400002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired several smaller hospitals</a>, including Hudson Valley Hospital in Westchester County</p><p>A longtime nurse there, Rosamaria Tyo, was a key activist for the nurses’ union. But in March 2020, she was fired for crossing a clear line, according to NewYork-Presbyterian, after she walked out of an operating room while a patient was undergoing complicated spinal surgery. She was leaving to attend a union meeting.</p><p>Every tribunal that has reviewed the case has ordered the hospital to reinstate the nurse, concluding that her conduct may not have been as troubling as the hospital said. Her assignment in the operating room that day wasn’t hands-on: She was the circulating nurse, responsible for documenting and coordinating the nursing care, and supervising a trainee.</p><p>After leaving the operating room, Ms. Tyo joined a meeting with the hospital’s chief nursing officer about the union’s first contract. The meeting turned confrontational. About two weeks later, the hospital fired Ms. Tyo for “patient abandonment.”</p><p>Ms. Kane said it was unusual for a hospital to go to federal court to fight an arbitration decision on a relatively routine matter. “That Presbyterian is willing to take this all the way to the Supreme Court,” Ms. Kane said, “has a really chilling effect on the work force.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The odds of the Supreme Court taking the case are slim, but the hospital’s willingness to pursue the matter has left some nurses worried about participating in union activities — and their job security, said Renee Mauro, a nurses’ union delegate at NewYork-Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital.</p><p>“There is definitely a fear from the nurses,” she said.</p><p>In court papers, NewYork-Presbyterian has argued that the case is clear-cut. Its lawyers note that judges have long used the scenario of a nurse walking out of a surgery as a quintessential example of <a href="https://casetext.com/case/east-chicago-rehabilitation-center-v-nlrb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a fireable offense.</a></p><p>“Tyo excused herself from the operating room, without permission or coverage, leaving her orientee unsupervised, in order to attend a gathering of union representatives,” NewYork-Presbyterian’s lawyers wrote in their Supreme Court petition.</p><p>The lead surgeon in the operating room that day recommended her reinstatement, and an administrative judge who reviewed the matter concluded that Ms. Tyo had been fired because of her union activity, a decision eventually upheld by the National Labor Relations Board. The board ordered that Ms. Tyo be reinstated with back pay. Last year, a federal appeals court in New York upheld that determination.</p><p>Following the pandemic, hospitals across the region have faced increased union pressure. In 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/nyregion/resident-doctors-strike-elmhurst-hospital-nyc.html" title="">doctors went on strike</a> at a New York City hospital for the first time in more than 30 years. Nurses went on strike that year at two of the city’s largest hospitals: Mount Sinai in Manhattan and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. And at the medical college affiliated with Weill Cornell, hundreds of medical researchers voted that year to join the United Auto Workers union.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But the success of the nurses’ union over the past few years has been particularly notable. It organized nurses at Mount Sinai’s Long Island hospital, though contract negotiations have progressed slowly. Elsewhere the union has won substantial pay raises, including at the city’s public hospital system, where nurses have long been paid roughly $20,000 less than those at private hospitals. </p><p>But in Westchester, nurses say the hospital’s battle against Ms. Tyo has left a deep impression. Ms. Mauro, the union leader, says she believes the hospital wants to discourage nonunion nurses at other NewYork-Presbyterian facilities from organizing.</p><p>“My feeling is they are trying to intimidate other hospitals in the area: It won’t be easy to get a union, because we’ll fight you tooth and nail, all the way,” Ms. Mauro said.</p><p>Through a union spokeswoman, Ms. Tyo declined an interview request. She now works at another hospital outside the NewYork-Presbyterian system.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joseph Goldstein covers health care in New York for The Times, following years of criminal justice and police reporting.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joseph-goldstein">More about Joseph Goldstein</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
