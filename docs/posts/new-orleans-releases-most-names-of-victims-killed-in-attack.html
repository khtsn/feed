Many of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-attack-victims.html" title="">victims were in their teens and twenties</a>.</p><p>On Friday evening, the city released the names of 12 of the 14 victims. All had died of blunt force injuries, according to the emailed release.<span>  </span>A thirteenth victim was identified by the Metropolitan Police in London as a British citizen: Edward Pettifer, aged 31. One person had not yet been identified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial on Bourbon Street on Friday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Edmund D.

Some had just started college or new jobs. On Friday, people gathered near flowers and candles arranged along the path that the truck had taken. President Biden was planning to visit on Monday and meet with the victims’ families and others affected.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Among the victims was Drew Dauphin, 26, who had come to the city from Alabama with his little brother, Matthew. They had gotten separated after going to a concert and getting some pizza. Hubert Gauthreaux, 21, had planned to watch the fireworks along the river, he told his family. That morning they checked his phone’s location, and saw it had moved to Bourbon Street.</p><p>Matthew Tenedorio, 25, had gone out with friends after eating dinner with his parents. He was remembered for his childhood high jinks with his cousins, playing pranks and fighting with Nerf guns.</p><p>Kareem Badawi and Ni’Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux were just 18. Mr. Badawi had recently finished his first semester at the University of Alabama, where he majored in mechanical engineering, according to his father.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ni’Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jennifer Smith</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Ms. Dedeaux was from Gulfport, Miss.

Nicole Perez, 27, had just gotten a promotion at the deli where she worked. She left behind a 4-year-old son. Two cousins, Reggie Hunter, 37, and Kevin Curry, 38, came to the city to celebrate the new year together. Mr. Hunter died, and Mr. Curry was hospitalized with a broken leg.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nicole Perez</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elliott</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Tiger Bech, a former college football player who died, was remembered by his little brother, Jack, in a post on social media: “Love you always brother!”</p><p>Some victims, like Mr. Wilkinson, had longstanding ties to New Orleans. Terrence Kennedy, 63, was a lifelong resident of the city and one of nine siblings, according to one of his nieces, Monisha James. With no children of his own, he was always ready to look after family members’ kids, she said. At family parties, he kept an eye out for plates to clear and drinks to refill. </p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Terrence Kennedy</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Monisha James</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Though many locals avoid the area except to work or perform, Mr. Kennedy loved to people watch and hang out outside of a shop on Bourbon Street, Ms. James said. The family believes that is what drew him to the street on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>“He died doing something he liked to do,” she said. </p><p>Brandon Taylor, 43, was a restaurant cook and rapper. He regularly drove more than an hour from his home just south of New Orleans to see his fiancée, Heather Genusa, who lives near Baton Rouge. Ms. Genusa, 38, recalled that they talked on the phone for about six months before meeting in person in early 2023.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brandon Taylor</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Heather Genusa</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“I said once we meet, all the stars were going to align,” she said. “And they did.
