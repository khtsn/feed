And he was back in one of his favorite places, according to his brother, Cecil Wilkinson.</p><p>“That’s where he wanted to go, when he got out, so that’s where he went,” the brother said. “He loved that city.&#34;</p><p>In the early hours of New Year’s Day, a Texas man <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-attack-what-we-know.html" title="">drove a pickup</a> into the city’s French Quarter, where crowds of people had gathered along Bourbon Street to celebrate. Fourteen people were killed, and dozens more injured, including two police officers hurt during a shootout that killed the driver.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Bourbon Street’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/french-quarter-tourist-attraction.html" title="">bars, live music and crowds draw a lively but diverse mix</a> of people, including tourists, buskers and homeless people down on their luck. On a holiday night, it drew a youthful crowd. Many of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-attack-victims.html" title="">victims were in their teens and twenties</a>.</p><p>On Friday evening, the city released the names of 12 of the 14 victims. All had died of blunt force injuries, according to the emailed release.<span>  </span>A thirteenth victim was identified by the Metropolitan Police in London as a British citizen: Edward Pettifer, aged 31. One person had not yet been identified.</p><p>As their names were revealed this week, friends and families mourned the promising futures cut short. Some had just started college or new jobs. On Friday, people gathered near flowers and candles arranged along the path that the truck had taken. President Biden was planning to visit on Monday and meet with the victims’ families and others affected.</p><p>Among the victims was Drew Dauphin, 26, who had come to the city from Alabama with his little brother, Matthew. They had gotten separated after going to a concert and getting some pizza. Hubert Gauthreaux, 21, had planned to watch the fireworks along the river, he told his family. That morning they checked his phone’s location, and saw it had moved to Bourbon Street.</p><p>Matthew Tenedorio, 25, had gone out with friends after eating dinner with his parents. He was remembered for his childhood high jinks with his cousins, playing pranks and fighting with Nerf guns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Kareem Badawi and Ni’Kyra Cheyenne Dedeaux were just 18. Mr. Badawi had recently finished his first semester at the University of Alabama, where he majored in mechanical engineering, according to his father.</p><p>Ms. Dedeaux was from Gulfport, Miss. She had just graduated from high school in the spring and was enrolling in college in New Orleans with plans to become a nurse.</p><p>The violence tore apart families and friends. Nicole Perez, 27, had just gotten a promotion at the deli where she worked. She left behind a 4-year-old son. Two cousins, Reggie Hunter, 37, and Kevin Curry, 38, came to the city to celebrate the new year together. Mr. Hunter died, and Mr. Curry was hospitalized with a broken leg.</p><p>Tiger Bech, a former college football player who died, was remembered by his little brother, Jack, in a post on social media: “Love you always brother!”</p><p>Others killed, according to the city’s coroner, included William Dimaio, 25, from New Jersey; Terrence Kennedy, 63, from New Orleans; and Brandon Taylor, 43, of Harvey, La.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Cecil Wilkinson said he had hoped to introduce his daughter to Elliot, but had not yet had the chance.</p><p>“We loved each other,” he said. “We always looked out for each other when we was younger.”</p><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
