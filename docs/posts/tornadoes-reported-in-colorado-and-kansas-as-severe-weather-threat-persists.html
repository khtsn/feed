Forecasters warned of potential for “all severe hazards,” including hail larger than golf balls, strong winds and tornadoes.</p><p>The risk is spread across a broad slice of the middle of the country, but is focused on the central and southern Plains.</p><p>The outbreak of severe weather comes as the Midwest and the Northeast recover from a spate of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/weather/storms-tornadoes-missouri-kentucky.html" title="">deadly storms</a> that generated several strong tornadoes on Friday. In Missouri and Kentucky alone, tornadoes killed at least 25 people, officials said. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/weather/chicago-dust-storm.html" title="">rare dust storm</a> swept across central Illinois and into Chicago.</p><p>The severe weather is hitting at a time when the Weather Service is facing staffing shortages after the Trump administration ordered cuts. Nearly 600 people have departed through layoffs and retirements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A forecasting office in Jackson, Ky., which was directly in the line of Friday night’s tornadoes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/weather/nws-cuts-kentucky-tornado.html" title="">is one of four no longer with enough staff</a> to operate at all times.</p><p>It would have been without an overnight forecaster, said Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the union that represents Weather Service employees. But after an “all hands on deck” scramble, he said, the office stayed open and was fully staffed, issuing 11 tornado warnings.</p><p>The three other forecasting offices are in Sacramento; Hanford, Calif.; and Goodland, Kan. Four more, Mr. Fahy said, are days away from losing their overnight staffing: in Cheyenne, Wyo.; Marquette, Mich.; Pendleton, Ore.; and Fairbanks, Alaska.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-10"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-05-17-tornadosun" data-id="100000010176286" data-source-id="100000010176286"><div slug="2025-05-17-tornadosun" data-sourceid="100000010176286" id="embed-id-100000010176286">
