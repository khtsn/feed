The forecast is potentially for “all severe hazards,” including hail larger than golf balls, strong winds and tornadoes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The risk is spread across a broad slice of the middle of the country, but is focused on the central Plains into Missouri on Monday.</p><p>The outbreak of severe weather comes as the Midwest and the Northeast recover from a spate of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/weather/storms-tornadoes-missouri-kentucky.html" title="">deadly storms</a> that generated several strong tornadoes on Friday. In Missouri and Kentucky alone, tornadoes killed at least 25 people, officials said. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/weather/chicago-dust-storm.html" title="">rare dust storm</a> swept across central Illinois and into Chicago.</p><p>The severe weather is hitting at a time when the Weather Service is facing staffing shortages after the Trump administration ordered cuts. Nearly 600 people have departed through layoffs and retirements.</p><p>A forecasting office in Jackson, Ky., which was directly in the line of Friday night’s tornadoes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/weather/nws-cuts-kentucky-tornado.html" title="">is one of four no longer with enough staff</a> to operate at all times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It would have been without an overnight forecaster, said Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the union that represents Weather Service employees. But after an “all hands on deck” scramble, he said, the office stayed open and was fully staffed, issuing 11 tornado warnings.</p><p>The three other forecasting offices are in Sacramento; Hanford, Calif.; and Goodland, Kan. Four more, Mr. Fahy said, are days away from losing their overnight staffing: in Cheyenne, Wyo.; Marquette, Mich.; Pendleton, Ore.; and Fairbanks, Alaska.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-05-17-tornadosun" data-id="100000010176286" data-source-id="100000010176286"><div slug="2025-05-17-tornadosun" data-sourceid="100000010176286" id="embed-id-100000010176286">

They can also spawn powerful tornadoes.</p><p>“The highest tornado threat is going to be from central and southern Kansas into Oklahoma,” Mr. Hurley said.</p><p>The severe threat was a classic storm setup across an area notorious for tornadoes, hail and wind.</p><p>“The forecast environment for the southern Plains predicts a volatile setup that has not been seen in five to 10 years,” said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/weather/twisters-tornado-storm-chasers-real.html" title="">Sean Waugh</a>, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Severe Storms Laboratory.</p><p>The risk of tornadoes in the region will remain in place on Monday. There is expected to be some rain in the mix, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Showers and thunderstorms could produce heavy rain over parts of the southern Plains and into the middle and lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday, and they are expected to be more focused over the central Plains into Missouri and Arkansas on Monday.</p><p>By Tuesday, the storm system will shift eastward, bringing the threat of severe weather to the Midwest, Tennessee Valley and Ohio Valley.</p><p>“The biggest threat is going to be the wind and hail again, but the flash flood threat will also be there,” Mr. Hurley said. “It definitely is a May springtime pattern in the United States.”</p><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Graff is a Times reporter covering weather, wildfires and earthquakes.</p></div><div><p>Sara Ruberg covers breaking news and is a member of the 2024-25 class of <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellows</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
