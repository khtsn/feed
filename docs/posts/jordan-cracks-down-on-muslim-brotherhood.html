Supporters, as well as some scholars, argue that authoritarian states across the Middle East have targeted the group because they see Islamist political mobilization as the greatest threat to their own grip on power.</p><p>It was not immediately clear how the new ban would affect the Islamic Action Front, a political arm of the Brotherhood in Jordan, which formed a coalition that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/world/middleeast/jordan-election-muslim-brotherhood.html" title="">won 31 out of 138 seats</a> in a parliamentary election last year and made opposition to the Israeli invasion of Gaza the centerpiece of its campaign.</p><p>On Wednesday, police surrounded the headquarters of the party.</p><p>Amer Al Sabaileh, a Jordanian political analyst, called this a “pivotal moment for Jordan,” which had previously allowed elements of the Brotherhood to operate with varying degrees of freedom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood has fundamentally changed and will not return to its previous state,” he said. “By taking this clear stance, Jordan is aligning itself with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, all of which have adopted a hard-line approach to the brotherhood.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Murad Adaileh, a member of the Islamic Action Front, in 2024. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jehad Shelbak/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Murad Adaileh, a member of the Islamic Action Front, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.</p><p>Mousa Wahsh, an Islamist lawmaker, told Al Araby television channel that he did not believe the decision would affect the political party, which “operates independently&#34; from the Brotherhood.</p><p>“The group’s approach is a peaceful approach that has not changed, and anyone who deviates from this approach will not remain in the group,” he said.</p><p>The government statement on Wednesday was a rare acknowledgment of instability in Jordan, an Arab monarchy that cooperates closely with the United States on counterterrorism, receives substantial American aid and has had a longstanding peace treaty with neighboring Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>With roughly half its population made up of Palestinians, Jordan has experienced simmering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/14/world/middleeast/jordan-israel-iran-drones.html" title="">discontent</a> over the war in Gaza and broader regional fighting — particularly after Jordan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/14/world/middleeast/jordan-israel-iran-drones.html" title="">supported Israel in shooting down missiles</a> during an Iranian aerial attack last spring.</p><p>During its electoral campaign last year, the Islamic Action Front also criticized the Jordanian government’s domestic policies, seeking to capitalize on discontent over unemployment, corruption, poverty and other issues.</p><p>Ismaeel Naar<!-- --> contributed reporting from Dubai.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Nereim is the lead reporter for The Times covering the countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
