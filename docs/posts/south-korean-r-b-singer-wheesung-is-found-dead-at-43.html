He was 43.</p><p>Fire department officials found the singer, whose birth name was Choi Whee-sung, in a state of cardiac arrest in his apartment around 6:30 p.m. on Monday. An officer at Seoul Gwangjin Police Station said there was no evidence of a break-in or foul play, and that the authorities were investigating the possibility of a drug overdose.</p><p>The death is the latest in a string of tragedies to strike the country’s booming entertainment industry. Several South Korean celebrities have died including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/world/asia/south-korea-actress-dead.html" title="">Kim Sae-ron,</a> a young actress who was found dead at her home a few weeks ago. Police ruled Ms. Kim’s death a suicide.</p><p>Mr. Choi, who also went by Realslow, began his career in 2002 with the album “Like a Movie” and quickly gained critical and popular acclaim, winning several South Korean music awards in the same year. `</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He released around a dozen albums and also starred in musicals, playing iconic roles including Zorro and Elvis Presley. Mr. Choi also helped write music for some of South Korea’s most successful K-pop bands, including Twice and Super Junior.</p><p>His career suffered a setback in 2021, after he was found guilty of purchasing and using propofol, a powerful sedative that is a controlled substance in South Korea, on several occasions. He received a suspended sentence of one year in prison, avoiding jail time on the condition that he didn’t reoffend. He was also fined 60.5 million won (around $41,000), ordered to perform community service, and undergo drug treatment.</p><p>With the drug charge, Mr. Choi came under scrutiny from the media and faced harsh public criticism, with some people posting hateful comments online. In South Korea, the social standing of celebrities usually hinges on having a blemish-free reputation and blameless character.</p><p>Singers in South Korea posted tributes in honor of Wheesung on their social media accounts. “His music was a big part of my 20s,” the rapper Paloalto wrote on Instagram along with a picture of Mr. Choi’s first album cover. “Thank you for being there with me.”</p><p>Wheesung had been scheduled to perform on March 15 with the singer KCM in Daegu, a city in the country’s south.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Tajoy Entertainment, the company that managed Wheesung, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><em>If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to </em><a href="http://speakingofsuicide.com/resources" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources</em></a><em> for a list of additional resources.</em></p><p><em>In South Korea, call 109 for the health ministry’s suicide prevention hotline, or visit the Korean-language site </em><a href="https://www.129.go.kr/109" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>129.go.kr/109</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
