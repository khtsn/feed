Dr. Amos Brown was taking his usual Sunday afternoon nap in late July when a longtime congregant, Vice President Kamala Harris, called.</p><p>“Pastor, I need for you to pray for Doug, for me and for this nation,” Dr. Brown, pastor of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco, recalled her saying. “I’ve decided to run for president.”</p><p>President Biden had announced only a few hours before that he was abandoning his re-election campaign, and he endorsed Ms. Harris almost immediately.</p><p>The prayer Dr. Brown, 83, offered was drawn from a Bible verse that Ms. Harris quotes often herself: “What does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That quiet moment is a rare glimpse into the private spiritual life of Ms. Harris, whose biography embodies the multifaith, pluralistic and increasingly secular America she is bidding to lead. The daughter of a Hindu mother and a Christian father, she went on to marry a Jewish man in a ceremony that incorporated both Indian and Jewish traditions, according to <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/garchik/article/Attorney-General-Kamala-Harris-gets-hitched-5711847.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local media reports at the time</a>. The couple <a href="https://www.instagram.com/douglasemhoff/p/CpTbNwDOIzt/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affixed a mezuza</a> — a small scroll in a decorative case, signifying a Jewish home — on the door post of the vice-presidential residence in 2021, a first.</p><p>Ms. Harris is a person “who has gone through what it means to be living in a multifaith democracy in her own life,” said the Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, who heads Interfaith Alliance.</p><p>Ms. Harris has visited several churches in the final weeks of the election campaign. On Sunday, her 60th birthday, she made appearances at two in Georgia, coinciding with the campaign’s “Souls to the Polls” effort to turn out Black churchgoers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Kamala Harris stands in prayer with other congregants." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf/00nat-harris-faith-3b-vzgf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a00752c2-800a-543a-93b3-b9fc0e54e465" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris has said she grew up attending both a church and a Hindu temple.

In a poll in September by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs, 43 percent of respondents said they thought Ms. Harris was “religious,” and 35 percent said that of Trump.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This perception may not be a problem for a significant share of Ms. Harris’s base. As religious adherence declines broadly among Americans, the drop-off has been <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-democratic-partys-transformation-more-diverse-educated-and-liberal-but-less-religious/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much steeper among Democrats</a>. In 1999, about 60 percent of both Democrats and Republicans described themselves as “religious,” according to polling by Gallup. By 2023, the figure among Republicans had barely moved, but only 37 percent of Democrats described themselves that way.</p><p>Ms. Harris has said she grew up attending both a church, the Twenty-Third Avenue Church of God in Oakland, and a Hindu temple, which she has not named. In her adulthood, she has maintained ties to the Black church and its tradition of political organizing. But though she peppers her speeches and interviews with references to scripture, she rarely speaks about her faith in the personal terms that are familiar to evangelicals, nor does she go to church as often as does President Biden, a Roman Catholic who attends Mass regularly.</p><p>Her opponent, Donald J. Trump, was baptized as a Presbyterian and <a href="https://religionnews.com/2020/10/23/exclusive-trump-confirmed-a-presbyterian-now-identifies-as-non-denominational-christian/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced in 2020</a> that he identified as a nondenominational Christian, a broad category that includes many evangelicals. He has displayed little familiarity with the Bible or with basic tenets of Christian theology.</p><p>Even so Mr. Trump has portrayed himself as a defender of conservative Christians values, and has made baseless claims that Ms. Harris has presided over a “wave of anti-Christian bigotry” and wants to turn Christians into “second-class citizens.” Trump allies have also questioned her bonds to the Black church.</p><p>A spokesman for the Harris campaign did not respond to a list of detailed questions about the candidate’s faith and spiritual life. During a recent interview with the radio host Charlamagne Tha God, Ms. Harris defended herself from the charge that she hasn’t engaged enough with Black churches. She framed the attack on her as a continuation of Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj.html" title="">efforts to discredit</a> her racial identity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“They are trying to disconnect me from the people I’ve worked with — and that I am from,” she said, adding, “I grew up in the Black church.”</p><p>It is Mr. Trump, she said, whose values are out of step with the teachings of justice, mercy and kindness, a reference to Micah 6:8, the Bible verse that Dr. Brown invoked when she sought prayers for her candidacy.</p><p>“God is good,” Charlamagne said.</p><p>“Everyday, all the time,” Ms. Harris responded, a version of the common call and response heard in Black churches.</p><p>When addressing Black religious audiences, Ms. Harris sprinkles in Bible verses. She closed a recent address at a North Carolina church with a citation from Psalm 30:5 — “Though weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning” — that had the audience clapping and shouting in recognition before she finished reciting the verse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>For about 20 years, Ms. Harris has been a member of Dr. Brown’s church, a congregation established before the Civil War where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. The first connection between Dr. Brown and Ms. Harris was political, not spiritual: She was introduced to the pastor and civil rights activist by Willie Brown, the mayor of San Francisco at the time, and went on to advise the pastor on his campaign for a seat on the city’s board of supervisors in the 1990s. He won.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Brown serves as a pastor at the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco, a congregation established before the Civil War.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian C. Bates for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Although Ms. Harris left the Bay Area years ago, and has since assembled a network of faith advisers from predominantly Black churches across the country, Dr. Brown said that Third Baptist remains her spiritual home. She is not known to attend services regularly in Washington or Los Angeles, where she moved after marrying Doug Emhoff. (Dr. Brown pointed out that the evangelist Billy Graham was a member of a Southern Baptist church in Dallas for decades even though he never lived in the city.)</p><p>In an interview last week, Dr. Brown described Ms. Harris as a Christian — “a follower of Jesus of Nazareth” — whose faith was expressed primarily in action rather than in rhetoric. He offered as an example a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-prosecutor.html" title="">pilot program she initiated</a> in 2005 to reduce recidivism among young nonviolent drug offenders, which he characterized as an expression of compassion and seeing the dignity in all people.</p><p>“Her faith is an active faith, a walking faith,” he said. “She’s a doer of the word.” He contrasted that to a showier style that he dismissed as “a whole lot of hallelujah but not much do-aloojah.”</p><p>In her memoir, “The Truths We Hold,” published in 2019, Ms. Harris described her Christian faith in similar terms: “‘Faith’ is a verb,” she wrote. “I believe we must live our faith and show faith in action.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Some of Ms. Harris’s allies believe she should be more explicit on the campaign trail about her Christian ties.</p><p>“I think that she needs to continue to talk about her faith, to let the world know that she is a proud Christian, and that she is a woman who is a deep prayer warrior,” said the Rev. Dr. Kevin Johnson, the senior pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who said he and Ms. Harris met years ago in Pennsylvania.</p><p>On a visit Sunday to the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, an Atlanta-area megachurch that has hosted numerous politicians, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/07/national/four-presidents-join-mourners-at-funeral-of-coretta-scott-king.html" title="">including</a> former President George W. Bush, Ms. Harris used the parable of the Good Samaritan from the Gospel of Luke to weave together testimonies about faith, action and power.</p><p>And then, at the end of the service, the Rev. Jamal Bryant asked the congregation to turn to Ms. Harris and stretch their hands toward her. The candidate stood in the front pew, with her head bowed, her eyes closed and her hands clasped in front of her, as they prayed for her.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ruth Graham is a national reporter, based in Dallas, covering religion, faith and values for The Times.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Clyde McGrady reports on how race and identity is shaping American culture.
