Paul O’Brien and his family had flown in from Ireland to celebrate their soccer team’s Premier League title. “Everyone’s singing all day, everyone having a good time, everyone talking to one another,” Mr. O’Brien recalled.</p><p>“And then — ”</p><p>Standing along Water Street in the heart of Liverpool on Monday, Mr. O’Brien, his son and his parents suddenly found themselves being shoved, hard, by a surging crowd. Out of nowhere, a dark gray car was barreling down a street jammed with pedestrians. Had it not been for the people pushing them out of the way, Mr. O’Brien said on Tuesday, they might have been in the vehicle’s path.</p><p>“We didn’t realize until we were pushed,” Mr. O’Brien said. “And then we actually realized, ‘Oh, something went on here.’ There were people lying on the ground. But the people of Liverpool were amazing. Those people were very brave to push kids and people out of the way.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The parade for the Liverpool soccer team before the disaster.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Owen Humphreys/Press Association, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In an instant, a joyful day had turned dark. Around 6 p.m. Monday, the police said, a 53-year-old British man plowed his vehicle into the crowd, injuring 65 people, including 27 who were sent to hospitals. Two people, including a child, were seriously injured. A fire department spokesman said that four people had to be pulled from underneath the car.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At a news conference on Tuesday, the British police said that the driver of the car, a seven-seat Ford Galaxy minivan, had gained access to Water Street, which had been closed for the parade, by slipping behind an ambulance when a barrier was moved. The ambulance had been called for a member of the public who appeared to be having a heart attack.</p><p>Why the driver was not stopped was unclear, the police said. He was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit because of drugs. A spokeswoman for the Merseyside Police Department told reporters that the driver had tested positive for drugs.</p><p>Though video that spread quickly online was horrifying, the police said there were no fatalities. By Tuesday afternoon, only 11 people remained hospitalized and all were expected to make a full recovery. But the trauma of a vehicle slamming into a sea of pedestrians has deeply shaken<span>  </span>this proudly working class city on England’s northwestern coast.</p><p>Liverpool is a place long obsessed with soccer. It is home to two top-tier clubs, Liverpool and Everton), but the parade on Monday was the first time in years that fans of Liverpool F.C., many of whom come from around the world, could put their enthusiasm on full display. The last time the team won the Premier League was during Covid, when no public celebration was possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Despite the rain and a chill in the air, hundreds of thousands had turned out along the 10-mile route to honor their team.</p><p>“In the city, there were beers, chanting all the time,” said Michael Krüger, a lawyer who had flown to Liverpool with his brother, Christian, from Copenhagen. “It was wet, but the mood was good. Everywhere, no harsh words, no fighting. Everyone was just hugging each other. It was very nice.”</p><p>That cheer abruptly turned to disbelief, sadness and anger, especially for people who had been walking along Water Street and who witnessed the sudden acceleration of the car. But even for some in other parts of the city, far from the mayhem, the news offered a grim reminder of traumas past.</p><p>Liverpool has reckoned with significant tragedy over the past four decades, including the deaths of 97 soccer fans who were crushed in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/sports/soccer/hillsborough-disaster-trial.html" title="">1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster</a>. In 2021, a man detonated an explosive device outside <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/world/europe/uk-taxi-explosion-liverpool.html" title="">Liverpool Women’s Hospital</a>, killing himself and wounding a taxi driver.

They turned on the television and logged into their social media accounts.</p><p>“We watched video,” Ms. Hasted said. “It was horrendous, so upsetting, so upsetting. Just how someone could do that. How did they do that? Why?”</p><p>Paul Morley, an engineer from Cork, Ireland, had ducked into the Saddle Inn, a pub just a block or two from where the incident happened, to get out of the rain. The day had been “brilliant,” he said. Then he heard the commotion. When he walked out to the street, he could see that something bad had happened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“The medics, the ambulances were flying by,” he said. “We walked past the scene where there were people on the ground, and the paramedics and all the life saving equipment.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A police cordon near the incident on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Darren Staples/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Morley said it took some time for word about the incident to make its way through the enormous crowd of fans as they made their way back to their homes or hotels. “Then the atmosphere just kind of collapsed,” he said.</p><p>By Tuesday morning, the city was beginning to recover, but evidence of the car ramming and its aftermath was everywhere. Water Street was still roped off and closed to traffic as investigators continued to build their case.</p><p>The police said they were conducting an “extensive investigation” into the reasons behind the incident and the exact route the driver took throughout the day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill of the Merseyside Police said that the police were making extensive use of CCTV cameras across the city to try and establish the movements of the car.</p><p>“Detectives are making significant progress,” she told reporters, “as we seek to establish the full circumstances that led to this awful incident and bring the person responsible to justice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers on the closed off Water Street, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Super/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
