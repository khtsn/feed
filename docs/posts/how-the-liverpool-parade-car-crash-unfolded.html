Paul O’Brien and his family had flown in from Ireland to celebrate their soccer team’s Premier League title. “Everyone’s singing all day, everyone having a good time, everyone talking to one another,” Mr. O’Brien recalled.</p><p>“And then…”</p><p>Standing along Water Street in the heart of Liverpool on Monday, Mr. O’Brien, his son and his parents suddenly found themselves being shoved, hard, by a surging crowd. Out of nowhere, a dark-color car was barreling down a street jammed with pedestrians. Had it not been for the people pushing them out of the way, Mr. O’Brien said on Tuesday, they might have been in the car’s path.</p><p>“We didn’t realize until we were pushed,” Mr. O’Brien said. “And then we actually realized, ‘Oh, something went on here.’ There were people lying on the ground. But the people of Liverpool were amazing. Those people were very brave to push kids and people out of the way.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The parade for the Liverpool soccer team before the disaster.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Owen Humphreys/Press Association, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In an instant, the joyful day had turned dark. At around 6 p.m. on Monday, police said, a 53-year-old British man plowed his vehicle into the crowd, injuring almost 50 people, including 27 who were sent to one of several hospitals in the area. Two people, including a child, were seriously injured. A fire department spokesman said that four people had to be pulled from underneath the car.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The impact of the vehicle slamming into the sea of pedestrians quickly rippled through this proudly working class city on England’s northwestern coast.</p><p>Liverpool is a place long obsessed with soccer (it is home to two top-tier clubs, Liverpool and Everton), but the parade on Monday was the first time in years that fans of Liverpool F.C., many of whom come from around the world, could put their enthusiasm on full display. The last time the team won the Premier League was during Covid, when no public celebration was possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Despite the rain and a chill in the air, hundreds of thousands had turned out along the 10-mile route to honor their team.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“In the city, there were beers, chanting all the time,” said Michael Krüger, a lawyer who had flown to Liverpool with his brother, Christian, from Copenhagen. “It was wet, but the mood was good. Everywhere, no harsh words, no fighting. Everyone was just hugging each other. It was very nice.”</p><p>That cheer abruptly turned to disbelief, sadness and anger, especially for people who had been walking along Water Street and who witnessed the sudden acceleration of the car.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Almost 50 people were injured when the car slammed into the crowd, including 27 who were sent to one of several hospitals in the area.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Owen Humphreys/Press Association, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Even for those in other parts of the city, far from the incident, the news may have been a grim reminder of familiar feelings. The city has reckoned with significant tragedies in the past four decades, including the deaths of 97 Liverpool soccer fans crushed in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/sports/soccer/hillsborough-disaster-trial.html" title="">1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster</a>.</p><p>In 2021, a man carried an explosive device that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/world/europe/uk-taxi-explosion-liverpool.html" title="">detonated outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital</a>, killing himself and wounding a taxi driver. And last summer, a British-born man fatally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/europe/southport-stabbing-uk-suspect.html" title="">stabbed three young girls</a> at a dance studio in Southport, a small town just north of Liverpool.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Rebecca Hasted and her husband, Dave Hasted, from Basingstoke, south of London, both Liverpool F.C. fans, had enjoyed the day in the city and were back in their accommodation when they got a call from a relative. They turned on the television and logged into their social media accounts.</p><p>“We watched video,” Ms. Hasted said. “It was horrendous, so upsetting, so upsetting. Just how someone could do that. How did they do that? Why?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D. Shear is a White House correspondent for The Times.
