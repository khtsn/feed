It mandated a review of all agency forms and communications that require an employee to identify a gender to ensure that only “male” or “female” could be chosen, and to replace any references to “gender” with “sex.”</p><p>The order instructed agencies to ensure that “intimate spaces” are “designated by biological sex and not gender identity.” The directive appeared to settle the case of whether, at least in the federal government, transgender Americans can use bathrooms, locker rooms and other spaces in accordance with their gender identity — an issue that has been the subject of debate and legal challenges for several years.</p><p>According to the executive order, “gender ideology” was defined as “the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.”</p><p>The memo is the latest action the administration has taken to eradicate federal recognition of the rights of groups of Americans whom conservatives have argued infringe on the rights of others. It also fulfills Mr. Trump’s promise to restore “common sense” and halt efforts to “socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.”</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-dei-diversity-officials-orders.html" title="">the personnel office sent similar guidance related to programs that promoted diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility,</a> resulting in the mass shut down of programs and imminent layoffs of employees tasked with any work related to reducing systemic barriers to opportunity for women; Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American people; and people with disabilities.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
