QoR placed in the top eight of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1971/challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-1/mid-season-cup" target="_blank">Split 1</a>, but missed the playoffs of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2071/challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-2/regular-season" target="_blank">Split 2</a>, ending the team&#39;s chance for Ascension. After their elimination, tdawgg and XXiF opted not to re-sign with the organization for 2025.</p>

<p>TSM, after a trip to Ascension, brought in the QoR duo as they <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/423153/tsm-rebuilds-ahead-of-split-3" target="_blank">rebuilt</a> their roster for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2150/challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-3/playoffs" target="_blank">Split 3</a> of Challengers. This new roster played in two tournaments together.

<p>tdawgg has clarified that he was not dropped by TSM, but left in order to pursue an offer from a different team. No statement has been made thus far from XXiF.</p>

<p>TSM will need to re-complete their roster before <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2301/challengers-league-2025-north-america-ace-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> of Challengers 2025, starting on Jan 29.</p>

		<p>man that kinda sucks, I feel bad for both players</p>

</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4409697">
		
		
		<p>Why feel bad? Tdawgg left out of his choice and XXiF has just been average</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4410029">
		
		
		<p>crazy take. td0g was ass but xxif was their best player and was a top 5 player last year. he could definitely play for at least half of the franchised teams </p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4410192">
		
		
		<div>
			
			<p>Definitely not top 5 idk where you pulled that out of. Best on QoR you can argue but then again that team just did bad so is that really a achievement?</p>
<p>Plus its not like hes just out shooting them he would just lurk around on attack and on defense never switch his site for some reason even if the enemies were clearly avoiding him. XXiF&#39;s HS% is that of a diamond, Hes not that adaptive, He relys on others actions for him to make impact, The only thing you can praise about him is he is good at clutching which you can say about most pros anyway.</p>		</div>

			<p>he was statistically the 2nd best player of stage 2 while his shitter igl was dead last, all while they were 1-5. he was quite honestly the only one who looked like his monitor was on in that team - <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/stats/2071/challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-2?exclude=26082.26083.26084.26085.26086.26087.26088.26089.26102.26103.26104.26105.25882.25883.25884.25885.25886.25887.25888&amp;min_rounds=0&amp;agent=all" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.vlr.gg/event/stats/2071/challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-2?exclude=26082.26083.26084.26085.26086.26087.26088.26089.26102.26103.26104.26105.25882.25883.25884.25885.25886.25887.25888&amp;min_rounds=0&amp;agent=all</a>.</p>
<p>him not switching site is probably not down to him just the fact he had the shittest nepo baby igl ever, mada, bcj, reduxx, koala, verno and zander all had a worse hs % than him in stage 1, also using hs % is braindead. yes he relies on others but thats just kind of what a sentinel player has to do. his play style is a hybrid of sugyetsu and nats. his lurks are very effective and he can also win important duels in executes</p>
<p>And he plays sentinel. ofc hes going to lurk. Im not saying his stage 3 was amazing but he had an incredible year and i could name atleast 10 teams whos sentinel player is worse than him.</p>		</div>

	<div data-post-id="4411194">
		
		
		<p>I take ban over xxif but thats plug and play aspect of they had time (same amount of time as bad, so probably 2 seasons in the same system) but ban was definitely the second lowest fragger and idk if xxif would change if he was in but ban is also more flexible so i can see frost liking that in his stack of players</p>
