She added, “We don’t know the cause, which is why the investigation is essential.”</p><p>Neither the Spanish nor Portuguese government has publicly speculated on the cause of the blackout, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/power-outage-spain-portugal-france.html" title="">began</a> on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/spain-power-outage-photos.html" title="">Monday afternoon</a>, leaving hospitals running on generators, trains halted and supermarkets shut. Electricity was fully <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/power-outage-spain-portugal.html" title="">restored</a> by Tuesday morning. Parts of France were also briefly affected.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Mr. Sánchez met with National Security Council officials and then with the Council of Ministers at Moncloa Palace, the prime minister’s residence in Madrid, to discuss the outage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Pilar Alegría, a spokeswoman for the Spanish government, said at the news conference that Mr. Sánchez had set up a new committee to determine the cause and ensure that a blackout would not happen again. Portuguese officials also said the cause was still unknown.</p><p>The incident has raised questions about whether Spain and Portugal’s rapid shift to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/spain-renewable-energy-power-grid.html" title="">renewable energy</a> left them more vulnerable to outages. Ms. Aagesen, the vice president, who is also the minister overseeing Spain’s ecological transition, on Wednesday denied that the power outage had any connection to Spain’s rapid expansion in renewable energy.</p><p>The Spanish government has not ruled out a cyberattack on the transmission grid, even though Red Eléctrica, Spain’s grid operator, said there was no evidence of one.</p><p>A judge on Tuesday ordered Red Eléctrica, the intelligence service and the police to produce reports within 10 days about whether a cyberattack was behind the power outage, according to a court document. The National Cryptologic Center, which oversees cyberthreats, was also reviewing Red Eléctrica’s online systems to “ensure no hypothesis is ruled out,” Mr. Sánchez said.</p><p>There have been relatively few instances of disruption to electrical systems because of cyberattacks; these issues are more commonly caused by equipment failures, operational errors and effects of storms, according to the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/power-systems-in-transition/cyber-resilience" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Energy Agency</a> in Paris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hannah Christensen, a physics professor at the University of Oxford, said a stable supply of electricity depends on equal amounts of energy flowing in and out of the grid. It can be harder to balance flows in a system that depends on renewable sources, she said.</p><p>If there is an imbalance, automatic mechanisms will take companies offline as a precaution. “In the worst case scenario, you get these kind of cascading effects of user after user disconnecting, and then the supply is massively larger than the demand,” she said, adding that this could lead to blackouts.</p><p>After power was restored, Spain’s Interior Ministry on Tuesday downgraded many regions from the highest of three alert levels to a medium one. Madrid and the western region of Extremadura remained at the highest level on Wednesday, the ministry said, because of disagreements between local and federal officials.</p><p>In Portugal, Prime Minister Luís Montenegro said after an emergency government meeting on Tuesday that the outage was related to an abrupt increase in voltage in the Spanish electricity grid, which activated safety mechanisms that led to the blackout.</p><p>“We will calmly assess with the Spanish authorities what happened and try to design better response instruments in the future to avoid a repeat of this occurrence,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The outage is expected to be a key topic during a debate on Wednesday between Mr. Montenegro and the opposition leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, ahead of a parliamentary election on May 18. The two had originally been scheduled to debate on Monday.</p><p>Tiago Carrasco<!-- --> contributed reporting from Lisbon.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jenny Gross is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news and other topics.</p></div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
