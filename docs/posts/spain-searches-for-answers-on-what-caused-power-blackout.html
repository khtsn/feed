But a judge on Tuesday ordered Red Eléctrica, the intelligence service and the police to produce reports within 10 days about whether a cyberattack was behind the power outage, according to a court document.</p><p>Mr. Sánchez said the National Cryptologic Center, a department of the National Intelligence Center in charge of cyberthreats, was reviewing “the risks arising from this electrical emergency.”</p><p>“The computer records of Red Eléctrica and private operators are already being examined to ensure no hypothesis is ruled out,” he said at a news conference.</p><p>After power was restored, Spain’s Interior Ministry on Tuesday night deactivated most of the emergency declarations that had been instituted during the blackout, downgrading many regions from the highest of three levels to a medium one, which allows the national government to assist regional governments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Madrid and the western region of Extremadura remained at the highest level on Wednesday because they had not requested the reduction, the ministry said.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
