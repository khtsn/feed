The goal this year was to see the Wimpy Kid and Bluey float by.</p><p>As parade experts, the Wards were well prepared: they brought buckets and strong pieces of lumber, which they assembled into makeshift benches for passers-by to rest on. There were also extra hats to give anyone who was cold and oodles of hand warmers to pass out to people who needed them.</p><p>“Rain or shine, snow or whatever,” Mr. Ward said. “We are thankful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Drenched spectators squeezed together along the parade route.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Just before start time on Thursday morning, a group of star-shaped sugar cookies and human jingle bells stepped off a coach bus on Columbus Avenue and 77th Street and headed into position. Groups of people were gathered around the knees of a new Spider-Man balloon, and cheers were going up among the balloon handlers as they made ready to hit the parade route.</p><p>The original star of “Wicked,” Idina Menzel, scooted by a float sponsored by the Bronx Zoo and covered in wild animals, creating a tizzy of excitement among nearby balloon handlers. “She looked right at me,” one handler said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On the downtown platform of the No. 1 train at the 86th Street Station, the Steinberg-Luo family was headed to the kickoff just before the parade’s 8:30 a.m. start time.</p><p>They had gotten a sneak peek already: The night before, they had seen the balloons being inflated on 77th Street. And the floats.</p><p>“I saw the turkey!” Jupiter Steinberg-Luo, 4, said of Tom Turkey, the parade’s animatronic grand marshal, adding, “He’s not actually a float — he’s a big, fat robot.”</p><p>His sister, Leonie, 8, said she was bursting with excitement.
