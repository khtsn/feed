The blaze on the top floor was elevated to a five-alarm fire about an hour later, it said. As of 9 a.m., dozens of firefighters were still at the scene working to get the fire under control.</p><p>Seven people were injured, including five firefighters, the department said in an email. One person was treated at the scene but declined to be taken to a hospital.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Police Department said earlier that some people had suffered smoke inhalation injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Firefighters blasted water at the smoke and flames pouring out of the building’s upper floors and roof, according to videos posted online by <a href="https://x.com/fdny/status/1877681949352845342?s=46&amp;t=6sxk20UXtD80I4l93Eau9g" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Fire Department</a> and TV news <a href="https://pix11.com/news/morning/people-injured-in-massive-bronx-apartment-fire-fdny/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outlets</a>. Heavy winds had fueled the blaze, the department said; the flames appeared in videos to have spread to several neighboring buildings.</p><p>The cause of the fire was still being investigated, the Police Department spokeswoman said.</p><p>The Red Cross was at the scene helping residents that were displaced by the fire, said Aries Dela Cruz, a spokesman for the city’s emergency management department. A temporary shelter had been set up at the Bennington School on Adee Avenue. A Red Cross official estimated that about 50 people were inside.</p><p>Juan Cabrera and his family were among those seeking help at the Bennington School. Mr. Cabrera said that he and his family had not heard a fire alarm but had instead heard glass breaking as residents climbed out of windows. He said he had also heard people race across the hall one flight above him while others screamed “Get out!”</p><p>Mr. Cabrera, 47, said he had smelled smoke and woke up his daughter, Rose, 13. He and his wife, Aurora Tavera, grabbed their IDs, passports and cellphones, and the family left the building.</p><p>“I felt desperate,” Ms. Taverna, 32, said.</p><p>“Thank God we are still alive,” said Mr. Cabrera, who works as a school aide and custodian and has lived in the building for five years. “The material stuff you can get back, but we have our family,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p><p>Bernard Mokam<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Adams’s Inner Circle: </strong>Two New Year’s Eve photos show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/eric-adams-new-years-eve.html">how much Mayor Eric Adams’s closest allies have transformed</a> after a series of scandals plunged his administration into crisis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside New York’s Migrant Shelters: </strong>A reporter and photographer spent eight months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/nyc-migrant-shelters.html">documenting life in the city’s shelter system for migrants</a>, through the eyes of those living there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Katz’s Deli’s Legal Woes: </strong>In 2011, the Zagat guide ranked the Lower East Side institution at No. 42 on its list of the city’s 50 most popular restaurants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/nyregion/katz-deli-nyc.html">The honor would come back to bite</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Secret Weapon in the War on Rats: </strong>Katie, a 12-pound dog who’s killed nearly 500 of the pests this year, roams Brooklyn’s parks and streets in search of prey. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/katie-dog-rat-hunter.html">It’s not hard to find</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine</strong><strong>:</strong> Marina Khidekel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/marina-khidekel-hugimals.html">who founded Hugimals World</a> as an answer to her own anxiety, spends her Sundays watching “Hacks,” hanging out with other female founders and dropping in at a factory.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
