</span> 3-0 in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530935/team-liquid-vs-giantx-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-gf" target="_blank">EMEA 2025 Stage 2 grand final</a>. The win marks Liquid&#39;s first VCT EMEA title <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/219588/team-liquid-become-first-two-time-vct-emea-champions-over-fnatic" target="_blank">since 2023</a>, when Liquid became the region&#39;s first trophy holders in the partnership era. </p>

<p>Due to GIANTX&#39;s relative lack of success in the past, this match was only the teams&#39; fifth encounter in the partnership era. Team Liquid came out on top on every occasion, including a win back in the 2023 regular season, both teams&#39; most successful season in terms of silverware.</p>

<p>The match began on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530935/team-liquid-vs-giantx-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-gf/?game=231423&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, with initial dominance from GIANTX giving them a comfortable lead to start. A 4K from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4181/cloud">
		Cloud	</a>
</span> on their bonus round kept Liquid&#39;s economy in check, helping GIANTX stay on top despite a handful of rounds going the opponent&#39;s way. <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11494/keiko">
		Keiko	</a>
</span> multikills kept Liquid in the game, however, and the half ended 7-5 in GIANTX&#39;s favor. </p>

<p><em>Fresh off of a timeout, Team Liquid begins a comeback.</em></p>

<p>Team Liquid took the second pistol round to tie the map, with GIANTX taking the lead once more in the following rounds. Liquid was able to exploit GIANTX&#39;s more defensive composition, and was able to keep GIANTX out of the rest of the map with proper map control, crunches, and finding early player advantages. In the end, Team Liquid bounced back to win Bind 13-10, proving resilient against a strong round lead. </p>

<p>A chaotic <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530935/team-liquid-vs-giantx-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-gf/?game=231424&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a> followed, with various multikills and hero plays granting GIANTX the pistol round but allowing Liquid to take the lead 5-2. GIANTX stabilized soon after a half-buy win, and their Polish duo helped push GIANTX to a 7-5 halftime.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vK0SfER05jk?si=4RSyTnCuZmzhxLE7&amp;clip=Ugkxg4DMdX8vJIJu7NOma8vp7SNv0fZJChuz&amp;clipt=EPjPGxj90Bw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>Lotus was chaos throughout, with multiple individual heroics in the beginning of the map.</em></p>

<p>Liquid answered in kind on their own attack, equalizing with a pistol win and taking over the map with a six-round win streak. As with Bind, Liquid was able to win most rounds in the second half before a defuse or spike detonation, and their lead in terms of first kills kept GIANTX on the back foot for the remainder of the map. GIANTX won a couple of rounds after a 4v3 and ara clutch, but Liquid&#39;s lead proved too large to overcome, and the Kickoff finalists won the second map 13-9.</p>

<p>Now up 2-0, Team Liquid needed a win on Sunset in order to claim the crown. Liquid won their first opening pistol of the series, their fourth pistol win overall, and the teams went on to trade rounds. Ultimately, the opponents were fairly evenly matched, heading into the break with a 6-6 scoreline. </p>

</span> wins his second title of the year with a 1v1.</em></p>

<p>Team Liquid set themselves apart with a pistol win, and the team was able to find a crucial bonus round win to go up 10-4. GIANTX answered in kind, but Liquid&#39;s advantage from winning the bonus proved too much to overcome for GIANTX, with Sunset ending 13-10 and Liquid taking the series 3-0.</p>
