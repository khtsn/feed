    <h1>Team Liquid sweeps GIANTX to return to the EMEA throne</h1>

		<p>Team Liquid has defeated GIANTX 3-0 in the EMEA 2025 Stage 2 grand final. The win marks Liquid&#39;s first VCT EMEA title since 2023, when Liquid became the region&#39;s first trophy holders in the partnership era. GIANTX, on the other hand, was a newcomer to the podium, only having had success in the 2023 LCQ under their previous banner, Giants.</p>

<p>The match began on Bind, with a strong start from GIANTX thanks to their defensive composition. Team Liquid exploited this weakness on the second half, however, bouncing back to win their pick 13-10.</p>

<p>A chaotic Lotus followed, with both teams trading multikills and hero plays to start the map. Similarly to Bind, GIANTX took an early lead heading into halftime, but Team Liquid was able to mount a comeback and win 13-9.</p>

<p>Sunset was a closer affair initially, with a relative back-and-forth ending the first half 6-6. Team Liquid came out on top on their attack after winning the bonus, and the lead proved too much to handle for GIANTX, as Liquid won the third map 13-10 and the series 3-0.</p>

<p>Both teams had already qualified to Champions: Paris thanks to making it to the Stage 2 grand final, and will next feature as the top EMEA seeds in the premier event&#39;s group stage. Team Heretics and FNATIC will join the finalists, thanks to their consistency throughout the year, as Champions returns to the teams&#39; home region.</p>
