The person’s identity was not known, Chief Alvarado said in a statement.</p><p>The make and model of the vehicle were also unclear. All that was left of it at the scene was an axle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Reports of a loud boom and images of broken glass and billowing smoke began to be shared on social media around 11 a.m. local time. The blast area extended for blocks, and some buildings were severely damaged.</p><p>A phone number for the clinic, American Reproductive Centers, did not appear to be in service on Saturday.</p><p>A website for the office listed fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization and egg freezing, among its services. In a Facebook post, the clinic reported that none of its staff were harmed in the explosion and that the eggs, embryos and other materials in its lab were “fully secure and undamaged.”</p><p>“We are heavily conducting a complete safety inspection and have confirmed that our operations and sensitive medical areas were not impacted by the blast,” the clinic wrote on its Facebook page, adding that it expected to be open for normal operations on Monday.</p><p>“I really have no clue what happened,” Dr. Maher Abdallah, who runs the clinic, told <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-explosion-palm-springs-eb8887fbe5877a20a40916aba86554ea" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a>. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The police, firefighters and medical crews were on the scene, the mayor said. Gov. Gavin Newsom has been briefed on the explosion, his press office said on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>Laura Eimiller, a public affairs specialist with the F.B.I., said the agency had dispatched investigators, bomb technicians and an evidence response team to the scene.</p><p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting with the investigation, according to a spokeswoman, Nicole Lozano.</p><p>Planned Parenthood clinics in the area reported no threats of danger but closed 19 health centers across Southern California on Saturday out of an abundance of caution, a spokesperson said.</p><p>Palm Springs, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles, is known for its stunning mid-century modern architecture, arid desert landscapes and thriving L.G.B.T.Q. community. In 2017, it became the first city in the country with an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/opinion/palm-springs-gay-government.html" title="">entirely L.G.B.T.Q. city council</a>. Politically, Palm Springs is a liberal city in an otherwise more conservative region of California.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The area where the blast occurred is on the edge of neighborhoods made famous for vacation homes of Hollywood stars from the past. It sits about a mile and a half from a large sculpture of Marilyn Monroe, who was known to escape to the desert town.</p><p>It is unclear if the clinic itself was intended to be a target of the bomb. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/us/politics/ivf-policy-white-house.html" title="">in vitro fertilization has become increasingly politicized</a> in the debate over reproductive rights, while dividing social conservatives.</p><p>Many Christian conservatives who oppose abortion also oppose I.V.F. because they do not support the loss of embryos, which they consider people. Embryos are routinely discarded during I.V.F. if they fail to develop.</p><p>Prominent Republicans have repeatedly disavowed efforts to limit I.V.F. President Trump, who has declared himself the “fertilization president,” has promised to expand access to the procedure.</p><p>Still, some right-wing Christian activists have moved ahead with efforts to restrict the procedure. Last year, the Southern Baptist Convention, the country’s largest Protestant denomination, opposed the use of I.V.F. for the first time, even though the procedure is popular among evangelical families. And last year, several state Republican parties added anti-abortion language to their platforms, indicating an openness to restrictions on I.V.F.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Saturday, videos showed flames licking the shattered terra-cotta tiles of the clinic’s roof as debris clogged its entrance.</p><p>Claudio Chavez, who works at an upholstery shop near the explosion, said his store’s windows had been blown out.</p><p>“I was just in my shop waiting for clients, and all of a sudden it felt like a big explosion,” he said. “It took out our window. I just saw a bunch of smoke.”</p><p>He said people came out of homes and businesses onto the street to see what happened. Mr. Chavez, a logistics manager at the shop, said he began picking up debris and sweeping up broken glass.</p><p>Matt Spencer helped evacuate his nearby apartment complex and then noticed debris in the street that resembled remnants of a car. He said that he knew it was a car because he could see the tire rims through the flames. Pieces of the car, he said, were “blown clear across four lanes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Other parts of the car became embedded in the side of a building, he added, and all the windows in a hotel were blown out. </p><p>Scott Pastorius, 61, a construction project manager from Los Angeles, was sitting in his vacation home four blocks away from the explosion site when he heard a loud boom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man in a green uniform with a vest that says “Sheriff” in yellow walks amid the rubble near a sign that reads “Desert Regional Medical Plaza.”" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt/17xp-palm-springs-01-bmqt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/0bc13d8a-c726-5c91-bc37-0d4e7f6c1ec2" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The authorities at the scene of the explosion in Palm Springs, Calif., on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andy Abeyta/The Desert Sun</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“My initial response was earthquake, but in a split second I realized it was too intense,” he said. “The whole house rattled and then the glass in the door I saw flexing.”</p><p>Mr. Pastorius said he ran into his backyard, where he saw a plume of smoke billowing nearby.
