Campbell Barker<strong> </strong>of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued an administrative stay that stops the administration from approving applications, which it started accepting last week, while the court considers the merits of the case.</p><p>In suspending the initiative, Judge Barker<strong> </strong>said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/republican-states-undocumented-immigrants.html" title="">67-page complaint</a> filed on Friday by the coalition of states, led by Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, raised legitimate questions about the authority of the executive branch to bypass Congress and set immigration policy.</p><p>“The claims are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date,” wrote Judge Barker, who was appointed by former President Donald J. Trump.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The administration can continue to accept applications for the program, but can no longer approve them, according to the order. The suspension initially remains in place for 14 days while the parties submit arguments in the case; it could be extended.</p><p>The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal actions that Texas has spearheaded challenging federal immigration policies.</p><p>The Biden administration program, <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/keepingfamiliestogether" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called Keeping Families Together</a>, drew sharp criticism from Republicans, who have made illegal immigration a central campaign issue this election cycle. In the lawsuit, the Republican-led states said that the program amounted to an “amnesty” for immigrants who are in the country unlawfully.</p><p>The White House and the Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The program eases legalization for undocumented people who are married to Americans and have been living in the United States for more than 10 years. The potential beneficiaries have been in the country for 23 years, on average, according to the Homeland Security Department.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Even though marrying an American citizen generally provides a pathway to U.S. citizenship already, those who cross the southern border illegally are required to return to their home countries to complete the green card process. Often, families remain separated for years during the process, which discourages immigrant spouses from seeking to adjust their status.</p><p>The new program allows them to bypass that step and stay in the United States while their application is adjudicated. If approved, they are granted a form of “parole,” which shields them from deportation and allows them to receive work authorization. Once they have obtained legal permanent residency, beneficiaries become eligible, down the road, for U.S. citizenship.</p><p>The judge’s order on Monday was swiftly rebuked by immigrant advocates and others who supported the policy.</p><p>“It is bad for the economy and against human decency to prevent people who have been here working and paying taxes, often for more than 20 years, and married to U.S. citizens, from obtaining legal status more quickly,” said Rebecca Shi, the executive director of the American Business Immigration Coalition, representing 1,400 chief executives of U.S. companies.</p><p>Earlier on Monday, immigrant advocacy groups had filed a request with the court to participate in the lawsuit by bringing testimony from couples who would be harmed by a court ruling against the program.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“An order like this is an extreme measure that — by law — should only be taken in the most urgent of situations,” said Karen Tumlin, the director of the Justice Action Center, one of the groups that filed a motion to intervene.</p><p>Texas and the other 15 states in the lawsuit argued that their finances would be adversely affected because the program would allow undocumented immigrants to remain in the country.</p><p>Ms. Tumlin said Texas “has not been able to provide an iota of evidence” that it would be harmed by the policy.</p><p>“This is heartbreaking for our clients and the thousands of couples who hope to benefit from this process and be able to live without fear that their family will be separated,” she said.</p><p>The program, unveiled by President Biden in mid-June, is one of the most sweeping moves to help undocumented immigrants since Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, was enacted in 2012 to protect immigrants who came to the United States as children.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The lawsuit contends that Mr. Biden’s program is illegal and incentivizes illegal immigration, and it accuses the administration of creating the program “for blatant political purposes.” The suit was filed by Texas and Idaho, along with 14 state attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming.</p><p>When Mr. Biden introduced the program, he said he was doing so to promote family unity. The program came about two weeks after his administration implemented new asylum restrictions, and was regarded as a way to placate critics who argued that the crackdown was too severe.</p><p>In just a week, thousands of applications had poured in, according to two government officials, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the matter.</p><p>Couples seeking information and assistance with applications have been packing workshops held by legal-aid organizations and immigrant-rights organizations.</p><p>Ricardo Ocampo Hernandez, who applied last week, said that his family had been hopeful that he would be approved.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“For years, we’ve been caught in a cycle of legal challenges and financial strain, trying to navigate an immigration system that often seems designed to keep families like mine in limbo,” said Mr. Ocampo, who has been married for a decade and lives in Las Vegas.</p><p>“But with this new process, there is finally a path,” said Mr. Ocampo, 34, who arrived in the United States when he was a toddler. “When I filed my application, I felt both relief and anxiety after years of struggle.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Miriam Jordan reports from a grass roots perspective on immigrants and their impact on the demographics, society and economy of the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan">More about Miriam Jordan</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz">More about Hamed Aleaziz</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Serge F.
