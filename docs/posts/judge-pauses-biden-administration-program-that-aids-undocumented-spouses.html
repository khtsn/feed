Campbell Barker<strong> </strong>of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued an administrative stay to effectively halt the program, which started accepting applications last week, while the court considers the merits of the case.</p><p>In suspending the initiative, Judge Barker<strong> </strong>said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/republican-states-undocumented-immigrants.html" title="">67-page complaint</a> filed on Friday by the coalition of states, led by Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, raised legitimate questions about the authority of the executive branch to bypass Congress and set immigration policy.</p><p>“The claims are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date,” wrote Judge Barker, who was appointed by former President Donald J. Trump. </p></div></div><div><div><p>The administration can continue to accept applications for the program, but can no longer process them, according to the ruling. </p><p>The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal actions that Texas has spearheaded challenging federal immigration policies and powers. The program, <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/keepingfamiliestogether" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called Keeping Families Together</a>, drew sharp criticism from Republicans in an election cycle in which illegal immigration has been a central issue.</p><p>The program eased legalization for undocumented people married to Americans who have been living in the United States for more than 10 years. The beneficiaries have lived in the United States for 23 years, on average, according to the Homeland Security Department, which is running the initiative</p><p>Even though marrying an American citizen generally provides a pathway to U.S. citizenship already, those who cross the Southern border illegally are required to go back to their home countries to complete the green card process. Often, families remain separated for years to complete the process.</p><p>The new program allows them to bypass that step and to stay in the United States while they try to obtain legal status. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Miriam Jordan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Miriam Jordan reports from a grass roots perspective on immigrants and their impact on the demographics, society and economy of the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan">More about Miriam Jordan</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz">More about Hamed Aleaziz</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Serge F.
