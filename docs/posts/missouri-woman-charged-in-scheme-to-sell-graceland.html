They said she also went by other names, including Lisa Holden, Lisa Howell, Gregory Naussany, Kurt Naussany, Lisa Jeanine Sullins and Carolyn Williams.</p><p>“The defendant orchestrated a scheme to conduct a fraudulent sale of Graceland, falsely claiming that Elvis Presley’s daughter had pledged the historic landmark as collateral for a loan that she failed to repay before her death,” said Nicole M. Argentieri, the principal deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department.</p><p>If convicted, Ms. Findley faces a mandatory minimum of two years in prison for aggravated identity theft and a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for mail fraud.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Exactly who was behind the threat to sell Graceland, a popular and lucrative tourist attraction that draws <a href="https://www.graceland.com/elvis-at-graceland#:~:text=How%20many%20visitors%20come%20to,600%2C000%20visitors%20tour%20each%20year." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">600,000 visitors a year</a>, had been a mystery.</p><p>The case burst into the public eye in May, when lawyers for the actress Riley Keough, the granddaughter of Mr. Presley, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/arts/music/graceland-sale-foreclosure-riley-keough.html" title="">went to court to stop what they said was a monthslong, fraudulent scheme</a> to sell Graceland by a company known as Naussany Investments &amp; Private Lending LLC.</p><p>In court papers filed in Los Angeles in September, Naussany Investments had claimed that Elvis’s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/arts/music/lisa-marie-presley-dead.html" title="">who died in 2023</a>, had borrowed $3.8 million from the company and put Graceland up as collateral. The company subsequently scheduled a sale of Graceland to take place in May.</p><p>A Tennessee judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/arts/music/graceland-sale-elvis-riley-keough.html" title="">blocked the sale</a>. (At the hearing, no one showed up to represent the company seeking to sell Graceland.) The state’s attorney general said his office would look into the situation, but the case was later turned over to federal law enforcement.</p><p>Ms. Findley’s role <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/graceland-elvis-presley-scam-naussany-branson-missouri-rcna157155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was reported by NBC News</a> in June, in a report that identified her as Lisa Holden.</p><p>Ms. Findley could not immediately be reached for comment, and it was not immediately clear if she had a lawyer. But NBC News reported that the woman it identified as Lisa Holden said that she did not know any Naussany. When she was asked about Graceland, NBC reported that she responded, “I have no earthly idea what you’re talking about.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>All along, Naussany Investments has been scrutinized in part because it has not filed any of the records typically submitted by businesses. Someone who identified himself as the company’s representative at one point <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/arts/music/graceland-fraud-identity-thief-emails.html" title="">emailed The New York Times</a> suggesting that Naussany’s efforts were a fraud directed by a shadowy ring of identity thieves operating out of Nigeria. But the email raised a number of questions, including why it was written in Luganda, a Bantu language spoken in Uganda.</p><p>Law enforcement officials said that after the scheme attracted widespread attention, Ms. Findley apparently wrote to representatives of the Presley family, the Tennessee state court and the news media to claim falsely that the person responsible for the scheme was an identity thief in Nigeria.</p><p>Susan C.
