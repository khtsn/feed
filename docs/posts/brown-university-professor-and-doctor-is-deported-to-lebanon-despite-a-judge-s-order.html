Sorokin of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts ordered the government on Friday evening to provide the court with 48 hours’ notice before deporting Dr. Alawieh. But she was put on a flight to Paris, presumably on her way to Lebanon.</p><p>In a second order filed Sunday morning, the judge said there was reason to believe U.S. Customs and Border Protection had willfully disobeyed his previous order to give the court notice before expelling the doctor. He said he had followed “common practice in this district as it has been for years,” and ordered the federal agency to respond to what he called “serious allegations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday.</p><p>Court documents related to the case were provided to The New York Times by Clare Saunders, a member of the legal team representing Ms. Chehab, who filed petitions to prevent her cousin’s deportation, and then to request that her cousin be allowed to return to the United States.</p><p>Ms. Chehab’s petitions name several members of the Trump administration as defendants, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Peter Flores.</p><p>Thomas Brown, a lawyer representing Dr. Alawieh and her employer, Brown Medicine, said that while the doctor was in Lebanon, the U.S. Consulate issued her an H-1B visa, which allows highly skilled foreign citizens to live and work in the United States. Brown Medicine, a nonprofit medical practice, had sponsored her application for the visa.</p><p>According to Ms. Chehab’s complaint, when Dr. Alawieh landed at Boston Logan International Airport on Thursday, she was detained by Customs and Border Protection officers and held at the airport for 36 hours, for reasons that are unclear.</p><p>Ms. Saunders said in an affidavit that she went to the airport Friday and notified Customs and Border Protection officials there — before the flight to Paris was scheduled to depart — that there was a court order barring the doctor’s expulsion. She said that the officers there took no action and gave her no information until after the plane had taken off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Dr. Alawieh graduated from the American University of Beirut in 2015. Three years later, she came to the United States, where she held medical fellowships at the Ohio State University and the University of Washington, and then worked as a resident at Yale.</p><p>Before the new visa was issued, she held a J-1 visa, the type commonly used by foreign students.</p><p>There is a shortage of American doctors working in Dr. Alawieh’s area of specialty: organ transplants. The field is known for grueling, unpredictable work hours.</p><p>“It’s very disruptive to family life,” said Dr. David Weill, a former director of Stanford’s lung transplant program who is now a consultant to hospitals. Because many younger American physicians have growing concerns about work-life balance, “a lot of hospitals are turning to talented doctors from outside the U.S. to get this work done,” Dr. Weill said.</p><p>Susan C.
