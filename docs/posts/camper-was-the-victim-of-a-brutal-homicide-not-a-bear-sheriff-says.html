He was supposed to pick up a friend on the afternoon of Oct 11.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Mr. Kjersem, who lived about 35 miles north of where he was found dead, did not show up. The friend then went looking for him and found Mr. Kjersem’s body on Oct. 12, Sheriff Springer said.</p><p>“Autopsy has shown that he sustained ‘multiple chop wounds,’ which led to his death,” Capt. Nathan Kamerman, a detective with the sheriff’s office, said at the news conference. “We’re following up on leads but we have no arrests at this time.”</p><p>The authorities were alerted to the death on Oct. 12 by a caller who “indicated that the death may have been caused by a bear attack,” the sheriff’s office said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gallatincountysheriffsoffice/posts/pfbid02pSLYwK6cuvaYXozZArDHqhqyNiAEFFG1RDoVqBg2mNV7pHFt3NNqY4VZTR8fffcQl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Facebook</a>.</p><p>But there was no evidence of a bear, according to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which visited the crime scene to investigate.</p><p>“If there is a bear in the area, they leave tracks, hair, scat — that sort of thing,” Greg Lemon, the administrator for the communications and education division for the department, said in a phone interview on Friday. “We didn’t see any signs of bear activity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was not immediately clear if Mr. Kjersem’s friend was the caller. The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to questions seeking more information about the caller or the friend.</p><p>“He was a loving, helpful and adoring father who in no way deserved this,” Jillian Price, Mr. Kjersem’s sister, said at the news conference. “I ask our community to please help us find out who did this. There is someone in our valley that is capable of truly heinous things.”</p><p>The family has set up a GoFundMe to help support Mr. Kjersem’s children. Ms. Price did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment made through GoFundMe.</p><p>The authorities did not know exactly what weapon was used to kill Mr. Kjersem. But Sheriff Springer said it was “something hard enough to cause significant damage to the skull” and “some flesh areas of the body.”</p><p>Even though the woods where Kjersem was killed is “fairly remote,” it is a popular place for hunters and other campers, Sheriff Springer said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The authorities are hoping that someone may have seen Mr. Kjersem or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=873041055017223&amp;set=pcb.873042245017104" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his truck</a> — a black, 2013 Ford F-150 — and are asking the public for tips or trail camera footage.</p><p>“People have asked me if there is a threat to this community,” Sheriff Springer said. “And the answer is ‘We don’t know.’”</p><p>Bear attacks have been known to occur in Montana.</p><p>In September, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/us/bear-attack-glacier-national-park.html" title="">man was injured</a> by a bear while hiking in Glacier National Park. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/us/bear-attack-euthanized-montana.html" title="">a woman was killed</a> by a grizzly bear on a trail in Montana.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
