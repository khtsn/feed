The most conservative of those parties, the People’s Party, then entered negotiations with the Freedom Party over forming a government that would have made Herbert Kickl, the outspoken leader of the far-right party, the chancellor.</p><p>But those talks broke down as well, setting the stage for a final effort by the mainstream parties. </p><p>On Thursday, the People’s Party, the Austrian Social Democrats and the liberal NEOS party announced the deal to form a coalition and presented a 200-page plan for governing the country for the next four years.</p><p>While the main focus of the plan is on the budget and the economy, it also touches on migration reform and proposes a head-scarf ban for young girls, in a nod to the Freedom Party.</p><p>The far right has gained popularity since last fall and is now polling at nearly 35 percent. It would most likely end up the big winner if this coalition fails.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Tankersley is the Berlin bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-tankersley">More about Jim Tankersley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Christopher F.
