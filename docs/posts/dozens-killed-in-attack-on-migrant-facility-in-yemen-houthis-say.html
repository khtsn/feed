    <h1>Dozens Killed in Attack on Migrant Facility in Yemen, Houthis Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Houthis and the U.S. military have made competing claims about who was responsible for civilian deaths in recent strikes. Last week, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command said that an explosion on April 20 that killed 12 people in the Yemeni capital <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/middleeast/us-yemen-houthi-misfire.html" title="">had been caused by a misfired Houthi missile</a>, not an American strike as the Houthis had claimed.</p><p>On Monday, graphic footage broadcast by the Houthi-controlled al-Masirah news channel showed bodies scattered amid the rubble in Saada. In addition to the dozens who were killed, at least 40 migrants were injured, according to two aid officials in Yemen who spoke on the condition of anonymity while they further verified the circumstances of the attack.</p><p>Each year, tens of thousands of African migrants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/opinion/african-migration-yemen.html" title="">attempt the perilous journey</a> across the narrow strait separating the Horn of Africa from the Arabian Peninsula, hoping to reach wealthy Gulf States north of Yemen. Nearly 60,900 migrants have <a href="https://mena.iom.int/news/iom-chief-sounds-alarm-yemen-marks-decade-war-and-humanitarian-despair" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrived in Yemen</a> in 2024 alone, <a href="https://mena.iom.int/news/iom-chief-sounds-alarm-yemen-marks-decade-war-and-humanitarian-despair" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the International Organization for Migration</a>.</p><p>Over the past year, the Houthis have launched rockets and drones at Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying their actions are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The United States intensified a bombing campaign against the Houthis starting on March 15, under orders from President Trump, who has vowed to continue military operations until the Houthis no longer pose a threat.</p></div></div>
