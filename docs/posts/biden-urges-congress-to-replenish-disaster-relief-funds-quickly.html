They have also said it would take weeks to assess the longer-term needs of those in the path of the hurricane, which can be addressed after the election.</p><p>Mr. Biden challenged that assertion in the letter Friday night. He warned that although FEMA, for example, has “the resources needed for the immediate emergency response phase,” the agency “would be required to forgo longer-term recovery activities in favor of meeting urgent needs” without more funding soon.</p><p>He did not request a specific amount of money from Congress, and he did not explicitly call on members of the House and Senate to return immediately.</p><p>But the president said it would be Congress’s fault if the programs needed to help hurricane victims could not do so in the weeks ahead.</p><p>“It is critical that Congress ensures that no critical disaster programs, such as the S.B.A. disaster loan program, run out of funding during the congressional recess period,” he wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Biden administration had already been pressing Congress for additional disaster relief funds. Last summer, the president requested money after devastating fires in Maui and tornadoes in Mississippi, Iowa and Oklahoma. The administration also asked for federal funds to help rebuild the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.</p><p>Congress did not act on those requests, instead approving a short-term spending bill that extended current levels of funding until December, after the election. In the letter, Mr. Biden made it clear that he intended to press for those additional requests as well once Congress returns to Washington.</p><p>“I urge you to assist those impacted by this hurricane and every other disaster since the Congress last passed a comprehensive disaster package in 2022,” he wrote. “We must stand with these communities on their long road to recovery.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
