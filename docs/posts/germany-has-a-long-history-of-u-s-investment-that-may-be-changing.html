Thousands of German companies already have factories in the United States, accounting for 12 percent of the country’s foreign investments.</p><p>Automakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz have long had plants in the United States. In 2023, the candy maker Haribo opened its first U.S. plant in Wisconsin, after decades of importing its gummy bears.</p><p>Many German companies are now calling that strategy into question. Recent surveys indicate that German manufacturers are pulling back from investing in the United States, and those that already have a footprint there are more gloomy about their futures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry regularly polls the 6,000 German companies with U.S. factories to gauge their outlook on the economy. For years, those companies held an “above average” view, said Volker Treier, the head of foreign trade at the chamber. But since Mr. Trump announced the initial round of tariffs on April 2, sentiment has dropped.</p><p>“They have fallen against the trend,” Mr. Treier said. “Because tariffs are poison.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The automotive sector was among the German industries hit hardest by the tariffs.

Only 19 percent of companies in Germany said they were looking to invest in North America, down from 25 percent, according to a separate <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone2/de/no-index/2025/executive-and-board-programs/Deloitte-CFO-Survey-Fruehjahr-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey of 216 German financial executives</a> by the consulting firm Deloitte.</p><p>German companies also appear to be more willing to invest at home, since a new government under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/europe/germany-merz-chancellor.html" title="">Friedrich Merz was sworn in last Tuesday</a> with a mandate to reduce bureaucracy and bring down energy prices. Many are also hoping to cash in on the 500 billion euros (about $564 billion) the government plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/europe/germany-defense-climate-spending-deal.html" title="">borrow to invest</a> in infrastructure over the next 12 years.</p><p>That excitement could change in the weeks before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariffs-stocks-china.html" title="">the 90-day suspension of tariffs</a> ends in July, or if the European Union and Washington are able to reach a trade agreement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In their first call since Mr. Merz took office, the chancellor and Mr. Trump “agreed to resolve the trade disputes quickly,” Mr. Merz’s office said.</p><p>Among the German industries hardest hit by the tariffs was the automotive sector, which has had a significant presence in the United States since the mid-1990s, when BMW and Mercedes-Benz set up plants in the South. Roughly a decade later, Volkswagen followed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The power tool company Stihl has avoided some of the worst effects of Trump’s import taxes thanks to its U.S. factory in Virginia. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Leaders of the three companies have held talks in Washington, hoping to ease the tariffs.

But the company still relies on batteries and other components that are shipped to the United States from its factories in Europe and Brazil, which means that prices of some items will inevitably go up, Mr. Traub said.</p><p>“We will do everything to avoid increasing prices,” he said. “We believe that tariffs are taxes, and at the end of day, our consumers will have to pay them.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>U.S. and China Deal: </strong>The 145% <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/china-us-tariffs.html">U.S. tariff on Chinese goods will be reduced to 30 percent for 90 days,</a> while the two sides continue talks aimed at resolving their differences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stocks Surge: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/business/us-china-trade-stock-market.html">U.S. markets joined a global rally</a> after talks between American and Chinese officials signaled a de-escalation in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Democrats Focus on Small Business Struggles: </strong>The party is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/us/tariffs-democrats-small-business.html">trying to leverage local entrepreneurs’ concerns</a> to argue that President Trump’s tariffs are yet another gift to the rich and powerful at the expense of everyday Americans.</p></li><li><p>‘<strong>We’ve Got to Survive’:</strong> Randy Carr, whose family business makes embroidered patches, is always on high alert for the competition.
