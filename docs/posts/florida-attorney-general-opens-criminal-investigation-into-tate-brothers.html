Four British women who sued Andrew Tate have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/andrew-tate-brothers-us-reaction.html" title="">urged the British government</a> to request the extradition of the brothers.</p><p>Florida officials have said that the brothers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/europe/tate-brothers-romania-us.html" title="">who arrived at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport</a> in a private jet last Thursday morning, are not welcome in the state.</p><p>“Florida is not a place where you’re welcome with that type of conduct,” Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters last week. Mr. DeSantis added that he had not known about the Tates’ arrival in his state, but found out through the media. “I don’t know how it came to this,” he said. “We were not involved, we were not notified.”</p><p>Mr. Uthmeier, the attorney general, said he would use the “full force of law” against the brothers.</p><p>“These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,” Mr. Uthmeier <a href="https://x.com/FBSaunders/status/1897042809552822450" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a reporter who posted the exchange on social media</a>. “This type of behavior is viewed as atrocious, we’re not going to accept it.”</p><p>Joseph McBride, the Tate brothers’ lawyer, maintained the siblings’ innocence in a scathing statement filled with vulgarities that vilified Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Uthmeier on Tuesday. Mr. McBride called the notion that the brothers committed a crime in Florida “complete nonsense.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“What are Andrew and Tristan Tate guilty of? I’ll tell you. They are guilty of wielding massive influence over young men,” Mr. McBride said. “They are guilty of posting mean tweets.”</p><p>Andrew Tate posted on X on Tuesday expressing his “disappointment” to his more than 10 million followers on the platform. “Absolute communism. I’ve been in America for 5 days. I sat on my laptop and did a podcast,” he wrote. “Insanity. I am super disappointed in the United States.”The investigation is a step toward justice, said Dani Pinter, senior vice president at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, adding that the brothers had publicly boasted about exploiting women.</p><p>Ms. Pinter represents an American woman, identified in a U.S. court as Jane Doe. That woman spoke to Romanian authorities who were investigating the brothers for human trafficking and sexual crimes.</p><p>The brothers sued her for defamation, and said that she gave false testimony about her experience to Romanian prosecutors. She filed a countersuit in Florida against the brothers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/europe/andrew-tate-tristan-lawsuit-us.html" title="">claiming</a> that the brothers lured her to Romania with the intention to sexually exploit her.</p><p>Romanian prosecutors said in a news release that they were still pursuing criminal investigations against two British American citizens. They did not name the people, but said they had been allowed to leave Romania and had to “appear before judicial authorities whenever summoned.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The brothers are known for promoting an antagonistic, anti-feminist brand of masculinity and have denied all of the accusations against them, arguing that their wealth and outspokenness have made them targets. </p><p>Alan Feuer<!-- --> and <!-- -->Isabella Kwai<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
