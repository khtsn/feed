Maureen, Michelle, Frank: The four of us covered Clinton over the years, and now write about Harris. Clinton and Harris are approaching history pretty differently. For one thing, Clinton leaned into gender in 2016, talking about breaking the glass ceiling. And she won a big vote from women, but her percentage of the women’s vote was a little less than Barack Obama’s — and she had <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/ggpresvote.pdf?ref=quillette.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a slightly wider gender gap</a>. Maureen, how do Clinton and Harris differ in how they deal with gender?</p><p><strong>Maureen Dowd:</strong> Hillary Clinton did not lose because she was a woman. She lost because she was a Clinton. The family just had too much baggage, and scarring from the Obama dismantling of the Clinton machine in 2008. The biggest difference between Harris and Clinton is that Harris is not tangled up in the issue of gender. In 2008, Clinton’s strategist Mark Penn told her to run like a man. That didn’t work, so then in 2016 she ran a campaign focused on her gender, with Katy Perry music and Lena Dunham appearances.</p><p><strong>Healy:</strong> Her allies were talking about gender, too, like Madeleine Albright <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/opinion/madeleine-albright-my-undiplomatic-moment.html" title="">saying at a Clinton campaign event</a> that “there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.”</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> The moment when it became clear that Clinton was too wrapped around the axle on gender was in the second debate with Donald Trump in 2016, when he was lurking behind her onstage and she did not turn around and let him have it. I think she could have won the election in that moment if she had delivered a line like Ludacris’s “Move, bitch, get out the way.” But she froze, not wanting to come across as the aggressive harridan that she was caricatured as by her critics. As she later wrote in her book about the campaign, “Maybe I have overlearned the lesson of staying calm, biting my tongue.” It was a fatal overcorrection, I think.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Healy:</strong> Have you seen anything along these lines with Harris?</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> So far, Harris has not emphasized her gender, which is smart. The best template was set by Nancy Pelosi, who is comfortable in her feminine style but never leaves any doubt that she could crush you if you go against her. When she ran for speaker, she told her caucus: “Don’t vote for me because I’m a woman. And don’t vote against me because I’m a woman.”</p><p><strong>Michelle Goldberg:</strong> One advantage Harris has in terms of gender is the unconventional way she was nominated. Women have historically done better in parliamentary systems than presidential ones, perhaps because they rely less on open competition within parties, and so women aren’t punished for displaying their ambition. Harris didn’t become the nominee by taking on a man but by supporting one, and then by stepping in when the party needed her. As a result, she ascended without creating many resentments among other Democrats.</p><p>A lot of women felt sheepish about supporting Clinton because she was so demonized from both the left and the right. I’ve <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/opinion/kamala-harris-atlanta-rally.html" title="">written before that Pantsuit Nation</a>, a major pro-Hillary Facebook group, was closed to the public to protect its members from harassment. After the 2016 election, when I went to Georgia to report on the suburban women of the so-called Resistance, many told me they hadn’t even realized there were other Democrats on their block because they’d been quiet about their own politics. There’s none of that with Harris — the enthusiasm is completely unbridled.</p><p>Harris doesn’t need to lean into the historic nature of her candidacy both because it’s implicit in almost everything she does and because her fans are driving it home on social media. That said, I am wondering how many times they’re going to play Chappell Roan’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdaKBAuO8zg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Femininomenon</a>” at the convention, a banger that’s about lesbian sex but has become a sort of unofficial theme song to the campaign.</p><p><strong>Frank Bruni:</strong> Something crucial to note here is that while no people in their right minds would deny or minimize Hillary Clinton’s accomplishments on her own, she rose to political prominence in concert with — and often in service to — her husband, Bill. She was first lady before she was a senator, a secretary of state or her party’s presidential nominee. So her haters and doubters often portrayed her as someone who had hitched a ride to power on Bill’s coattails, and she knew that — that had to put a defensiveness in her. Harris married her husband, Doug Emhoff, who was not an immediate or obvious part of any political career of hers, later in life. We call him the <em>second </em>gentleman. That has a whole different feel and introduces a whole different gender dynamic.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Goldberg: </strong>I agree, and I always thought that the mode of Clinton’s ascent lessened the pathbreaking power of it. It’s pretty common, especially in less developed democracies, for the great man’s wife to take over after he’s gone, and it doesn’t usually feel like feminist progress.</p><p><strong>Bruni:</strong> That’s really smartly observed, Michelle. Hillary was navigating <em>such </em>difficult waters, because there she was with the same Yale Law degree as Bill — hell, that’s where their romance and partnership were born, at Yale Law — and the same intellectual chops, but she adapted initially to his ambition and then, instead of getting points from traditionalists for that, she was portrayed as some evil schemer, some Lady Macbeth, a favorite political caricature. No wonder she felt so frustrated and unfairly maligned so much of the time.</p><p><strong>Dowd: </strong>You guys are exactly right. Hillary always had one foot in the world of being Bill’s wife, and taking the nepo-babe benefits that came with that, and one foot in a world where, sans Bill, she could have shot to the top of her party on her own. What sank her presidential campaigns was that she came across as Queen Hillary, someone who was owed the presidency because of what she had put up with from Bill. She seemed infuriated when Barack Obama, the young prince, rose to usurp her, and later when Bernie Sanders, of all people, became a chick magnet and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/poll-sanders-makes-gains-as-womens-support-for-clinton-shifts-1455832801" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drew hordes</a> of young women voters that she thought should have been hers.</p><p>The image I had of her in both bids was of a woman impatiently tapping her pump, believing she should not have to campaign. It was clear she didn’t like retail politicking. Hillary did not follow Bill’s lead of campaigning like a demon, searching for all-night bowling alleys to haunt. She did work hard studying policy behind the scenes, but clearly was not having fun on the trail. There’s a priceless anecdote in Ben Rhodes’s book “The World As It Is” about President Obama campaigning with Hillary for the first time, stopping by a barbecue joint in Charlotte, N.C. Obama was shaking hands for 30 minutes before he realized that Hillary had slipped away moments after they arrived.</p><p><strong>Healy:</strong> Michelle, you were at the Democratic convention in 2016 and <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/07/the-democratic-national-convention-has-been-inspiring-so-why-am-i-terrified.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote about feeling</a> “sick with dread” — about how close the race was between Trump and Clinton. So how are you feeling this time around? And what’s different?</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> First, a disclosure: The company my husband works for has recently started consulting on digital stuff for the Harris/Walz campaign. That said, he also did some consulting for Clinton, and we both really wanted her to win, but I was open about having a really bad feeling at the convention, even though it mostly went very smoothly. It was just the contrast between the genuine social movement you could feel at Trump rallies and the somewhat more dutiful show of enthusiasm for Clinton.</p><p>Now the energy feels reversed. Chicago seems like it’s going to be a nonstop party. There’s just so much ebullience at the prospect of maybe finally emerging from the dystopian fog of the last eight years and having a president who reflects the party’s culture and values.</p><p><strong>Bruni:</strong> Some political clichés are tired and need to be <em>re</em>tired, but some endure because, well, there’s great wisdom in them. Here’s a wise one: In anxious times, you want to be the candidate of change. And the energy and ebullience — perfect, great word — that Michelle is talking about arise from people seeing Harris as the agent of change and her giving off that vibe. It could have gone — and could yet go — either way in this election, because Trump arguably isn’t much of a change (he was president already) and Harris isn’t pure change, either (she’s the <em>current </em>vice president). But one of them will grab the change mantle, and so far, that’s Harris.</p><p>Her whole future-pointed, we’re-not-going-back oratory and emphasis are her very smart way of seizing that mantle. And even though she’s vice president, the milestones she represents indeed make her seem like anything <em>but </em>the status quo, while Trump’s rantings make him the status no.</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> With Clinton, we knew too much. With Harris, we know too little. But that vacuum has been filled, for the moment, with dreams and possibilities. Harris has star power and that can take you a long way, even if you’re pretty contentless at the start. Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, advised Barack Obama to run early, before he had much of a record to pick apart.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Healy:</strong> Frank, you covered Clinton’s nomination speech in 2016, and you <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/28/opinion/campaign-stops/Hillary-Clinton-Convention-Day-4.html" title="">made an observation</a> that I thought really captured the puzzle and paradox of Clinton herself: that a majority of Americans viewed her as untrustworthy and dishonest, and yet — did we <em>really </em>know her at all? “Have we gotten her entirely wrong?” you asked. Today, a lot of Americans don’t really know who Harris is — yet they don’t seem especially troubled by it. So I’m wondering: How much does it matter that voters know a candidate? Or does politics come down to what voters <em>feel </em>about a candidate — and how they felt about Clinton and feel about Harris?</p><p><strong>Bruni:</strong> I think what they know is coming to matter less and less than how they feel. I think we’ve been watching that evolution for a few decades and have seen it accelerate lately. Look at the change over the past half-century in which forms of media drive the impressions that voters have of candidates: TV came to dominate and was more emotion-driven than print. Then social media joined the party — it’s even <em>more </em>emotion-driven than TV. Memes, virality — one’s a vessel and one’s a yardstick of pure emotion.</p><p>Kamala Harris over the past month has been the meme-iest (to coin a superlative) candidate I’ve ever seen, and it tells you she’s surfing a wave of emotion above all else: relief that Biden stepped aside when he was shuffling toward disaster; gratitude at having someone — Harris — who represents a generational change and other changes, too; hope. To go back to Hillary Clinton, it mattered that we seemed unable to truly know her because she had been center stage for decades — a principal character in some of the country’s most consuming melodramas — and yet much about her remained enigmatic. To many voters, I think, that suggested secrecy or aloofness. Harris has <em>not </em>been center stage for decades. Many voters are looking at her closely for the first time. She’s a surprise nominee. In that much different context, it’s OK not to feel deep knowledge of her, and having a reaction and making a decision based on emotion won’t seem — or be — reckless.</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> This is the main question for women candidates: Is she tough enough? Can she face down the Russians and terrorists? Geraldine Ferraro was a lovely woman, but it was hard to cast her as tough as the 1984 Democratic V.P. nominee when her entrance music at rallies was sometimes “Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue” and when local officials sometimes gave her wrist corsages as she went onstage and asked her if she could bake blueberry muffins. One magazine called Ferraro “America’s Bride.” Even The Times insisted on calling her “Mrs. Ferraro,” which made no sense, since that was her maiden name. (Abe Rosenthal would finally change that rule two years later and institute “Ms.,” an act that earned him flowers in the newsroom from Gloria Steinem.) An exasperated Ferraro finally told condescending Mondale aides to think of a gray-haired Southern senator when they looked at her. But Ferraro was very proud of the fact that no matter how tough it got, she never cried.</p><p>There was never a doubt with Clinton that she was tough enough, which gave her a big advantage. Everyone knew that the hawk and former “Goldwater girl” would feel quite comfortable toting around the football with the nuclear codes. But Clinton suffered from a question that most women candidates don’t face: Is she trustworthy?</p></div></div><div><div><p>We don’t know how Harris will fare on the tough question. She can be tentative and insecure behind the scenes, according to news reports, worrying about how much she should laugh or how speech lines will be mocked by Fox News. But Harris can also be steely, as she showed when she was top cop in San Francisco. She has developed a reputation for being too tough on staffers. She was tough with Biden in the second 2019 primary debate, when she accused him of supporting racially insensitive policies in the past on busing — so tough that Jill Biden objected to her being chosen as her husband’s running mate. Harris was also tough, using a don’t-screw-with-me tone of voice, when she shut down the anti-Israel protesters at Detroit’s airport recently. But as a Republican pollster once told me, candidate images form slowly and then solidify, like a rain of confetti that hits the ground and forms a pattern. Harris’s is still taking shape.</p><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> Clinton had also spent decades having every aspect of her persona, including her voice and her hairstyle, mercilessly picked apart. It didn’t help that she rose to fame at a moment of deep cultural reaction, as John Ganz shows in his great book “When the Clock Broke.” (I am, alas, old enough to remember her being lambasted for being uninterested in baking cookies.) As a result of all of this, she became extremely publicly guarded and controlled.</p><p>Harris, by contrast, is a looser, more natural political performer than Clinton ever was, especially on large stages. And where Republicans have tried to use her words against her, they’ve often fallen flat. Remember the coconut tree quote originally surfaced as Republican opposition research.</p><p>And finally, the political context has changed. Clinton couldn’t have run on abortion the way Harris is because too many voters refused to believe that reproductive rights were in danger.</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> During the Ferraro campaign, Gloria Steinem said that there was “free-floating hostility to women in power that couldn’t be overtly stated.” Clinton echoed that about her campaign. We still have sexism in America, just like we still have racism. But women candidates have to rise about that. Clinton, as first lady and as a candidate, never seemed comfortable in her skin, probably, as Michelle said, because she had been so criticized for her looks and keeping the name Rodham when she was first lady of Arkansas. But that was reflected in a lot of political and style makeovers over the years that left her public image feeling unstable. In her style and in her presentation, Harris seems more consistent and confident so far.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Bruni:</strong> We need to keep reminding ourselves that Harris is <em>one month in</em>. She was <em>plenty </em>polarizing just two months ago: To spend an hour watching Fox News was to be introduced to her as some dastardly-ditzy combo of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Madame-Defarge" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Madame Defarge</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5KASY2Utc4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phoebe Buffay</a>, but over the past month she has been placed and coddled in an entirely new ecosystem. Which will not last. Can she hold onto all this voter good will as Republicans’ attacks on her grow louder, meaner, falser? As the sheer exhaustion of this kind of campaigning kicks in? In Clinton you often sensed undercurrents of rage and resentment at her worst treatment in the public square, and no matter how just those reactions, they fed polarization.</p><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> Frank, I also go back to the fact that Clinton had been hated for decades, and was to some degree polarizing even <em>within</em> the Democratic Party. There were still Bernie dead-enders at her 2016 convention! I wrote a piece in 2016 examining the <a href="https://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/07/the_people_who_hate_hillary_clinton_the_most.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">phenomenon</a> of Hillary hatred. That just doesn’t exist with Harris. And yes, the fact that she seems fun matters a lot. It’s driving Republicans <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-donald-trump-games-attacks-attention-rcna165254" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crazy</a>.</p><p><strong>Bruni:</strong> And isn’t it fun, Michelle and Maureen, to see them — well, to see Trump — so flustered? <em>He’s</em> supposed to be the one with the fun rallies. <em>He’s</em> supposed to have the biggest crowds. He’s like Joan Crawford in “Mommie Dearest” after her movies stopped making money, in bed with cold cream on his face, seething. I pray there are no wire hangers within reach. He’d take one and use it to rip Kamala Harris’s Time<em> </em>magazine cover to shreds. <em>“</em><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-claims-continues-personal-attacks-harris/story?id=112921505" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>I’m prettier than she is!!</em></a><em>”</em></p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> That’s hilarious, Frank! Trump is, as Bill Maher has often pointed out, a whiny, jealous little word that rhymes with rich.</p><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> Part of the joy of Harris’s campaign is absolutely the joy of schadenfreude.</p><p><strong>Healy:</strong> Let’s step back and look at the big picture. How hard is it for a woman to win the presidency in America?</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Bruni:</strong> You know, Patrick, one of the most reliably recurring conversations I’ve had with smart and politically engaged friends since Barack Obama’s 2008 election is whether it showed that — in presidential politics and in terms of the awarding of lofty leadership positions — racism was less potent than sexism, or whether Obama was simply a super-talented candidate in the right place at the right time. Was the country and is the country readier to have a president of color than a woman president? There is no<em> </em>definitive way to answer this, no scientific experiment that can be constructed.</p><p>I think America <em>is </em>ready to elect a woman president, and I think a Democratic woman has as good a shot as a Republican one. I think it boils down to the strength or weakness of the opponent, the quality of the woman’s campaign, the persuasiveness of the case she makes for herself and the vision she articulates for the country. Is she at a disadvantage? Absolutely — though she’ll get some extra votes from people who rightly want to see and hear that highest glass ceiling shatter. Is that disadvantage fatal? No. Kamala Harris has a legitimate shot here.</p><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> Before Obama, I thought the first Black president would be a Republican. That should have cured me of certain misapprehensions, but until recently, I still thought the first woman president might be a Republican in the Margaret Thatcher mold. But it’s now pretty clear that the Republican Party, at least in its MAGA incarnation, is probably too sexist for a woman to prevail.</p><p>For the electorate as a whole, though, the consensus of the political science research seems to be that voters don’t <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/kamala-harris-2024-comparison-hillary-clinton-2016/679343/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discriminate</a> against female candidates — if they can make their way to becoming candidates in the first place.</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> I think a woman can be elected, but it is trickier for women, and they will have to have the right set of characteristics. I think Nikki Haley could have won if she had gotten past the slab of Donald Trump. And I think, if she had been interested and at an earlier point in her life, Nancy Pelosi would have been an amazing presidential candidate. Steel and stilettos.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Healy:</strong> Maureen, you mentioned Geraldine Ferraro earlier. You wrote a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/30/magazine/reassessing-women-s-political-role-the-lasting-impact-of-geraldine-ferraro.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" title="">terrific New York Times Magazine piece</a> in 1984 about Ferraro and the loss of the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. In the piece, you recalled the elation that women felt at the 1984 Democratic convention and wrote about their hopes that Ferraro might “unleash ‘small-f’ feminism — that flickering and apolitical sense of injustice they felt was common to all American women.” Can you say more about that elation, and what covering Ferraro’s candidacy was like?</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> I only covered it for three weeks, but what amazing weeks they were. The 1984 convention was like a champagne cocktail, with the fizzy firsts of Ferraro and Jesse Jackson. Women and Black delegates were crying on the floor. I wrote the story at that convention about how Mondale and Ferraro would have to have a kissing policy; they would have to be careful, as this pioneer male-and-female ticket, about how they touched and did the traditional abrazos, and not use phrases like “a ticket with broad appeal.” It was fun to see images we’d never seen before in a national campaign, like Ferraro’s press aide Francis O’Brien holding her purse at the edge of the stage or ironing her blouse in the hotel room.</p><p>But all that excitement died an agonizing death and then evaporated and then caused a backlash against women candidates — amid the press conferences and scrutiny of the business dealings of John Zaccaro, Ferraro’s husband. Voters, including women voters, were overwhelmingly drawn to Ronald Reagan’s masculine strength. After the race, I interviewed women across the country who had participated in our Times poll and I was shocked at their reactions to Ferraro, which were so different from my own. One woman told me: “We look at ourselves and think, ‘I couldn’t handle it, so I don’t know if she could either.’” They talked about how some women don’t want other women to succeed, how competition among women was “a basic flaw in women’s behavior.”</p><p>It was depressing. Pat Caddell, the late Democratic pollster, pronounced a harsh verdict: “We can’t afford to have a party so feminized that it has no appeal to males.” Funnily enough, all these decades later, that was the same point that the Democratic strategist James Carville made to me recently: “A suspicion of mine is that there are too many preachy females” in the party. “The message is too feminine.” And certainly we can note, in Zolan Kanno-Youngs’s brilliant stories on the subject, that some Black men have a problem voting for a Black woman.</p><p><strong>Bruni:</strong> As an obsessive consumer of political journalism, I’m always struck by questions that women candidates get — or themes in stories about them — that aren’t present or prominent in coverage of the men. How do they manage work-life balance?<em> </em>Um, why is such balance so much more crucial or elusive for a woman than for a man? If a woman is a mother, we read about how she’s finessed (or not) career and child-rearing, and there’s this note of accusation in the investigation, as if she <em>must </em>have shortchanged one or the other. Um, men are fathers: Where’s that hint of accusation regarding them?</p></div></div><div><div><p>I mean, this simply mirrors the culture and reflects certain realities of who gets stuck with what, but the way we delve into women’s home lives when they run for office is different and not equal or just. JD Vance may have done Kamala Harris a big favor in this regard: By going so “Handmaid’s Tale” with his commentary, vitriol and snark (“childless cat ladies”), he has taken any gratuitous discussion of her childlessness off the table — he has reduced it to venomous burlesque.</p><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> One underrated skill Harris has had is her ability to use these questions to her advantage. Hence the videos of her cooking, or talking about her skin-care <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cosmopolitan/video/7394953897460256042" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">routine</a>. When she engages with this stuff, it makes her seem relatable rather than pandering, which isn’t an easy feat.</p><p><strong>Healy:</strong> Campaigning has looked pretty fun for Harris; it didn’t always look like that with Clinton. She had many strengths, but it sometimes seemed like she had to labor harder than everyone else, including Trump, to have a shot at winning the presidency.</p><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> Clinton was a wonk who seemed much more comfortable diving into the weeds of white papers than riling people up at a rally. Harris, by contrast, seems to absorb energy from big crowds and reflect it back. She has, somewhat unexpectedly, demonstrated an ineffable kind of star power.</p><p><strong>Bruni:</strong> I agree with Michelle. I think Clinton saw herself as a deeply serious thinker and policy person, and the performance part of politics was a necessary evil, the messy means to her desired end. That’s not a dig; if anything, it’s a compliment. But the ritual is the ritual. The path is the path. Harris clearly enjoys the performance, at least to a point. You can see her doing what <em>Bill </em>Clinton so visibly did: drawing energy from the crowd, from the applause.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But, again, time served is a variable here. You cannot compare what Hillary Clinton went through, in terms of public scrutiny and partisan savaging, from 1992, when Bill ran successfully for the presidency, through her campaign in 2016, to what Kamala Harris has been through from, say, 2020, when she first campaigned for the presidency, to now. This may feel and look less like grueling work for Harris because she hasn’t faced fusillades for <em>decades </em>and put on armor to Clinton’s extent.</p><p><strong>Healy:</strong> Has Harris learned any lessons from Clinton, do you think?</p><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> I think Harris has learned how to handle Trump’s bullying. Maureen mentioned Trump’s stalking of Clinton on a debate stage in 2016 as a moment when she was too controlled, but she had no model for how to handle that sort of physical aggression. Harris does. Well before “weird” became Democratic shorthand for the Republican Party’s subcultural tics, she was reportedly asked what she’d do if Trump tried to menace her in the same way. She <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-trump-vance-weird-c54d506d1f533ee7aa455f7b500322c5#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> she’d turn and ask him: “Why are you being so weird?” Trump traffics in the politics of humiliation. Harris has been able to think through how to turn that against him.</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> Actually, Michelle, she did have some experience with being crowded by a male candidate. In 2000, when she was running for the Senate, Clinton had a debate with Rick Lazio. He approached her with a piece of paper, demanding that she sign a campaign finance pledge, saying: “I’m asking you to sign it. Sign it right now.” He invaded her space (as Al Gore once strangely did in a debate with George W. Bush). He seemed oddly overaggressive, and he started slipping in the polls afterward. Clinton did not put Lazio down; she offered to shake his hand and acted normal. But I think the Trump incident was out of line and bizarre, requiring more of a slap down, more along the lines of how Harris handled the anti-Israel protesters who interrupted her speech. A firm but calm back of the hand.</p><p><strong>Healy:</strong> A final question. Hillary Clinton is a co-producer this year of the Broadway musical “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/theater/suffs-review-broadway-shaina-taub.html" title="">Suffs</a>,” about the early suffragists. There is a moment in the show where a character sings this lyric: “If you have something to say, say it to my face.” At recent performances, audiences have cheered that line; <a href="https://youtu.be/VHy8p1Rw2Uo?si=wnVrUda8Uw8Va0mI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it’s a line Harris herself has used memorably</a>. That excitement for Harris at “Suffs” — it’s made me wonder: Do you think this is a bittersweet moment for Clinton? Have any of you had any sort of what-might-have-been thought where Clinton is concerned during Kamalamania?</p><p><strong>Goldberg:</strong> I’ve seen some people on social media fantasizing about the idea that Clinton is stewing watching Harris’s rise, but I don’t buy it. I think we underestimate how earnest and sincere Clinton is, and how genuinely she wants to see more women in power. And we cannot overestimate how much she despises Trump, so I think she’d relish seeing him beaten by a Black woman.</p><p><strong>Dowd:</strong> I’m sure it’s bittersweet for her. To quote a line from another Broadway show, “Hamilton,” it has been a long, painful road for women to ascend to “the room where it happens.”</p><p>Source photographs by Bridget Bennett and Michael Appleton for The New York Times.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Frank Bruni is a professor of journalism and public policy at Duke University, the author of the book “The Age of Grievance” and a contributing Opinion writer.
