Mr. Trump was in Vietnam to break ground for the golf project on Wednesday, less than a year after meeting a local building partner, Dang Thanh Tam. Inside a tent with a gold facade, Mr. Trump told guests, including the country’s prime minister, that “the Trump family is going to make you very, very proud.”</p><p>The White House said, in an emailed statement, “All of the president’s trade discussions are totally unrelated to the Trump Organization.” It argued that there are no ethical issues as the president’s family develops <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-foreign-development-tracker/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 20</a> Trump-branded properties worldwide, because the president’s sons run the businesses. President Trump’s <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Candidate-Report-Donald-J.-Trump-2024-Part-6.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial disclosure report</a>, however, shows that he still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/eric-donald-jr-trump-family-deals.html" title="">personally benefits financially</a> from most of these ventures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Eric Trump, who did not respond to interview requests, has insisted that he is just doing his job, developing properties. Vietnamese officials say that <a href="https://hanoitimes.vn/trump-organization-urged-to-consider-vietnam-as-key-business-hub.644413.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prioritizing Trump projects</a> assists the country’s economic rise.</p><p>But as the deal-making accelerates and collides with U.S. threats to free trade, the line between Trump the president and Trump the tycoon is now seen by diplomats, trade officials and corporations worldwide as so obviously blurred that governments feel more compelled than ever to favor anything Trump-related.</p><p>While other Trump deals are happening in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/trump-kushner-hotel-serbia.html" title="">Serbia</a>, Indonesia and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000010166825/3-deals-in-3-countries-on-trumps-trip.html" title="">Middle East</a>, Vietnam has become a case study for how the Trump brand wields influence and gains advantage, challenging local norms and encouraging leaders to rush approvals, to please the Trump family.</p><p>With trade negotiations intensifying, Vietnamese officials have allowed the Trump project to break ground without completing <a href="https://vnexpress.net/nui-thu-tuc-cho-go-4887539.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least a half-dozen legally required steps</a>, from securing all the land and financing to conducting environmental reviews.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of the district that will be redeveloped are worried about losing land their families have lived on for centuries.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The process usually takes two to four years.

Many worry that their livelihoods and land will soon be taken. Fifty years after the end of a brutal war with the United States, they say they fear becoming collateral damage as the new move-fast-and-defy-the-rules approach of Trumpism marches on.</p><h2 id="link-60131115">Taking Land for Villas</h2><p>In Vietnam’s communist system, all land is owned by the people and managed or leased out by the state. Most of the property for the golf project is still controlled by families with long-term rights of use. In the Khoai Chau district of Hung Yen province — where the Trump project will take up nearly four square miles along the Red River — a sense of betrayal has been rumbling.</p><p>At town-hall meetings in early April, officials told hundreds of residents that the best they could expect was about half of what their land would have sold for even before the golf project was <a href="https://kinhbaccity.vn/1752-thong-cao-bao-chi.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> in October.</p><p>Amid a chorus of outrage at one meeting, nearly everyone stormed out. Word of the offered rate spread through streets and into the fields. Opposition has hardened as farmers fear losing investments in saplings that take years to mature, and the security that the land has provided for generations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“They’re not listening to us,” Le Thi Thanh, 57, said on a recent fever-hot afternoon, squatting to graft young custard apple trees. “They just come here and impose their will.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Farmers working in a field near the groundbreaking site for the Trump development.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Vietnam’s construction approval process is supposed to begin with independent scrutiny in the public interest at the district and provincial level. In reality, as interviews and government documents show, little of that happened and planning laws have been shoved aside.</p><p>After the March 20 <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/b9bc69c5d813ce44/becd2d1d-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> from provincial officials that said the project needed special treatment, the government cut short <a href="https://datafiles.chinhphu.vn/cpp/files/vbpq/2014/08/50_xaydung.signed.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public comment</a> and <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/b58712000d7d5596/b640b43d-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">did not follow the usual rules</a> on using public funds for preliminary research, documents show. Legal experts said the project was in conflict with the province’s housing master plan. <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/75ed7fd06b2f2453/69e9ef41-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The entire complex</a>, with Trump-designed villas and 36 holes of golf in one of four development zones, would add 35,000 residents, theme parks and an urban commercial district.</p><p>On top of that, the project is planned in a riverfront area that flooded during a typhoon last year, and the province is dotted with unexploded ordnance from the Vietnam War. <a href="https://en.vietnamplus.vn/war-time-bomb-found-in-hung-yen-province-post303881.vnp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A 200-pound bomb was discovered six months ago.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Nonetheless, on May 15, just over three months after the first official filing, Vietnam’s central government ended the planning process early, to allow for investment and a groundbreaking event that would — as the letter in March had requested — align with Eric Trump’s availability and avoid “missing the window to capitalize on the support of the Donald Trump administration.”</p><p>That same day, residents rushed to the site of the groundbreaking, only to find that some construction had already begun. A black Rolls-Royce Phantom (valued at about $500,000, belonging to the Trump partner, Mr. Tam) sat near excavators, photographs showed, 100 yards from Mr. Truong’s family cemetery and families working the land.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Le Van Truong next to graves that will be cleared to make way for the Trump project.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At the groundbreaking, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh seemed sensitive to the possibility of public backlash in a country where, despite the power of a one-party state, <a href="https://fulcrum.sg/deadly-clash-brings-vietnams-land-disputes-into-the-spotlight-by-le-hong-hiep/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people are not afraid to protest</a> over being forced from where they live and work.</p><p>Raising his voice to a crowd of bankers, generals and Trump invitees in suits or shimmering stilettos, Mr. Chinh instructed the provincial authorities to ensure that those who sacrificed property would “have a new livelihood and new home better than their old ones.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>He also said the project would “receive maximum support” to “further strengthen the relationship between Vietnam and the U.S.” He promised that it would be completed in 2027.</p><p>Several lawyers and developers said that while Vietnam’s bureaucracy can be slow, the Trump project’s pace was unprecedented, illegal and unfair to other investors.</p><p>Residents said their needs were being tossed aside to please the already rich.</p><p>“They’ll have hotels, golf courses and swimming pools,” Mr. Truong said. “We’ll have nothing.”</p><h2 id="link-55301d45">The American Connection</h2><p>The first Trump project in Vietnam got its start with the previously undisclosed efforts of two former Marine Corps platoon commanders with post-combat idealism in mind.</p><p>Billy Birdzell, 45, grew up in Larchmont, N.Y.

In 2015, Mr. Lewis started Energy Capital Vietnam, which develops natural gas power projects.</p><p>In January 2024, they were at the Melia hotel in Hanoi, on a joint business trip, when Mr. Birdzell came down to breakfast and explained that he had been texting “a friend” who was interested in real estate in Vietnam.</p><p>“That was Eric,” Mr. Birdzell said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The area to be developed is some of the region’s richest farmland.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>In an interview, he would not say how they had met.
