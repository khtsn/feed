But the opposition fighters were facing some of the stiffest resistance they have encountered so far from government forces there, who are trying to block the rapidly moving rebel advance heading toward Damascus.</p><p>Syrian government forces are still stationed on the outskirts of Homs and were shelling areas newly captured by the rebels, according to a British-based war monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. There were also clashes between rebels and government forces north of the city, the Observatory said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Still, it is unclear how long Mr. al-Assad can hold onto the rapidly shrinking pocket of territory under his control, especially without the help of one of his staunchest allies, Iran. The regime in Tehran has lent robust military support that was crucial to Mr. al-Assad’s survival over the past 13 years of civil war.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But late on Friday, Iran moved to start evacuating military commanders and other personnel from Syria, according to Iranian and regional officials.</p><p>And there were few signs that another major Assad regime ally, Russia, was coming to its aid, beyond some limited airstrikes. Russia intervened in Syria’s civil war in 2015 and helped keep Mr. al-Assad in power by bombarding rebel-held areas into submission. But now it is stretched thin, with much of its air and ground force tied up in Ukraine.</p><p>Analysts said Russia sees little incentive to intervene more forcefully in Syria given the apparent ineffectiveness of Mr. al-Assad’s own forces.</p><p>“The Syrians need to be the ones defending Homs,” said Anton Mardasov, a Moscow-based military analyst focusing on the Middle East. “If they are running away, then no one will be fighting in their place.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Amid the turmoil on the ground, the State Department urged U.S. citizens to leave Syria now.</p><p>“The security situation in Syria continues to be volatile and unpredictable with active clashes between armed groups throughout the country,” said a statement from the U.S. Embassy in Damascus.</p><p>The main rebel offensive now approaching Homs is led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. It has taken major cities and large parts of four provinces since launching a surprise offensive last week out of its base in northwestern Syria.</p><p>In the southern province of Daraa — where the Syrian uprising against Mr. al-Assad’s authoritarian rule began in 2011 — a separate grouping of local rebel factions has taken control of more than 80 percent of the province after regime forces withdrew from checkpoints and military headquarters, according to the Observatory.</p><p>In the neighboring province of Sweida, local opposition groups attacked police and military checkpoints and took control of the main prison. The two rebellions in Sweida and Daraa both involved rebel groups that are separate from those in Homs.</p><p>Anton Troianovski<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
