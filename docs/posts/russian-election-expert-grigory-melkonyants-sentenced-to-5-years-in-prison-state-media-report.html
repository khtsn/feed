Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine and led a broad crackdown at home. Charged with “organizing the activities of an undesirable organization,” Mr. Melkonyants, 44, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/europe/usaid-russia-putin.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">pleaded not guilty</a> when his trial opened last September.</p><p>On Wednesday, he was convicted in a Moscow court and sentenced to five years in a prison colony, his lawyer, Mikhail Biryukov, told The New York Times. Mr. Biryukov said he planned to appeal, calling the verdict “politically motivated.”.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m not losing hope,” Mr. Melkonyants told supporters and the press in the courtroom after the verdict, the independent Russian news outlet Mediazona reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Golos, which was founded in 2000 and documented widespread election fraud, was labeled a “foreign agent” by the Russian authorities in 2013. But the charges against Mr. Melkonyants relate to the group’s past affiliation with the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations, which the Russian authorities declared “undesirable” in 2021 — making any association with it a potential crime. Golos has said it terminated its participation with the association following the decision.</p><p>The “undesirable” label has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/world/europe/national-democratic-institute-banned-russia.html" title="">used to outlaw unwanted groups, including NGOs</a> and media organizations, and crack down on dissent. But Mr. Melkonyants was apolitical, Roman Udot, a longtime colleague who lives in exile, said.</p><p>He noted that while countless civil activists fled Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Melkonyants insisted on staying put and focusing on his expertise, without taking sides.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Melkonyants in his office in Moscow in 2018.

Anger about those violations sparked the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/world/europe/tens-of-thousands-of-protesters-gather-in-moscow-russia.html" title="">biggest protests to date against Mr. Putin’s rule</a> and spurred a broader opposition movement led by the late <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/world/europe/aleksei-navalny-dead.html" title="">Aleksei A.

But it was only after the war in Ukraine started that Russia’s security services cracked down harder on the group.</p><p>Following his arrest, Mr. Melkonyants was listed as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International, which <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/11/russia-amnesty-international-recognizes-co-chair-of-election-watchdog-as-a-prisoner-of-conscience/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the election expert was being “persecuted solely for his civil activism.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
