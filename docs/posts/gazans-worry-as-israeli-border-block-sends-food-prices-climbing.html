Hours before the border closure was announced, Israel proposed a seven-week extension during which Hamas would have to release half the remaining hostages seized during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that set off the war.</p><p>The renewed aid blockade affected not just humanitarian aid, which is distributed free, but also commercial goods, and the effect on prices in the devastated enclave was almost immediate, Gazans said.

And Hamas itself denounced the Israeli move as “blackmail.”</p><p>Israeli officials have said that the government believes that the aid and goods that have entered Gaza in recent months and during the cease-fire meant there were enough supplies for several more months.</p><p>But in Israel, five nonprofit organizations filed a motion to the High Court of Justice calling for an interim order barring the government from cutting off the supply of aid to Gaza. Gisha, a human rights group leading the motion, argued that halting the provision of aid was illegal, even if, as Israel maintains, there is enough aid already there. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And even if food is available, it may now be even further out of reach for many Gazans.</p><p>“A kilogram of sugar was six shekels yesterday, but now, after Netanyahu said he will not allow anything to enter, its price has already risen to 10 shekels,” said one 30-year-old Palestinian, Amani Aata, who is from Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza.</p><p>And it is not only sugar, Ms. Aata said in a voice message on Sunday. “Everything, everything will become expensive again,” she said.</p><p>Abdulrahman Mohammed, a 35-year-old father of four from Gaza City, said that the prices of fruits and vegetables were also on the rise, with a kilogram of tomatoes surging from eight to 20 shekels.</p><p>Mr. Mohammed said that some traders and merchants were also deliberately withholding goods from the market to sell later at inflated prices, exacerbating the financial strain on Gazans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Food aid being distributed in the central Gaza Strip on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>On Monday, the Gazan Interior Ministry urged people to report price increases in markets and shops, as well as any merchants who appeared to be trying to turn the situation to their advantage.
