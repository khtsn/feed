On Monday, thousands who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/28/world/asia/refugees-afghanistan-pakistan.html" title="">have called Pakistan home for generations</a> face a deportation deadline and an uncertain, possibly dangerous future.</p><p>Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, millions of Afghans have sought refuge in neighboring Pakistan, fleeing waves of violence and instability. Over the decades, many have returned home, but conflict and political upheaval continue to send hundreds of thousands back.</p><p>The latest wave of displacement followed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/15/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-kabul-surrender.html" title="">Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan</a> in August 2021, after the collapse of Ashraf Ghani’s U.S.-backed government. They included refugees who were promised resettlement in the United States.</p><p>Many now face mandatory repatriation, with a Monday, March 31 deadline — a decision that was announced only last month, sparking widespread fear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“As a fellow Muslim nation and a neighbor, Pakistan should show compassion and grant refugees more time to prepare,” said Haji Abdullah Bukhari, a community leader in Karachi. “Uprooting their lives in just a few days is impossible. Many have spent decades here, and now they are being forced to return to a country they barely know.”</p><p>Pakistan’s ongoing deportation of Afghan refugees stems from growing frustration with the Taliban administration, which it accuses of sheltering Pakistani militants, particularly Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or T.T.P., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/asia/pakistan-terrorism.html" title="">responsible for deadly attacks inside Pakistan</a>. The Taliban deny these allegations, but tensions continue to rise.</p><p>In 2023, Pakistan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/asia/afghanistan-pakistan-deportations.html" title="">expelled hundreds of thousands of Afghans</a> — both documented and undocumented. However, most refugees awaiting resettlement in Western countries were largely spared thanks to diplomatic interventions.</p><p>Their fate, however, became increasingly uncertain in January when President Trump issued an executive order <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/world/asia/refugees-afghanistan-trump.html" title="">suspending all refugee admissions</a> to the United States. This decision left thousands of Afghans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/world/asia/pakistan-afghanistan-refugees.html" title="">stranded in Pakistan</a>.</p><p>In February, Pakistan announced its plans to repatriate Afghan nationals awaiting resettlement by March 31, along with 800,000 Pakistan-issued Afghan Citizenship Card holders and an unknown number of undocumented Afghan migrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The decision has sparked widespread unease, particularly among those most vulnerable to Taliban persecution, including former Afghan government and security officials, women’s rights activists and journalists.</p><p>“Many have told us they fear prison, torture, or even execution if Pakistan forcibly sends them back to Afghanistan,” said Moniza Kakar, a lawyer with <a href="https://x.com/JAC_Refugees/status/1906413086149378527" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Joint Action Committee for Refugees</a>, a Pakistani civil society network that advocates for international intervention and support to safeguard lives.</p><p><a href="https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/save_60_lives_loc_nd/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Avaaz</a>, a global campaign working to secure humanitarian visas for a group of 60 Afghan women’s rights activists stuck in Pakistan, has also voiced deep concern over the deportation drive.</p><p>Among those affected is Samia Hamza, a women’s rights activist and former law and international relations student under the U.S.-funded <a href="https://www.ustranscom.mil/mov/denton.cfm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Denton Program</a>. After the Taliban seized power, she protested against the ban on girls’ education, further endangering herself.</p><p>As conditions worsened in late 2021, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/world/asia/pakistan-afghanistan-refugees.html" title="">fled to Pakistan</a>. However, she has since faced severe discrimination and economic hardship while awaiting U.S. resettlement through the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">special immigration visas for Afghans</a> program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Like many Afghans, she was devastated by the Trump administration’s decision to halt new immigrants. “We have heard nothing about our case since then,” said Hamza, who lives with her husband and four children in Islamabad. “With the threat of deportation, returning to Afghanistan means facing grave danger.”</p><p>The Pakistani government has ruled out extending the deportation deadline despite appeals from <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/03/opaque-illegal-foreigners-repatriation-plan-targeting-afghan-refugees-must-be-withdrawn/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">international organizations</a> and the Taliban administration. Justifying its crackdown on Afghans, the government has drawn parallels to ongoing deportation efforts in the United States and various European countries.</p><p>Meanwhile, Philippa Candler, the Pakistan representative the U.N. refugee agency,<span>  </span>urged Pakistan and Afghanistan to ensure voluntary, safe returns. “Forced returns help no one and aren’t sustainable — many deported in 2023 have already returned.”</p><p>Many Afghans remember <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/world/asia/pakistan-afghanistan-deportations.html" title="">terrifying scenes of the 2023 expulsions</a>, dreading the moment when police contingents might arrive — knocking on doors, rounding up families into trucks and transferring them to detention centers before forcing them into Afghanistan.</p><p>“We are all praying for a miracle that Pakistan will stop the deportations to a country my children have never seen,” said Naik Bakht, an Afghan refugee who arrived in Karachi in 1996. A father of three, all born in Pakistan, he said he fears for their future.</p><p>“I am terrified. What will we do in Afghanistan? Where will we go? How will we survive?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>March 31, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the holiday being celebrated by Afghan refugees.
