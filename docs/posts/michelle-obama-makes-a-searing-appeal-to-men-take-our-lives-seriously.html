Wade in federal law.</p><p>Those protections, Mrs. Obama said, went far beyond the right to an abortion, extending to the private and vital relationships women and girls have with their doctors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mrs. Obama’s message was, in part, a counterpoint to the argument her husband, former President Barack Obama, made to Black men earlier this month, when he sternly suggested that sexism might be preventing them from voting for a woman. Perhaps, Mrs. Obama seemed to say, men could instead be persuaded to vote for the women in their lives.</p><p>“I am asking you all, from the core of my being, to take our lives seriously,” she said</p><p>With the election 10 days away, Ms. Harris is facing an electorate deeply divided by gender. A majority of women support her. A majority of men are backing Mr. Trump. Her joint appearance with Mrs. Obama in Michigan seemed designed both to energize her female supporters and jolt men into understanding what she believes is at risk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Polls in the state, which she almost certainly must win to capture the White House, show a race that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-michigan.html" title="">essentially tied</a>, as in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/presidential-election-swing-states.html" title="">the other battleground states</a> and the nation at large. President Biden won Michigan in 2020 with strong support from its Black voters, as well as Arab Americans and Muslims. But Ms. Harris is not polling as well with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/harris-black-voters-trump.html" title="">Black voters</a>, especially men, and many Arab Americans and Muslims say they will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/michigan-harris-arab-muslim-jewish-voters.html" title="">not vote for her</a> because of the Biden administration’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza. (At one point on Saturday, Ms. Harris was interrupted by a man in the crowd shouting “No more Gaza war.”)</p><p>The Harris campaign has tried to draw the backing of other voting blocs, particularly moderate suburban women who have expressed dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump. Kalamazoo County, where she and Mrs. Obama spoke on Saturday, is a predominantly white slice of southwestern Michigan, home to many voters who chose former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina over Mr. Trump in the state’s Republican primary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President Kamala Harris smiled as she took the stage in Kalamazoo, Mich.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elconin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On Saturday, speaking after Mrs. Obama, Ms. Harris made what has become her standard political pitch in reaching across the aisle to women concerned about abortion rights and their safety.</p><p>“We’re seeing women scrambling across state lines to get the care they need,” Ms. Harris said. “Do you think Donald Trump is thinking about the consequences for the millions of women who will be living in medical deserts?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mrs. Obama had made those stakes plain, in terms that are almost never raised in the spotlight of a national campaign.</p><p>“I want the men in the arena to bear with me on this, because there’s more at stake than just protecting a woman’s choice to give birth,” she said. “Sadly, we as women and girls have not been socialized to talk openly about our reproductive health. We’ve been taught instead to feel shame and to hide how our bodies work.”</p><p>Young girls might not know what to expect from puberty. Women “my age,” she noted, don’t know what to expect from menopause. Now, they face the erosion of their health care options, she said, in the wake of Dobbs, the Supreme Court’s ruling on abortion.</p><p>“Look, a woman’s body is complicated business, y’all,” Mrs. Obama said, to laughter. As she spoke, there were nods of agreement, incantations of “Yes,” from around the room.</p><p>“And in those terrifying moments when something goes wrong — which will happen at some point to the vast majority of women in this country — let me tell you, it feels like the floor falls out from under us,” she said. “In those moments, all we have to rely on is our medical system, in those dark moments, all we have to rely on is our faith in a higher power and the experience of doctors to get us the care we need in a timely manner.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“And look, I don’t expect any man to fully grasp how vulnerable this makes us feel, to understand the complexities of our reproductive health experiences,” she said.</p><p>Mrs. Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August but has not campaigned for Ms. Harris since. She has long expressed her dislike of the campaign trail, including on Saturday, when she said,“Y’all know I hate politics.”</p><p>But she remains one of the most popular and unifying figures in the Democratic Party.</p><p>In many ways, her joint appearance with Ms. Harris represented exactly the kind of generational and cultural change that the vice president has sought to emphasize in her breakneck campaign to defeat Mr. Trump.</p><p>After Ms. Harris finished speaking, Mrs. Obama strode back onstage. As the crowd watched, the nation’s first Black first lady tightly embraced its first Black vice president.</p><p>Erica L.
