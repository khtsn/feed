Mr. Trump was not simply using the power of his office to forge an agreement — something that presidents have done for centuries. In this case, Mr. Trump was pushing a merger that relates to his own family’s financial interest.</p><p>The Trump family is a LIV Golf business partner. The family has repeatedly hosted LIV tournaments at its golf venues, including one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/liv-golf-tournament-trump-doral-resort.html" title="">planned in April</a> at the Trump National Doral in Miami for the fourth year in a row.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In other words, according to half a dozen former Justice Department prosecutors and government ethics lawyers, Mr. Trump’s participation in this discussion was a brazen conflict of interest — one of a series that have played out over the past few weeks, with a frequency unlike any presidency in modern times, even in the first Trump term.</p><p>Mr. Trump has re-entered the White House with a massively expanded portfolio of business interests, some of which require government approval or regulation, others of which are publicly traded, and still others involving foreign deals.</p><p>Presidents are not subject to the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/208" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conflict of interest laws</a> that regulate the rest of the government, but the recent actions underscore how emboldened Mr. Trump feels in his second term. It demonstrates his confidence that the lines dividing various Trump interests, and his desire to reward friends and punish perceived enemies, won’t trigger congressional oversight in a political ecosystem that he helped change.</p><p>“None of this is very surprising unfortunately,” said Hui Chen, a former federal prosecutor and corporate lawyer who later became a Justice Department adviser on fraud cases. “The entire force and power of the United States government is now part of the business support structure for the Trump family.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Even some local matters that involve the president’s businesses require government approval. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/us/politics/justice-department-trump-eric-adams.html" title="">crisis that unfolded at the Justice Department</a> in the past week over an action in New York has fueled concerns about the department’s independence and Mr. Trump’s myriad conflicts in issues involving the city.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Eric Adams of New York oversees a vast bureaucracy in the city where Mr. Trump’s private company has a number of properties.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last week, the Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/nyregion/eric-adams-drop-charges-sdny.html" title="">Justice Department directed federal prosecutors in Manhattan to dismiss charges</a> against Mayor Eric Adams of New York. Mr. Trump has said he did not ask for the dismissal, but Mr. Adams oversees a vast bureaucracy in the city where Mr. Trump’s private company has a number of properties, and the mayor has made a concerted effort to forge a relationship with the president.</p><h2 id="link-301a5a74">‘He Will Not Allow Conflicts’</h2><p>Mr. Trump in comments, social media posts and interviews, has rejected any suggestions that he is violating ethics standards and has accused those criticizing his actions as political partisans. Mr. Trump and his advisers have described the country as being in a state of existential decline as the president begins his second term.</p><p>“He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/us/politics/trump-saves-country-quote.html" title="">he wrote Saturday</a> on his social media site.</p><p>That assertion — an apparent repurposing of a quote of unknown sourcing but attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte — is expressly counter to the founding fathers’ vision of a government based on checks and balances among executive, legislative and judicial branches, in which no one branch holds too much power.</p><p>The democratic system in United States never really anticipated what is happening in the Trump administration, said Alan Rozenshtein, a former Justice Department national security lawyer who is now a law professor at the University of Minnesota.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The presidency <a href="https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/faculty_articles/1050/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">requires virtue</a> — it requires a basic level of decency and loyalty to the country,” Mr. Rozenshtein said. “If you don’t have that kind of person, there is not much one can do unfortunately at that point, especially if Congress is supine.”</p><p> .</p><p>Mr. Trump’s allies point to ethical quagmires that President Bill Clinton and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. faced during their time in office, including Mr. Biden’s son Hunter’s convictions and eventual pardon by his father.</p><p>Still, Mr. Trump’s business ventures have created a climate for potential conflicts unlike any other U.S. president. And the list of matters sparking controversy in the second Trump administration is extensive.</p><p>Not long before Mr. Trump took office, his family started to sell its own cryptocurrency token — earning along with its partners <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/trump-crypto-memecoin.html" title="">an estimated $100 million in transaction fees</a> — just as Mr. Trump was preparing to sign an executive order directing his administration to draft new cryptocurrency regulations easing oversight of the industry.</p><p>Mr. Trump has separately tasked Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, to oversee a structure approving specific hires for agencies, even though some of those are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html" title="">investigating Mr. Musk’s companies</a> or cumulatively paying them billions of dollars a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A SpaceX launch site near Boca Chica Beach in Cameron County, Texas.

Mr. Trump announced on Monday that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington.html" title="">he will nominate</a> Mr. Martin to take the post permanently, saying he had a long history of public service — “always with the same goal, of serving his community, and creating a brighter future for all.”</p><p>In a statement, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said: “President Trump is the chief executive of the executive branch and reserves the right to fire anyone he wants.” Of concerns about Mr. Musk’s conflicts of interest, she said that Mr. Trump “has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts.” She did not address questions about deals connected to the Trump family.</p><p>Nonetheless, each of these actions violates traditional norms of ethics in government, according to these former prosecutors and ethics lawyers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-2357f082">Dismantled Safeguards</h2><p>What makes the situation most worrisome, these lawyers said, is that so much of the system erected since the Watergate era to monitor and punish individuals involved in ethics violations has rapidly been dismantled since Mr. Trump’s inauguration.</p><p>“They are taking a wrecking ball to organizations across the executive branch that play a role in integrity, oversight and accountability,” said David Huitema, who was confirmed by the Senate as the new head of Office of Government Ethics in <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00262.htm#position" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">November for a five-year term</a>, but then fired by Mr. Trump this month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David Huitema was confirmed by the Senate as the new head of Office of Government Ethics in November for a five-year term, but then fired by Mr. Trump this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump not only fired nearly 20 inspectors general who investigate waste, fraud and abuse, he also fired the head of the Office of Special Counsel, who examines public corruption, and the head of the Office of Government Ethics, which provides guidance to agencies across the government on what is right and wrong.
