He was freed from federal prison in Colorado last week, not long after Mr. Trump issued a sweeping grant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6.html" title="">of clemency</a> to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the storming of the Capitol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The man’s release took place despite the fact that the district attorney’s office had sent prison officials a copy of the open warrant for Mr. Taake’s arrest in Harris County five days before his pardon was issued.</p><p>Sean Teare, the district attorney, said in a statement that his office was currently searching for Mr. Taake to make him face the charges of solicitation of a minor.</p><p>“Rearresting individuals, like Taake, who were released with pending state warrants, will require significant resources,” the statement said. “Know that we are already in the process of tracking Taake down, as he must answer” for the 2016 charges.</p><p>Mr. Taake was not the only pardoned Jan. 6 defendant who was released from custody by Mr. Trump and then drew scrutiny for other crimes.</p><p>A Florida man, Daniel Ball, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/florida-man-jan-6-arrested-weapons.html" title="">was arrested last week</a> on charges of illegally possessing a firearm as a felon. He had just been pardoned and released from jail in Washington on Jan. 6-related charges, including hurling an explosive device at officers protecting an entrance at the lower west terrace of the Capitol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>An indictment in Florida said that the weapon that Mr. Ball had illegally possessed was seized during a search of his home in May 2023 while he was being investigated in his Jan. 6 case.</p><p>In other riot cases, however, Mr. Trump’s clemency proclamation has created a measure of confusion. Judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers have struggled to determine whether the clemency covered only crimes related directly to the Capitol attack or whether the clemency also extended to crimes emerging from the inquiry into Jan. 6.</p><p>The proclamation said that pardons and sentence reductions were merited for people convicted of crimes “related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.”</p><p>On Tuesday, for example, federal prosecutors agreed to drop their efforts to detain Guy Wesley Reffitt — a Jan. 6 defendant who had already been pardoned for crimes related to the Capitol attack — on separate gun charges in Texas. Mr. Reffitt was convicted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/us/politics/guy-reffitt-jan-6-trial.html" title="">at the first trial</a> arising from Jan. 6 of helping to lead the pro-Trump mob in its attack on the Capitol, and he was subsequently charged with illegally possessing an unregistered suppressor.</p><p>Late last week, federal officials sought to send another pardoned rioter, Daniel Wilson, back to prison, saying that even though Mr. Trump had granted him clemency on the conspiracy charges arising from the Capitol attack, Mr. Wilson had been found guilty in Kentucky on separate firearms offenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>His lawyers argued that he should not have to return to prison immediately since the firearms charges arose from evidence seized in a search of his home on a warrant issued in connection with the Capitol attack.</p><p>On Tuesday, the judge overseeing the case of Mr. Wilson in Washington agreed that he could remain free until the issue of whether Mr. Trump’s pardons covered the firearms offense was resolved.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
