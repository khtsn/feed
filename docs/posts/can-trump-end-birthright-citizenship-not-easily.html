Trump has revived talk of abolishing birthright citizenship — the guarantee, rooted in common law and enshrined in the Constitution for more than 150 years, that anyone born in the United States is automatically an American citizen.</p><p>“We’re going to have to get it changed,” Mr. Trump said in a televised interview on Sunday. “We’ll maybe have to go back to the people. But we have to end it.”</p><p>Mr. Trump was vague in the interview about how he intended to proceed once he takes office. He raised the issue during his first term in office but did not take significant action then.</p><p>Here is what you need to know about birthright citizenship and whether the president could put an end to it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-6ba91cee">Does the Constitution guarantee birthright citizenship?</h2><p>Yes. The 14th Amendment says, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”</p><p>The part about jurisdiction creates a very narrow exception that today essentially applies only to children of accredited foreign diplomats. Other than that, the citizenship or immigration status of a person’s parents has not been held to have any effect on this right.</p><p>(The term “birthright citizenship” can also refer to another way a person can be born an American citizen: by having a citizen parent. This source of citizenship, created by federal law rather than directly by the Constitution, has not generally figured in the debate over immigration policy but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/us/politics/11mccain.html" title="">comes up sometimes</a> in <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/06/donald-trump-keeps-dwelling-on-ted-cruz-citizenship-issue/" title="">presidential elections</a>.)</p><h2 id="link-6ee12ff2">Can the president abolish it by himself?</h2><p>No. The president cannot amend the Constitution, and an executive order trying to end or restrict the right would almost certainly be challenged in court as a violation of the 14th Amendment.</p><p>Some of Mr. Trump’s allies have suggested that the jurisdiction language in the amendment could be construed to exclude children of undocumented immigrants, the main targets of demands for ending birthright citizenship. Until now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/us/politics/birthright-citizenship-executive-order-trump.html" title="">the overwhelming scholarly and legal consensus</a> has been that such an argument would have little or no chance of prevailing in court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some legal scholars think that such arguments will continue to be nonstarters in the courts. But the idea that the Supreme Court may at some point find the arguments for restricting birthright citizenship persuasive is “no longer laughable,” said Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on immigration and citizenship law. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/18/us/politics/republican-candidates-2024-immigration.html" title="">Limiting birthright citizenship was the consensus position</a> among Republican presidential candidates in the 2024 election, and <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2024/11/11/an-interview-with-judge-james-c-ho/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least one federal judge has indicated a willingness</a> to consider it.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s inconceivable, which is what I would have said in 2019,” Professor Frost said. “The ground is shifting.”</p><h2 id="link-57b7906e">Do other countries have the same policy?</h2><p>Yes. Thirty-three countries and two territories — nearly all in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico and Canada — have unrestricted birthright citizenship similar to that of the United States, according to a tally <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-with-birthright-citizenship" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by the World Population Review</a>.</p><p>Another 40 have restricted versions of the right that may apply, for example, only to children of legal residents or of parents born in the country, or that exclude refugees.</p><p>Several countries that, like the United States, had traditions of universal birthright citizenship rooted in English common law — including Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and India — have restricted or abolished the right in recent decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-3055d96e">What do critics mean by ‘birth tourism,’ ‘chain migration’ and ‘anchor babies’?</h2><p>Those terms, used by anti-immigration hard-liners and other critics of birthright citizenship, tend to conflate two separate consequences of the policy.</p><p>Each year, thousands of pregnant women from other countries enter the United States on a valid visa, give birth to children who automatically gain American citizenship and then take the babies back home or to a third country. The practice, sometimes called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/california-homes-raided-in-federal-crackdown-on-chinese-birth-tourism.html" title="">birth tourism</a>,” is legal as long as the mother obtains her visa truthfully and complies with its terms.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his supporters, however, tend to talk about expectant mothers who enter the country illegally to give birth to what they derisively call “anchor babies,” who would give the family access to public benefits and a foothold toward legal residence.</p><p>The Migration Policy Institute estimates that, as of 2019, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 4.7 million American-born children</a> under 18 were living with a parent who was undocumented — about 7 percent of all children in the United States. But <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2011/02/01/unauthorized-immigrant-population-brnational-and-state-trends-2010/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies have found that the vast majority</a> of such children did not cross the border in utero. The Pew Research Center estimated in 2022 that about five out of six U.S. children of unauthorized immigrants were born two years or more after their parents entered the United States.</p><p>Whether reared in the United States or abroad, once American children of noncitizen parents reach the age of 21, they can sponsor family members for legal permanent residency, just as any other American citizen can — a practice derided by critics as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/us/politics/the-facts-behind-the-weaponized-phrase-chain-migration.html" title="">“chain migration.”</a> Sponsorship by relatives has featured prominently in the stories of tens of millions of immigrants to the United States over the past century.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabelle Taft is a reporter covering national news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabelle-taft">More about Isabelle Taft</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Fact-Checking Trump:</strong> In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” President-elect Donald Trump repeated several false and inaccurate claims on a range of topics. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/us/politics/trump-nbc-interview-fact-check.html">Here’s a breakdown</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cheney Condemns Trump:</strong> Liz Cheney called Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/us/politics/liz-cheney-donald-trump.html">threat to imprison her</a> and other members of a congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol an “assault on the rule of law.”</p></li><li><p><strong>DOGE Guided by Health Entrepreneur:</strong> The inclusion of Brad Smith in Trump’s efficiency panel, the nascent Department of Government Efficiency, suggests that the team is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-brad-smith-trump.html">preparing to focus particularly on the nation’s health care system</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Civil Cases: </strong>Trump has successfully defeated or impeded many legal challenges against him over the storming of the Capitol, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/us/politics/trump-jan-6-civil-cases.html">eight lawsuits on the matter remain in the courts</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mixed Feelings:</strong> The public may have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/us/elections/trump-tariffs-deportations-polls.html">more nuanced views on issues</a> like tariffs and mass deportations than it might seem at first blush.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
