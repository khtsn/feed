Officials laid out 95 billion euros, or $107 billion, worth of goods that they could target with higher tariffs in retaliation to the duties that the United States has announced or imposed. They also said that the bloc would start a World Trade Organization dispute against the United States on both across-the-board tariffs and on duties on cars and car parts.</p><p>Neither measure will take effect immediately. Instead, European governments will spend the next month consulting on the list of American products that it could hit with higher tariffs. The proposed list includes some agricultural products, such as soybeans, meats, and bourbon, along with manufactured goods that include sewing machines, airplane parts and car parts. It could also curb Europe’s own exports of key chemicals used in food processing, along with scrap metal. </p><p>The European Union did not announce what the tariff rates on those products would be. But if it follows through on its threat, Boeing could be among the companies hit, a senior European official acknowledged. American food companies could also be affected. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By laying the groundwork to retaliate against the United States, the European Union is creating a clear-cut threat that will hang over the Trump administration. European officials still hope to negotiate to avoid lasting tariffs, but no clear solution is in sight, even as the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/business/economy/trump-trade-britain.html" title="">prepared to announce</a> a trade agreement with Britain on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>“We believe there are good deals to be made for the benefit of consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a statement announcing the plan. “At the same time, we continue preparing for all possibilities, and the consultation launched today will help guide us in this necessary work.”</p><p>European Union officials are increasingly moving away from simply talking about how to retaliate and toward talking about a long-term rebalancing of its trade relationship with the United States. That is a recognition that at least some of the new tariffs might remain in place over the long term.</p><p>The E.U.’s latest announcement came after several waves of fresh tariffs from the United States were unveiled over the last few months.</p><p>The Trump administration has rolled out its trade measures in phases: First, it imposed tariffs on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html" title="">steel and aluminum</a>, then announced them for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/trump-tariffs-auto-cars.html" title="">cars and car parts</a>, and then declared <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/economy/trump-tariffs.html" title="">across-the-board tariffs</a> that would applied to different geographies differently. Those so-called “reciprocal” tariffs would have placed a 20 percent tariff on goods coming into the U.S. from the European Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The bloc has already taken some actions to respond. Last month, it approved plans for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/eu-tariffs-trump.html" title="">retaliatory measures</a> to the steel and aluminum tariffs that would hit about $23 billion worth of American goods.</p><p>But it did so just hours before the Trump administration announced that it would pause the 20 percent across-the-board tariffs for 90 days, applying only a smaller 10 percent duty in their place.</p><p>European Union officials responded by pausing their first wave of retaliatory tariffs as a sign of good will. At the same time, officials also made it clear that they would still plan for a broader retaliation in case negotiations stalled.</p><p>Thursday’s announcement is a sign that those preparations are continuing. </p><p>While Thursday’s list touches only goods, European officials have been clear that if the trade fight deepens, they could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/economy/tariffs-foreign-goods-tariffs-us-services.html" title="">hit the American services</a> sector. That is a serious vulnerability for the U.S., since European consumers are major users of American technologies, including cloud computing, search engines and social media.</p><p>But many officials see that as a last-ditch option.</p><p>For now, the E.U. has been clear that its goal is to negotiate, and that if deal-making is successful, retaliation might be avoidable.</p><p>The goal is to have the legal plans ready “in case negotiations with the U.S. do not produce a satisfactory result,” the statement said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Energy Star Program:</strong> The Environmental Protection Agency plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html">eliminate the popular energy efficiency certification</a> for dishwashers, refrigerators, dryers and other home appliances, according to agency documents and a recording of an internal meeting.</p></li><li><p><strong>President Trump and Mark Carney Meet</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The president played nice when he came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/trump-canada-love.html">face-to-face with the new prime minister of Canada</a>, the country he has spent months belittling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Venezuela’s Opposition Leaders Flee</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Five top Venezuelan opposition figures who had been sheltering for 412 days at the Argentine diplomatic residence in the capital, Caracas, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-argentina-embassy-maduro.html">left the country and are now in the United States</a>, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turning Back the Economic Clock?</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The president thinks he can return America to manufacturing glory — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/magazine/trump-economy-finance-history.html">but the cycles of economic history are hard to break</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Britain’s Failed Rwanda Deportation Deal: </strong>The United States is said to be in talks with the African country about taking in expelled migrants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/europe/trump-migrants-rwanda-us-uk.html">There may be lessons in London’s experience</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strikes on Houthi Militants: </strong>The United States and Houthis in Yemen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/trump-houthis-bombing.html">reached a deal to halt American airstrikes</a> against the group after the Iranian-backed militants agreed to cease attacks against American vessels in the Red Sea, President Trump and Omani mediators said.</p></li><li><p><strong> </strong><strong>California’s High-Speed Rail:</strong> Trump said that the federal government will not pay for the state’s high-speed train, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/california-high-speed-rail-federal-funding.html">another potential wrinkle in a troubled project</a> that has repeatedly blown past its budget and completion timeline since voters approved funding in 2008.</p></li><li><p><strong>Normalizing Tariffs:</strong> By threatening gigantic tariffs and then walking them back, the president seems to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/trump-tariffs-10-percent.html">increased the acceptance</a>, at least in some circles, of the significant tariffs that remain in place.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
