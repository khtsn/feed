As a result, the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association estimates, 225 dealers selling other brands were unable to claim about 10 million in Canadian dollars, putting some of them in financial peril.</p><p>“When you’re looking at a 43 million dollar hit over a weekend, an investigation is definitely warranted,” said Huw Williams, a spokesman for the dealers’ association. “The level of transactions just does not make common sense.’’ </p><p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The Toronto Star first reported the sales rush claims, which were posted on a government website that tracks rebate payments.</p><p>Under the government plan, which began in 2019, dealers deducted rebates of up to 5,000 Canadian dollars when they sold electric vehicles before reporting the purchase information — including buyers’ names and the vehicles’ identification numbers — to the government for reimbursement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The torrent of Tesla claims started on Jan. 10 after Transport Canada warned dealers across the country that the program would run out of money before the end of March. By Monday morning, the account was empty and the program was closed.</p><p>About 1,000 dealers selling other brands submitted claims over that weekend but Tesla accounted for about 88 percent of the applications.</p><p>“How did Tesla magically know to hit that number?” Mr. Williams asked, referring to the draining of the rebate program’s remaining funds.</p><p>While some dealers stacked up claims before submitting them to the government, Mr. Williams said, the Tesla surge “doesn’t fit any pattern for Tesla going backwards.” </p><p>He also said that it was physically impossible for the four Tesla dealerships to keep thousands of cars on hand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Williams said that Ms. Freeland told his group that dealers who missed out after Tesla emptied the fund would ultimately be reimbursed, but that how long that might take was unclear.</p><p>Tesla has become a particular <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/canada/tesla-canada-musk-trump-tariffs.html" title="">source of anger among Canadia</a>ns since President Trump began imposing tariffs on Canada and calling for Canada to become the 51st state. Annexation has also been championed by Mr. Musk, who holds Canadian citizenship and lived in Canada before moving to the United States.</p><p>An online petition calling on the Canadian government to revoke Mr. Musk’s citizenship has drawn hundreds of thousands of signatures.</p><p>More than 80 Teslas were vandalized, their tires punctured and their paint scratched at a dealer in Hamilton, Ontario, this month. A Tesla outlet in Montreal was defaced with pink paint. And in Vancouver, organizers of an auto show banned the company over concerns about possible protests and vandalism. </p><p>Four Canadian provinces have excluded Tesla from their electric vehicle rebate programs this year. </p><p>At least one Tesla competitor has been trying to cash in on the antipathy. Polestar, the Swedish -based, Chinese-controlled EV maker, is offering Canadians a 5,000 Canadian dollar discount if they can prove that they are registered Tesla owners.<br/></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
