The Tallahassee, Fla., office of the Weather Service warned of widespread rainfall totals between two and six inches, with localized amounts of 10 inches or more possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The system is forecast to shift gradually north on Monday, moving into the Tennessee Valley. More rounds of rain and thunderstorms will affect the Southeast into parts of the Mid-Atlantic.</p><p>The Weather Prediction Center said that rainfall could be especially intense along the Southeast coast and in the mountainous regions. Urban areas along the coast of Virginia were also included in their flood outlook as they are especially prone to flooding during periods of heavy rain.</p><p>“We’re looking at a focus along the Blue Ridge, so that’s the eastern side of the Appalachians,” said Mr. Jackson. “Also, along the Carolina coast, up from Myrtle Beach and eastern North Carolina is another focused area for some significant rainfall.”</p><p>Some forecasters expressed concern that portions of North Carolina and South Carolina could receive their highest rainfall.</p><p>The Raleigh, N.C., office of the Weather Service said it expected two to four inches of rain through Tuesday night, with local amounts up to five inches possible. Forecasters said the heaviest rainfall was expected on Monday and Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As the system continues its slow progression, the risk of flash flooding remains for parts of the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday. Additional rounds of heavy rain are expected, especially in Virginia and northern North Carolina.</p><p>The Weather Service noted that the current Level 2 risk of flash floods for portions of the Mid-Atlantic may be upgraded to Level 3 (out of four tiers) early this week, depending on how the forecast evolves.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nazaneen Ghaffar is a Times reporter on the Weather team.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
