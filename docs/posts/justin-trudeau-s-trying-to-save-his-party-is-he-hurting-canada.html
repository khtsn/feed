But they will also leave Canada weakened as it braces for President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has threatened the country with tariffs that could cripple its economy.</p><p>It appears to be a gamble that Mr. Trudeau is willing to take.</p><p>To allow his party’s thousands of members to choose his successor, a lengthy process that will involve campaigning, Mr. Trudeau suspended Parliament until March 24. A general election is expected to follow.</p><p>Holding a party leadership election before a general one is par for the course in countries with parliamentary systems like Canada’s. Suspending Parliament to hold such an election is far less common. By doing so, Mr. Trudeau wards off the likely collapse of his minority government and gives the Liberals time to choose a leader unburdened by his dismal poll numbers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But it means that in two weeks, when Mr. Trump returns to the Oval Office, Mr. Trudeau will be leading Canada as a lame duck, weakening the country’s hand in crucial negotiations with its closest ally.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trudeau with then-President Donald J.

(It would also be injurious to the U.S. economy; the two nations are each other’s biggest trading partners.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The president-elect has persistently suggested that Canada should become part of the United States, calling it the “51st state.” He repeated his menacing joke on social media on Monday, after Mr. Trudeau’s resignation announcement: “Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State,” Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social, promising no tariffs if Canada “merged with the U.S.” </p><p>On Tuesday, speaking at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump<span>  </span>went as far as to suggest that he might use “economic force” against Canada to acquire it, highlighting just how high the stakes are for Canada. </p><h3 id="link-3cd019fa"><span>Party first</span></h3><p>When Mr. Trudeau became the Liberals’ leader, the party was in shambles. In the 2011 national elections, it finished third for the first time in its history. Mr. Trudeau, who assumed its leadership in 2013, is widely credited with raising it from the dead and leading it back into government two years later.</p><p>“The Liberal Party, such as it is, has been the Justin Trudeau party for more than a decade,” said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a research center. That has made it hard for the party to let go of him and for Mr. Trudeau to relinquish control, Ms. Kurl said.</p><p>But finally, on Monday morning, after weeks of pressure from within the party to resign, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged that his time was up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I truly feel that removing the contention around my own continued leadership is an opportunity to bring the temperature down,” he told reporters gathered in the freezing cold outside his Ottawa residence.</p><p>“It’s become obvious to me with the internal battles that I cannot be the one to carry the Liberal standard into the next election,” he added. Until the Liberals choose their new leader, Mr. Trudeau said, he will stay on in that role and as prime minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trudeau after leading the Liberal Party to victory in the general election of 2015. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The party’s internal election process, which will last several weeks, will allow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/canada/justin-trudeau-replacement.html" title="">a handful of hopefuls</a> to reintroduce themselves to the public, no longer as Trudeau associates but as individuals vying for the party’s and the country’s leadership.</p><p>“I think the Liberals are now clinging to the idea that there is no longer a path forward for him, but there is absolutely a path forward for someone else,” Ms. Kurl said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Still, with the Conservatives leading the Liberals by 25 percentage points in recent surveys, the path that Mr. Trudeau bequeaths his successor is likely to be treacherous.</p><p>“Sixty or 90 days are not a long time to reinvent a party after 10 years in power,” Ms. Kurl said. “How many more rabbits are in the hat? How many more pivots are there?”</p><h3 id="link-70a2a2a9"><span>Brief relief</span></h3><p>For many Canadians, Mr. Trudeau’s departure was a necessary condition if they were going to consider voting for the Liberals.</p><p>David Coletto, who leads Abacus Data, a polling company, said early research on Monday suggested that Canadians felt relief at the news of Mr. Trudeau’s resignation, and that his departure had the potential to shift attention away from his unpopularity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“People are saying they feel relieved and optimistic about the prime minister stepping down,’’ he said. “That’s a signal to me that there’s potentially an opportunity for the Liberals to rebuild the relationship with Canadians.” But it is far from certain that this will happen, he cautioned.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The House of Commons in Ottawa on Monday.
