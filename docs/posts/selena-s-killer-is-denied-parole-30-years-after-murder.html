The decision came a few days shy of the 30th anniversary of the killing, which shocked her fans and spurred a cultlike following.</p><p>Yolanda Saldívar, the woman who fatally shot her, was the founder of Selena’s fan club; she killed Selena after a confrontation in a motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, on March 31, 1995. A jury convicted Ms. Saldívar of first-degree murder, and she was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.</p><p>Ms. Saldívar’s case had gone into the review process approximately six months before she was to first become eligible for parole this Sunday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole said in a statement. She won’t be eligible for parole for five more years.</p><p>“After a thorough consideration of all available information, which included any confidential interviews conducted, it was the parole panel’s determination to deny parole to Yolanda Saldivar and set her next parole review for March 2030,” <a href="https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/bpp/Statement_Concerning_Parole_Review_Decision_of_Yolanda_Saldivar.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the statement said</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The panel cited the violent nature of the killing as the reason for its denial.</p><p>“The record indicates that the instant offense has elements of brutality, violence, assaultive behavior or conscious selection of victim’s vulnerability indicating a conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others, such that the offender poses a continuing threat to public safety,” the statement said.</p><p>When she was killed, Selena had just come off a Grammy Award win. She was on the verge of making a breakthrough that could have brought her songs about heartbreak and new love to wider Spanish- and English-speaking audiences.</p><p>“Selena was a once-in-a-generation artist,” Maria Garcia, the host and creator of the podcast “<a href="https://www.wbur.org/podcasts/anythingforselena" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anything for Selena</a>,” said on Thursday. “She revolutionized music, fashion and body politics in the U.S.”</p><p>Here’s why Selena’s case was drawing attention from fans across the country, and more about her legacy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Selena performing at the Astrodome in Houston on Feb. 26, 1995.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Everett/Houston Chronicle, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3e4e1940">Who was Selena?</h2><p>Selena Quintanilla Pérez was born in Lake Jackson, near Houston, in 1971. She began singing professionally when she was nine years old. She, along with her family band, Selena y Los Dinos, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/arts/pop-review-mexican-independence-in-new-york.html" title="">one of the biggest acts</a> in Tejano music. Tejano, also known as Tex-Mex, is a modern blend of Mexican- and European-influenced polkas and guitar music. She later married Chris Perez, a neighbor who was the lead guitarist in Selena y Los Dinos.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Selena was the reigning queen of the Tejano music world at the time of her death. Her 1993 album, “Live,” won best Mexican American album, making her the first female Tejano artist to win a Grammy. Her album “Amor Prohibido” (“Forbidden Love”) sold 400,000 copies in the United States and many more in Mexico. Everything she sang came from personal experience.</p><p>Selena made her film debut, in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/movies/film-review-johnny-depp-with-a-don-juan-complex.html" title="">Don Juan DeMarco</a>,” exactly one week after she was killed. She was also about to release her first English-language album, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/27/movies/the-pop-life-831295.html" title="">Dreaming of You</a>.” When it was released, it sold 175,000 copies on the first day, a record at the time for a female vocalist.</p><p>“When someone passes, one often hears that they lit up a room or that they had a heart of gold,” Ms. Garcia said. “But with Selena, those ideas were demonstrably true. Speak to anyone who knew her well and it’s clear this was an extraordinarily generous person with a magnetic charisma.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Selena’s at her funeral.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Barbara Laing/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-d15c1b4">How was she killed?</h2><p>Ms. Saldívar, a registered nurse, was the founder of Selena’s fan club and a manager of Selena Etc., a boutique and beauty salon. Ms. Saldívar, 34, was fired after Selena’s family accused her of embezzling money.</p><p>Selena went to pick up financial documents, which Ms. Saldívar had in her room at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi, trial testimony showed.</p><p>After an argument, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/01/obituaries/grammy-winning-singer-selena-killed-in-shooting-at-texas-motel.html" title="">Selena was shot</a> in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the room. She ran and collapsed and died in the nearby lobby.</p><p>Ms. Saldívar — during a 10-hour standoff with the police said, “I didn’t mean to do it. I didn’t mean to kill anybody.” She told officers that she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.</p><p>A jury in Houston took less than three hours <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/us/texas-jury-convicts-fan-of-killing-recording-star.html" title="">to convict her</a> in October 1995.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A portrait of the singer Selena Quintanilla is seen in the crowd following a posthumous star ceremony for Quintanilla on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Pizzello/Invision, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-ec16c47">What is her legacy?</h2><p>The Recording Academy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/14/arts/live-grammy-awards/selena-lifetime-achievement-award" title="">gave her</a> its lifetime achievement award during its Grammys telecast in 2021. Recently, there has also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/arts/television/selena-the-series-netflix.html" title="">a Netflix series</a> and a <a href="https://www.wbur.org/podcasts/anythingforselena" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcast</a> to introduce her to a new generation as well as a nostalgia trip for millions of longtime fans.</p><p>She described her music in an interview in 1994 with the San Jose Mercury News. “It’s got polka in it, a little bit of country, a little bit of jazz,” she said. “Fuse all those types of music together. I think that’s where you get Tejano.”</p><p>There was a surge of Hispanic artists after Selena made singing in both English and Spanish much more popular with mainstream American audiences. One of those artists was Jennifer Lopez, who found her initial fame playing Selena in the 1997 film “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/21/movies/a-short-life-remembered-with-songs-and-sunshine.html" title="">Selena</a>.” That film made Selena a household name north of the border, and showed that cross-cultural identity was no barrier to commercial success.</p><p>“Dreaming of You,” the English-language album that she was working on when she died, went to the top of the Billboard 200 chart three months afterward, selling three million copies in the U.S. It featured the hits “I Could Fall in Love” and “Dreaming of You.”</p><p>In 2017, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Selena crossed most consequential borders: cultural, ethnic, geographical, linguistic and musical.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Garcia said that Selena’s image became a shorthand for Latino identity.</p><p>“An attack on her is perceived as an attack on a collective, a people. Latinos feel protective of her legacy. Because it is also our legacy, our cultural patrimony. ”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adeel Hassan is a reporter and editor on the National Desk.
