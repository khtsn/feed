On Monday, <a href="https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/news_article?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGMTE1MjE3Lmh0bWwmYWxsPTE%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the New South Wales police said</a> that he had abused eight victims between 2001 and 2019, the youngest of whom was 17 at the time of the abuse. He faces charges including aggravated indecent assault and sexually touching another person without consent.</p><p>Mr. Jones was once one of Australia’s most influential talk radio personalities, hosting a morning show on <a href="https://www.2gb.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2GB</a>, a Sydney station, from 2002 through 2020. He started out as a schoolteacher before moving to radio, and along the way wrote speeches for Malcolm Fraser, a former prime minister. In the 1980s, Mr. Jones coached the Wallabies, the national men’s rugby union team.</p><p>Last December, The Sydney Morning Herald <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/classic-abuse-of-power-more-men-come-forward-with-claims-about-alan-jones-behaviour-20231217-p5es03.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an article</a> in which multiple men accused Mr. Jones of sexual abuse. The police said they had started a new investigation after the publication of the article. Mr. Jones, the authorities said, knew the alleged victims either personally or professionally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p> Kate McClymont, who wrote the Herald article, said in <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/kate-mcclymont-speaks-about-alan-jones-arrest-20241118-p5kriv.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a broadcast interview</a> on Monday that it could not be emphasized enough “how powerful Alan Jones has been in the media industry in this country.”</p><p>In a news conference, the state police commissioner, Karen Webb, urged other potential victims to come forward. She described the investigation, which started in March, as “complex” and “protracted.”</p><p>While he was on air, Mr. Jones made a number of attacks and disparaging comments. In 2019, he said that Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister at the time, should “shove a sock” down the throat of Jacinda Ardern, Mr. Morrison’s counterpart in New Zealand. Mr. Jones later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zLT2Ewf5go" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apologized</a>. Earlier, he hurled multiple <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/alan-jones-apology-julia-gillard" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insults at Julia Gillard</a>, who was Australia’s prime minister between 2010 and 2013.</p><p>Days before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/14/world/asia/australian-police-move-to-control-ethnic-unrest.html" title="">ethnic unrest</a> erupted in a Sydney suburb in 2005, Mr. Jones referred to people of Lebanese descent as “mongrels.” A <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-03/tribunal-rules-alan-jones-incited-hatred/4292052" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state tribunal</a> later ruled that Mr. Jones had “incited hatred, serious contempt and severe ridicule of Lebanese Muslims” through his speech.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
