But the president-elect’s effort took on added weight in recent days, after Elon Musk endorsed a push to erode the Fed’s independence.</p><p>The fight shows how the future of the Fed could remain high on the agenda, and how far Musk’s influence — and the role of X as place for announcing policy positions — could extend across government.</p><p><strong>The Fed has its foes. </strong>Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, <a href="https://www.lee.senate.gov/2024/6/breaking-the-bank-sen-lee-introduces-bill-to-abolish-the-federal-reserve" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced a bill</a> in June to abolish the central bank, accusing it of being an “economic manipulator that has directly contributed to the financial instability many Americans face today.”</p><p>Lee said on X that he wants to see the Fed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/09/elon-musk-endorses-trump-intervene-federal-reserve.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under the president’s control</a> — a view that <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854783747264012792" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Musk backed</a>.</p><p><strong>Powell could turn to the courts to challenge any White House attempt to exert more control</strong>, according to The Wall Street Journal’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/powell-trump-fed-firing-ac7088e6?mod=hp_lead_pos1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nick Timiraos</a>. Trump appointed Powell in 2017 but flirted with removing him shortly afterward. Powell held onto his job, but was ready for a fight if Trump made a move, Timiraos writes:</p><blockquote><p>Powell told then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that he would fight his removal if sought by the president, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump was upset the Fed was raising interest rates against his wishes.</p><p>For Powell, the unsavory prospect of a legal showdown — one he might have to pay for out of his own pocket — was imperative to preserve the ability of future Fed chairs to serve without the threat of being removed over a policy dispute.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Powell has made it clear that the president doesn’t have the authority to remove a Fed chair.</strong> Last week, he said he wouldn’t step down if Trump asked him to do so after the central bank lowered borrowing costs by a quarter point. Removing him, he added, was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/business/dealbook/powell-trump-white-house-pressure.html" title="">not permitted under the law</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A 1977 law gave Congress more oversight of the Fed, but enshrined the institution’s independence on policy.</p><p><strong>The central bank’s ability to set monetary policy without political influence is a core tenet for markets and the economy. </strong>The Fed also has an outsized influence through its freedom to buy and sell securities, like Treasury notes and bonds, as it looks to bring more liquidity to trading.</p><p>It’s one reason many on Wall Street worry about any attempt to erode Fed independence. They fear it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/business/dealbook/trump-fed-interest-rates.html" title="">destabilize investor confidence</a> in the stock and bond markets. And the White House Council of Economic Advisers has called the independence doctrine <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/05/22/the-importance-of-central-bank-independence/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a critical component in the fight to bring down inflation</a> and promote economic growth.</p><p><strong>Fed watchers are concerned. </strong>“If the president were to succeed at this, that would mean every future chair is subject to removal at the whim of the president,” Scott Alvarez, a former general counsel at the Fed, told The Journal. “I don’t think that’s a precedent Jay would want to set, and that’s why I think he would fight it. This is a humongous precedent.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>The big questions remain:</strong> Would a conservative Supreme Court back Trump in his mission to remake the Fed?
