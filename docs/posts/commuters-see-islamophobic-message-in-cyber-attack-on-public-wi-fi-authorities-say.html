The police said they had received reports of the cyberattack just after 5 p.m. local time, and that they were leading an investigation into the incident. The service was quickly taken down, Network Rail said, and would remain down until security checks were completed.</p><p>The issue emerged at 19 stations across Britain, including major transportation hubs in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Bristol and other cities, a spokesman for Network Rail said in a statement.</p><p>Commuters attempting to log onto Wi-Fi at the stations were met with a webpage that said “We love you, Europe,” along with information related to terror attacks in Europe, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/manchester-piccadilly-uk-stations-targeted-30009246" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Manchester Evening News reported</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Wi-Fi was a “click-and-connect” service that did not collect any personal data and was operated by a third-party company, Telent, Network Rail’s statement said.</p><p>Telent, a technology and communications company, on Thursday <a href="https://telent.com/news/public-wi-fi-outage-at-network-rails-managed-stations" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pointed</a> to Global Reach, a provider that ran the Wi-Fi service’s landing page. Telent said in a statement that it had found that an “unauthorized change was made to the Network Rail landing page from a legitimate Global Reach administrator account.”</p><p>British Transport Police were investigating the matter as a criminal case, Telent said, and no personal data was affected by the incident. But, as a precaution, it said, it had temporarily suspended all use of Global Reach services to confirm that none of its other customers had been impacted.</p><p>Global Reach did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.</p><p>Britain’s crime and cybersecurity agencies were also helping with the investigation, the Transport Police said on Thursday.</p><p>The disruption follows another “<a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/cyber-security-incident" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cybersecurity incident</a>” on Sept. 1 that targeted Transport for London, the agency that runs the city’s public transit network, in which hackers accessed the contact details of the agency’s customers, and potentially could view bank account details for some commuters. The cyberattack also affected the broadcasting of live train schedules online and payment systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A 17-year-old was arrested in Walsall, a town in the West Midlands county of England, as part of the investigation into that attack, cybercrime authorities <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/arrest-made-in-nca-investigation-into-transport-for-london-cyber-attack" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> this month.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
