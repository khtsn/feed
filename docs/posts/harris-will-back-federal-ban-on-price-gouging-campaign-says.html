    <h1>Harris Will Back Federal Ban on Price Gouging, Campaign Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The officials also said Ms. Harris would authorize the Federal Trade Commission to impose “harsh penalties” on corporations that fix prices. They said that she would direct more resources toward investigating price-gouging in the supply chain for meat and that she would push federal officials to closely scrutinize proposed grocery mergers.</p><p>They also said that Ms. Harris would unveil plans on Friday related to housing costs and prescription drug prices. Many states ban price gouging, but the federal government does not.</p><p>Inflation and prices are an obstacle for Ms. Harris as she faces off with former President Donald J. Trump this fall. Price growth soared in the first two years of Mr. Biden’s administration. It is falling toward historically normal levels now, though prices remain elevated from where they were three years ago. On Wednesday, the annual inflation rate dipped under 3 percent for the first time since 2021.</p><p>Economists largely blame a mix of factors for the price surge, including snarls in global supply chains related to the pandemic recession and economic stimulus from the Federal Reserve and Congress — including increased federal spending and tax cuts approved first by Mr. Trump, then Mr. Biden.</p><p>Over the last year, as grocery prices in particular have dragged on Mr. Biden’s approval rating, progressive groups urged him to blame something else for high prices: powerful corporations, whose profits soared during the pandemic. Mr. Biden has partly complied. He has gone after meatpacking companies and oil companies over high prices. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/us/politics/biden-prices-shrinkflation.html" title="">admonished companies</a> regarding so-called shrinkflation — reducing the size of a product, like a bag of chips or a candy bar, while keeping the price the same or even raising it.</p></div></div>
