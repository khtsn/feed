To his detractors, the former interior minister is a dangerous right-wing extremist who trades in conspiracy theories.</p><p>But after Austrians vote in a national election on Sunday, Mr. Kickl may end up as the man Austria’s other parties will have to either work with or work around.</p><p>Five years after his party was ousted by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/europe/austria-strache-resigns-video.html" title="">jaw-dropping scandal</a> involving cocaine, a fake niece of a Russian oligarch, influence peddling and a secret video recording, the Freedom Party is back, and is now the most popular party in Austria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It could come out on top for the first time ever in elections. The party is expected to win 27 percent of votes or more, polls show, beating out the incumbent center-right Austrian People’s Party by several percentage points, and other mainstream parties by even more.</p><p>Unlike in neighboring Germany, where the growing popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has set off anxious hand-wringing in the political establishment, in Austria few seem especially concerned by the rise of the Freedom Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Freedom Party supporters at an election campaign meeting in Graz, Austria, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Leonhard Foeger/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Founded by former SS men in the 1950s, the Freedom Party has long been part of Austria’s political landscape. It has been the junior partner in four separate governments since the 1980s.</p><p>The party “is so normalized in Austria that few people will be shocked by it — and they have already had parliamentary election results on this scale,” said Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik, a professor of Austrian politics at the University of Vienna.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Germany, mainstream parties have vowed never to work with the AfD. And the German domestic intelligence service has labeled some AfD state chapters as extremist and is actively monitoring the party, which it considers a threat to the Constitution.</p><p>Austria is more akin to Italy or the Netherlands, where anti-immigrant sentiment has fueled the rise of far-right parties that work within the established political ecosystem.</p><p>Mr. Kickl often praises Hungary, where the nationalist Fidesz party has governed virtually unopposed for more than a decade, for its ability to keep out migrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Border police officers searching vehicles in Berg, Austria, in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christian Bruna/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The coronavirus pandemic and Austria’s strict lockdown rules helped Mr. Kickl re-energize his party after it was kicked out of the government five years ago. Mr. Kickl demanded a public inquest into government actions around lockdowns, which he called “dictatorial.” At the time of the pandemic, Mr. Kickl was a proponent of the anti-parasite drug ivermectin.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At the height of the pandemic in 2021, he told supporters: “The Austrian population is part of a large field study by pharmaceutical companies.”</p><p>But much of his focus in the recent campaign has been on immigrants. Besides calling for more deportations, the Freedom Party’s platform also demands new legislation that would stop refugees from getting any social services and bar them for life from obtaining Austrian citizenship.</p><p>Besides refugees, Mr. Kickl attacks supranational institutions, like the European Union, NATO (of which Austria is not a member), the International Criminal Court and the World Health Organization for meddling in Austrian affairs.</p><p>The party is also close to Russia. In 2016, it signed a formal declaration of friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin’s party, United Russia. Karin Kneissl, the Freedom Party’s choice for foreign minister in 2017, moved to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. While the rest of Europe has mostly cut off its use of Russian energy since the invasion, Austria has not done so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lining up to get vaccinated against the coronavirus in Salzburg in 2021.

He started working for the Freedom Party as a student in history and philosophy, and quickly rose through the ranks.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He served as a speechwriter for Jörg Haider, who took over the party in 1986 and moved it further toward far-right populism. Mr. Kickl was responsible for some of his most incendiary speeches. Mr. Haider, who later left the party and created a new one, died in a car accident in 2008.</p><p>As Austrian interior minister from 2017 to 2019, Mr. Kickl focused on border security, but may be best remembered for overseeing a raid on the country’s domestic intelligence agency. At the time, Mr. Kickl’s clear <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/world/europe/austria-far-right-freedom-party.html" title="">political influence over the service</a> made it a pariah among partner agencies.</p><p>In rallies, debates and advertisements, Mr. Kickl has distanced himself from his party’s former coalition partner, the conservative Austrian People’s Party, which was itself roiled by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/17/world/europe/austria-sebastian-kurz-scandal-chancellor.html?searchResultPosition=12" title="">a scandal involving fake polls</a> in recent years.</p><p>Mr. Kickl now blames his biggest opponent for inflation and a declining standard of living.</p><p>“We have actually come through difficult times reasonably well, as far as the Ukraine war is concerned,” said Nina Horaczek, who has written a book on Mr. Kickl. “But at the same time, there is an incredible dissatisfaction in parts of the population, and he is channeling that very, very well.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Karl Nehammer, the current chancellor, said that if the Freedom Party won, he would not form a coalition government that would make Mr. Kickl chancellor. But he has stopped short of vowing not to work with the far-right party itself, something that experts say could happen if the People’s Party comes in first, thus ensuring that Mr. Nehammer remains chancellor.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A campaign poster for Karl Nehammer, the head of People’s Party. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elisabeth Mandl/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>If the far right wins, Mr. Nehammer could choose to isolate the Freedom Party and form a government with center-left Social Democrats and possibly a third party.</p><p>But a coalition between the conservatives and the far right is still considered a likely outcome, “simply because the parties are relatively close on many issues,” said Thomas Meyer, a politics professor at the University of Vienna.</p><p>Predicting the outcome has been made even harder this year by two tiny parties — the Austrian Communists and the Beer Party — that are close to reaching the 4 percent needed to enter the 183-seat Parliament.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Severe flooding in early September also led to a suspension of national campaigning and may give a boost to the Greens, a junior partner in the current government.</p><p>On a recent evening in Simmering, a working-class district in Vienna, Sascha Kaiser, a local resident, was having a drink after work and mulling the question of whom to vote for. “I don’t know whether to vote strategic or follow my heart,” he said. “But I don’t want Kickl to get in.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-21"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
