Ideas floated to take over Canada, Gaza, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. “Canada would be much better off being our 51st state. We’re going to have Gaza. We don’t have to buy. There’s nothing to buy.” It’s only the very beginning of the Trump administration. But already, Democrats are struggling to mount an effective opposition to what they see as an attempt to upend American democracy. Senator Ruben Gallego has some advice. “What I’m seeing is a lot of people that are just kind of frozen.” The junior Democratic senator from the swing state of Arizona won a tight race this past November. It was one of the few bright spots for Democrats. His personal story of growing up poor, studying at Harvard, joining the Marines, and then fighting in Iraq helped him connect with demographic groups Democrats need to win back. The question is, can his recipe for success be replicated by a party that is looking for a way in from the cold? “We’re more stuck on appeasing a group of people that don’t actually represent any constituencies than actually taking care of people’s real lives.” “I’m Lulu Garcia-Navarro, and here’s my interview with Senator Ruben Gallego.” [THEME MUSIC] [SPEAKING SPANISH] “Oh, man. Now I’m intimidated. Your Spanish is way better than mine.” “Ah!” - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [SPEAKING SPANISH] “Oh, wow.” “Senator, thank you so much for being with us today. I almost don’t know where to start because so much has happened in such a short amount of time. And it occurs to me you’re a first-term senator, but you were in the House for about 10 years before that.” “That’s right, yep.” “And you were in Congress during the first Trump administration.” “I was, actually, yeah.” “Yeah. Sp I guess I’m wondering, does this time feel different?” “It does. And two things. No. 1, a lot what you see Trump is doing now is what he tried the first time around. But this time around, we don’t have Republican allies. What that means is that we’re basically fighting on our own. For me, this is more reminiscent of when I was in the state house, when the Republicans had full control of the House, the Senate, and — ” “In Arizona.” “Yeah, and the governorship in Arizona. And there was just no way of stopping them except for trying to find the best way to bring to light what problems they were causing, what they were violating, what they were going to overall just turning the state into. And right now, I think that’s where you’re seeing a lot of the Democratic establishment party elected officials trying to figure out what to do.” “Do you see a shift in how seriously the party is taking this moment?” “I do think that the party, and at least talking to my colleagues, are starting to see that this is an existential threat, if they keep going down this road. If we can’t rely on the judiciary to be part of those checks and balances, then what is left? I think what I’m seeing is a lot of people that are just kind of frozen. And it’s something that happens a lot when situations become out of the norm. And so people want to make something that’s not normal normal, because if you actually have to accept the reality, it gets very, very scary. For me, I think we are sliding into that.” “Mm. And I guess the big question for Democrats is what it means to be an effective opposition party. And I think there are two issues here, right? One is what Democrats should actually do to counter Trump’s actions, and the other is how you should communicate what you’re doing. There is talk of using government spending, which has to be negotiated by March 14, as leverage. Obviously, the risk is that if there is a shutdown, the Democrats will be blamed for that at a moment when, indeed, the party is trying to reach voters, rebuild itself, communicate that it is a party worth voting for. Is the risk too high?” “I mean, the risk is always there. We can’t be afraid of failing. That’s No. 1. I think that’s the biggest mistake I’ve seen Democrats do is say, we’re always afraid. We’re always afraid of failing, so we don’t take risks. It’s OK for us to recognize that that is a potential fallback. But we could also be working to mitigate that somehow. And what does that look like? Making sure that we meet the moment where the American public is. And maybe that moment will happen soon. I’m not sure it’s March 15, but making sure that we’re talking to them, we’re showing them that we’re the ones that are trying to be the people that are, No. 1, protecting the Constitution, number two, fighting for you. Because all this BS that’s happening right now, prices are still high. The cost of eggs are still high. People can’t buy homes. And I think that’s the one thing that we still need to figure out how to pivot back, because that’s where the Republicans are the weakest at. They own this economy now, and they’re not doing stuff for everyday Americans right now.” “I could see you in your brain changing the word.” “My wife warned me before I left for work today not to swear. But the problem is, I think we have to separate what we’re hearing from the D.C. crowd from what we’re hearing kind of in the streets, from what we’re hearing about everyday common Americans. Because I go back to Arizona, they’re actually not talking about U.S.A.I.D., and they’re not talking about the courts. They’re still talking about egg prices. They’re still talking about the cost of everything. So one of the things we have to be very mindful of is that we may engage in a fight, but the rest of the American public may not be with us because they don’t understand this fight. And we need to make sure that we’re matching our politics to what actually is happening in the world. Because sometimes, when we have that disconnect, we miss, and then we miss really, really badly. And unfortunately, now we know we can’t miss because when we do, it has political fallout. Like, the stuff that’s happening right now is because we entirely missed where the American public was during the 2024 election.” “I want to take a step back because, as we’ve mentioned, Democrats are trying to redefine their party. And your victory in a state that Trump won has been framed as possibly offering a model for what kind of message actually works. You outperformed Harris in your state, meaning that you won over some Trump voters. Why do you think that happened?” “Because I do understand that not all Trump voters are actual straight-down-the-line Trump voters. I think there’s a lot of people that voted for Trump because they were frustrated with what was happening in this country, and we weren’t afraid to reach out to them. And we went to some of the hardest places in the state from some Republican counties. We sat down with Trump supporters. We weren’t afraid to talk to them, and we did it repeatedly.” “Do you think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters?” “I think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters. I think Democrats are afraid to talk to people that are going to criticize them. And I think that’s — in a state like Arizona, there’s 300,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in Arizona. I had no choice. It was either do it, or you’re not going to make it. And so we went out there. We sat down. We met with them. And our messaging also was very, very clear to the everyday Arizonan, which I think is very different than the national campaign was.” “Why do you think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters?” “I don’t know. I feel like if a lot of them had been doing it, I think they probably would have done a little better. Like, why aren’t they going into the reddest areas of the country and talking to them? Donald Trump goes to Harlem. Do we go to the equivalent of Harlem for the red voter? No, we don’t.” “I want to talk through some demographic groups that Democrats really need to win back if they want to be competitive.” “Everybody? Yeah.” “I mean, men, for example.” “Yeah.” “You’ve been described to me as a bro.” - [LAUGHS]: “And not in a bad way, just as a kind of persona.” “Yeah.” “You won Latino men by 30 points in an election that saw Trump dominate that group.” “Yeah.” “I know men are a very broad group. But what do you think Democrats have misunderstood about men?” “We could be working to make the status of men better without, at the same time, diminishing the status of women. And a lot of times, we forget that we still need men to vote for us. That’s how we still win elections. But we don’t really talk about making the life of men better, working to make sure that they have wages so they could support their families. I also think some of this is just purely psychological, that a lot of times we just can’t put our finger on. But during my campaign, I noticed when I was talking to men, especially Latino men, about the feeling of pride bringing money home, being able to support your family, the feeling of bringing security, for them, they wanted to hear that someone understood that need. And a lot of times, we are so afraid, I think, of communicating that to men because we think somehow we’re going to also diminish the status of women. And I think we need to understand that that’s going to end up being a problem. The fact that we don’t talk this way at all to them makes them just think that we don’t really care about them, when in fact, even when we’re not talking about them and we’re not campaigning about them, the Democrats on par are actually very good about the status of working-class men. I think Democrats need to figure out how we communicate that to guys and be like, Hey, we’re going to make sure that you’re going to have a good-paying job so you can start a family. It was a joke, but I said it a lot when I was talking to Latino men, like, I’m going to make sure you get out of your mom’s house, right? You get your [SPANISH]. For English speakers, that means your truck. Every Latino man wants a big-ass truck, which is nothing wrong with that, either. And you’re going to go start your own job, and you’re going to become rich, right? These are the conversations that we should be having. And for some reason, we have become — we’re afraid of saying these types of things. We’re afraid of saying like, hey, let’s help you get a job so you become rich. We use terms like bring more economic stability to you, right? And these guys don’t want that. They don’t want economic stability. They want to really live the American dream. And so honestly, the reason I think I did better than most male Democratic politicians is because I communicated that to them in the very simplest of terms, and that’s it.” “I mean, I think what you’re describing is more traditional values, right?” “But people vote on values.” “Right. But are you saying that Democrats should recognize that people want more traditional gender roles, be less afraid of that?” “No, I think Democrats should recognize that people want them to understand that they matter. Right? But it doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to say the single mom is less important than the father. That’s not what we’re saying. But just saying yes, you matter, too. You matter in this world, right? You are deserving of a government that’s going to respond to somebody. Because supposedly, as Democrats we are supposed to be fighting for everybody, but the way that these men think about things and look at the world, they don’t see that. And as someone that grew up on job sites, construction sites, I worked in factories, if you go to these construction sites, these factories, the type of communication you’re hearing that these guys talking to each other, it’s very much not at all what we think. And — ” “Tell me what that means.” “Well, working-class men, especially Latino men, don’t really listen to political commercials. They don’t watch TV news. They largely will talk amongst themselves. And sometimes other working class men will come in with their opinion, and that’s the only thing they’re hearing. That’s it. And — ” “Well, there’s the WhatsApp groups. Come on.” “Yeah. But those WhatsApp groups aren’t good for Democrats, either.” “No.” “And so we have to break that. I mean, so one of the things I did is I would host morning tacos at work sites, right, during the election. So I would go set up, knowing when the 5:30 a.m. shift was coming off, and I’d set up tacos. And I’d hand out tacos to the dudes, and I’d talk to them about life. And we have to understand where they are. We have to understand what they’re hearing. Because what they’re hearing is that the Democrats aren’t really for them, and they’re hearing it from the one dude that heard it from WhatsApp, or the one dude that’s listening to talk radio. And there’s no one saying like, Well, actually, I heard from another guy that Democrats are actually doing this. Doesn’t happen. It just doesn’t happen because there’s no way for us to give them that information, because we’re not going to where they are.” “You know, after the midterms in 2022, when Democrats did better than expected, many Democrats, and you included, seemed to take away that there wasn’t this rightward shift among the Latino community. In fact, you said, and I’m quoting here, ‘Reporters were talking about realignment. There’s no effing — ’” “Realignment.” “Realignment.” “You said ‘effing.’” “I said ‘effing.’ That’s not the word you used. Why did you get it wrong?” “Because I was right then. In 2022, this is when I was the head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. We had polling that showed that there was no slippage happening because men, especially Latino men, were frustrated, but they felt that things were getting better. And there was also an understanding, especially from women, that Democrats were better for them. With the recession — with the personal recession, not necessarily the government recession — continuing on more and more and more, and with housing pricing not going down, that’s when things just started sliding. Economically, we weren’t meeting the demands of where they were. I think they were willing to be hopeful because Biden had just gotten in. A lot of the stimulus money still had not worn out. But starting around, like, early 2023, a lot of the stimulus money went away because we negotiated with the Republicans for it to go away. Interest rates stayed high. And if, for a lot of families, Latino families, owning a home, buying a home is part of the American dream, and now it has gone even further and further away. So the economics just did not improve. And as soon as some of us heard it, we started putting up the warning signs. But it just wasn’t heard.” “Hmm.” “Lastly, what also is the difference is that the way that Trump communicates is actually more apt to get younger Latino men voters. Because where they gather their information, where they listen to politics, is where Trump is more often versus where we are. He’s on podcasts all the time. He’s at UFC fights, right? He’s at all these things where they actually see him being a real, quote-unquote, man. And going into the election, 2023, I also warned Democrats about that — we needed to get out there. I had a lot of recommendations that weren’t listened to. Like I wanted President Biden to go to the Copa América game and sit next to some Latino celebrity. I love boxing. I’m like, let’s go to some boxing matches, right? Let’s take some Democrats to boxing matches and meet where a lot of Latinos are. And the fact is, when you go into a big election in 2024, and you’re going to have a lot of young men coming to vote for the first time that didn’t vote in 2022, and all they’re learning about politics is through podcasts, through UFC fights, we’re going to start losing that vote if we don’t — and we did. And we need to figure out how to get into that world.” “I was actually shocked to learn that President Trump was the first sitting president to go to a Super Bowl game.” “Yeah, and he’ll go to UFC fights. He’s going to go to soccer games. He’s going to do everything, right? And why are we not doing it? I’ll tell you why, because I have heard this before — and I’m not going to tell you which politician was worried about this, but their staff told me, I don’t want my guy getting booed. It’s like, well. So you don’t expose yourself to anybody, but then you also don’t expose yourself to anybody. And again, this isn’t just the president. This is everybody really running last year. This is the thing that we have to understand as Democrats. If we’re not willing to be booed, take chances, the people that really get hurt are the people that we’re supposedly in office for, right, the people that are barely making it now. And they’re going to be hurt because we didn’t take chances.” “Hmm. I want to turn to the subject of class. I interviewed JD Vance before the election, and it struck me that even though your politics are obviously very different than his, your backgrounds do share some similar traits — working class, raised by single mothers, military service in Iraq, went to the Ivy League. And that story of class transition does seem to resonate with voters.” “I think most voters want to believe and do believe in the American dream. And I think when they see examples of that being true, that gives them some hope, right? And I’m sure JD heard this, but I certainly heard about this on the campaign trail from single moms who brought their kids up to me and like, I want them to meet you because I want them to be like you. He’s growing up with the same situation that I am, or that you were, right? And sometimes people miss it. I remember during my campaigns, some of my advisers said, You can’t talk about Harvard. I’m like, Why not? Well, you want working-class people to like you, if you tell them you went to Harvard, you’re going to remind them that you’re not part of that. I’m like, No, you’re not getting it, right? Working-class people appreciate kids going to college. They appreciate especially kids that came from poverty going to college, because that’s part of the story, part of the American dream. And I think whether it comes from left or right, the example really matters, especially when things are rough. Like, you need that kind of hope to hang on to because that’s what helps you get through those days, especially those hard days, is knowing that things will get better. And this is psychologically what people miss about this campaign is when people started feeling like it’s not going to get better. That should have been a big tell that things were going to go south.” “Something I really struggle to reconcile is on the one hand, you have voters saying, as you have shown, that the economy and inflation are their top issues, and they feel the pain of price increases, which is completely understandable. On the other hand, under Trump, we now have the richest Cabinet in modern history. The world’s richest person is gutting the federal government. Yet polls show the president starting his second term with higher approval ratings than when he began his first term. And it sends this confusing message about what the electorate actually wants.” “I don’t think so.” “You have class as a central part of your story, so why don’t you think it’s a confusing message?” “Because people that are working class, poor, don’t necessarily look at the ultrarich as their competitors. They want to be rich someday. And so they don’t necessarily fault the quote-unquote rich for them being rich. Where they do fault them is when it starts affecting them. So they’re going to give Elon and his little weirdos the benefit of doubt. And they’re going to give Donald Trump the benefit of doubt until it proves that it’s actually affecting them personally, right? And that’s when you’ll see them start pushing back. Like, historically speaking, the thing that finally started moving Donald Trump’s numbers away before the 2018 elections was when he gave a massive tax cut to the rich. So I think that’s what’s going to end up happening. I think this administration is going to give a massive tax cut to the rich, and they’re going to do it by cutting Medicaid and other programs for the poor. And that’s when you’re going to see people saying, No, no, no, that’s not what I want.” “So the Democratic message among some Democrats of sort of ‘eat the rich,’ right — ” “Right. No, it’s not going to work.” “That’s not — ” “No.” “ — the right message.” “These people want to be rich. They want to be rich. The base Democratic voter wants to be rich. And there’s nothing wrong with that. And so our job is to expose when there are abuses by, quote-unquote, the rich, the wealthy, the powerful. Then that’s how we get those people that want to aspire to that to vote for Democrats.” “So Elon Musk, Donald Trump, are these the people who have actually figured out how to connect with the working class?” “Yes. Yeah. We just had an election that proved that. I mean — ” “Why?” “Well, I think because they both are two things that I think a lot of Democratic politicians are. No. 1, they actually understand, quote-unquote, the consumer. Right? And because they are engaged in, every day, one way or the other, trying to talk to the consumer. And in this case, it’s the voter, right?” “That’s so interesting. They’re salesmen, essentially.” “Yeah, exactly.” “And they understand who the client is.” “Mm-hmm. The client’s the voter. And they don’t care. By the way, that’s the other thing that’s — they don’t care how they get the sale done. Right? This is why you saw during the campaign, Trump said, You know what? No tax on tips. We’re not going to tax your security, all this kind of stuff. And on the other side, people were like, Well, that’s really going to do something and do an imbalance to the budget deficit. What did Donald Trump care? He just wanted to win, right? What does Elon Musk want to do? He just wants to win, right? He knows where the voter is, and he’ll get there however he can get there. But they’re closer to the ground, to where the base voter is, than to some of us Democrats.” “I want to ask you specifically about immigration, which was one of the central issues of the election, as we mentioned, and one that really hurt Democrats. I’m curious how your own story affects your view of the immigration debate. Your parents emigrated from Colombia and Mexico. What was your family’s experience with the immigration system?” “Well, so most of my experience with the immigration system was already kind of done. My mom was a naturalized citizen when I was born. My father was a legal green-card holder then. I don’t know what his status is now. But my experience was, for example, crossing the border fairly easily, back and forth. Going to work in Mexico, and then coming back when I used to work on the farm. And then whenever things were hard, we’d call up a cousin and say, Hey, we need someone else to come work, right? And they would come up. And so clearly, this is the 1980s. Borders were very fluid. People were coming, getting visas, working, going back. But then it’s also my experience kind of talking to — I have a very extended family on both sides — about their frustration, like, why I need to come to the United States, for example, talking to family in Mexico that had been waiting for their green card or had been waiting for their work visas and were waiting forever. Or even recently, the last six years with the refugee crisis at the border, hearing from Latinos, immigrant Latinos, saying like, Wait a minute, why is that person crossing the border and getting a work permit, and my cousin still doesn’t have a work permit? So I think kind of being closer to where your everyday Latino is on immigration is really what helped kind of set my policy mind-set, because what you were hearing was entirely different from what you were hearing from groups and other opinion leaders about where Latinos were on the border and immigration. There’s nuance within our communities, within the immigrant community, right? They can tell the difference, or they tell the difference, between recent immigrants that came in legally, immigrants that came in 10 years ago illegally, and refugees and asylum seekers right now. And a lot of them will say, That person that came in legally, yes. That person that came in 10 years ago, they shouldn’t have come in illegally, but they’re part of the community now. Let’s give them an opportunity to be U.S. citizens or come out of the shadows. That person that just crossed the border claiming asylum, and now they get a work permit? That’s BS, right? That’s not right. If you’re in that community, that makes sense to you. But if you’re kind of out and looking in, which a lot of Democrats do, that doesn’t make sense. So you just draw a general idea that they all think the same, and they just don’t.” “As senator, your first vote was for the Laken Riley Act. You were one of two Democratic co-sponsors of the bill, the other one being John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. Many in the immigrant advocacy community were, shall we say, unhappy with that position. They have criticized the law. They say it raises due process concerns for immigrants. Another big concern is that it will give states more control over immigration policy, essentially gutting federal authority over that. What was your thinking behind voting for the Laken Riley Act?” “Well, my thinking behind voting for it the second time, because I voted for it also in the House of Representatives, is that this is, again, a response of talking to voters. And they wanted more immigration control and reform. And look, what happened to Laken Riley was horrible. And look, these immigration groups, again, have some very valid points in some areas. But where they’re attacking or where they’re moving is not necessarily in line, again, where the majority of voters or even the immigrant community are. So I heard from them a lot. And the one thing I heard from them is like, this is not what Latinos want. They don’t want this bill. I’m like, That’s actually not true. I go home, and there was a lot of support for bills like this. And certainly, I think that there is a mismatch right now. The immigration groups have moved to a point where they somehow started representing that they represent the voice of Latinos, and they don’t. They’re not even close. And so one of the things I’ve been very clear in also telling my senator is like, listen to the immigration groups because they have good legal advice. Do not listen to the immigration groups if they tell you that this is a representation of where Latinos are, because they are totally off. And I’m responding to what I saw and heard out in Arizona. And that’s why I supported last year and this year.” “This bill, though, does seem to want to change the nature of how immigration is done in this country. And writ large, the architect of this administration’s immigration policies is Stephen Miller, who in the past has promoted hard-line views by citing the work of white nationalist websites, and that’s according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. There does seem to be a strain in this administration that does want to change the makeup of this country.” “Without a doubt, yup.” “Do you worry that voters’ legitimate concerns about our immigration system are being weaponized for ideological ends?” “Well, absolutely. But this isn’t new. I mean, immigration and border have been weaponized in politics for forever, before Donald Trump. I mean, when I was involved in the Arizona State House, it was being weaponized. So none of us should be surprised by it.” “So then was it hard for you to cast that vote, knowing that context? Because — ” “No, because this has been happening for the last 20 years. The context that I worry about is, like, how do we get the trust of people back to the point where we can actually bring the immigration conversation to a more normal state of frame? Let me give you kind of a bigger picture of this. When the Democrats basically dropped the ball on the chaos on the border for many years, we essentially lost the debate on immigration reform for years because the everyday voter doesn’t trust us on the border and on immigration reform. Because for years, they saw that chaos on the border, and we did nothing. The Biden administration finally moved, but by then, it had been so long and the damage had been done. And, by the way, for us that care about immigration reform — and we truly do, and I want to see immigration reform happen. I want to see undocumented families come out of the shadows. I want Dreamers to become citizens, everything else like that — we’ve been set back for years because we hesitated on asylum seekers when we knew in our guts that what was happening there was an abuse of the system, was unpopular with Democrats. But somehow, we decided that we were going to essentially just give the issue to the Republicans, when we could have had a very sane position on this.” “Do you blame President Biden for that?” “I blame President Biden, but I also blame a lot of the people that were advising President Biden, a lot of these groups that were advising President Biden. You’re only as good as the advice that’s given to you, but these immigration groups that I think are looking out for people ended up making the situation a lot worse now.” “Just to understand where you stand on specific issues, for example, should local law enforcement be helping ICE carry out deportations?” “No, because if you talk to local law enforcement, and especially in Arizona, talking to sheriffs and talking to the police, they don’t have the bandwidth. They don’t want to do this. They want to keep the community relationships. And police are there to actually enforce local laws. If it’s someone that is a drug runner or criminal and they need police backup, sure. Why wouldn’t you, if there’s a warrant or anything else like that? But no, you shouldn’t have police doing local immigration laws, especially because can’t even afford it.” “Should migrants be sent to Guantanamo or to prisons in El Salvador?” “Not migrants that have their due process, and especially not ones that aren’t dangerous. But certainly ones that are severely dangerous, like people that have committed crimes, but we can’t legally hold them here, I think there’s something to be said about that.” “I’m surprised.” “For gang members, criminals? I mean, why would we want to keep gang members and criminals that don’t even have a legal right to be here, and Venezuela won’t take them back?” “I think there is a concern that people that get put into these systems, it’s sort of like a black hole. It’s a legal limbo.” “We’ve been having legal limbo for the immigrant community forever. I mean, Guantanamo has been used for refugees and asylum seekers prior to this.” “But not ones that have been in the United States. They’re people who have been caught at sea — ” “Caught at sea. OK, I see what you’re saying.” “Yeah.” “Look, at the same time, we’re dealing in very different situations. If there is a hard-core criminal that has gone through our judicial system, but we can’t actually deport, what are we going to do? I’m not saying, again, we do this for everybody. But there has to be some logical security that we should be thinking about because they’re going to end up being criminals again, especially in these very, very vulnerable communities.” “How have you seen the deportation working in the last three weeks since Trump has taken over?” “So talking to people in Arizona, talking to ICE agents also, it’s caused a lot of fear. Some of the ICE agents are very frustrated, also, because they feel that they’re put on to make an artificial quota, that they first were sent to go after hard-core criminals, and now they’re kind of being pushed to just grab anybody. So, for example, in Arizona, they have a quota of 75 people per day. The frustration, I think, is also in the fact that there isn’t really any coordination of need. So for example, they’re bringing investigators off A.T.F., D.E.A., and HSI who are actually going after real criminals, both U.S. citizen and non-U.S. citizens, and they’re just being thrown in here to essentially do a show of force. And so it’s a frustration on both sides, too. They have families that are living in fear because there’s no real communications happening from ICE. And there’s the actual agents themselves feel like this is not a good use of my time, nor taxpayer dollar, for security. And so I think if Donald Trump actually wanted to get rid of these hard-core criminals, there is an actual way to do this, where you would have a lot of these undocumented families that have been here forever, the ones that have kids that are here, that will likely help you. But when you kind of are trying to cast a wide net, you’re going to have everyone hide, and you’re going to end up probably making a lot of these criminals that are here illegally be able to get away with it.” “Do you take Donald Trump and his administration at face value that what they’re interested in doing is deporting criminals, as opposed to deporting immigrants?” “No, I don’t take it at face value. This is why where can we have our points of leverage to have them focus on that is going to be the harder question. Because right now, with this election, we basically hand them the keys to everything. So what can we do to actually make them focus on these hard-core criminals is going to be the next, really, the big fight.” “As you’ve discussed, there are concerns about Democrats being too deferential to the more liberal parts of the party. Yes, on immigration, but also gender, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, D.E.I., whatever it is. And these are all things that the right has been hammering Democrats on for a while, and it seems to be working. So how do Democrats stand for what they believe in without being seen by voters as being outside of the mainstream?” “Well, I think the first problem is it’s easier for us to be hit as being extremist if we’re not also known for something. If we’re not fighting to make someone’s life better, to minimize or bring down the cost of living, raise wages — if we’re not actively fighting for that, it’s going to be easier for people to take the most extreme positions and say, Well, that’s actually what the Democrats are, right? I think most Americans are actually very much pro-L.G.B.T. I think they are pro-women’s rights. I think they’re more aligned with Democrats than what the Republicans are. But when we aren’t identified as at the core of doing something for the kind of grander America, they’re just going to be able to like, See? They’re just so focused on these small little niche groups instead of you. And that resonated. But again, we need to recognize that when Democrats fail, when we fail in making people’s lives better — and I know, again, someone’s going to go — I don’t know if you have blogs attached to this podcast. You’re going to say, Well, the G.D.P. under Biden was the highest and we had the lowest unemployment ever. Ruben Gallego is wrong. Yes, that was all true. But people were not feeling it. People were just not feeling it. And again, if we want to lie to ourselves and say, Well, things were really good, the economy was really good, when people were telling us it was not, we’re going to continue having this problem. And it’s going to be easier for people to take opportunities to take away some of these basic rights if we allow the middle of America to continue to suffer economically.” “Senator Ruben Gallego, thank you very much.” “Thank you.” [THEME MUSIC]</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/15/autossell/15TheInterview_YouTube/15TheInterview_YouTube-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The Arizona lawmaker diagnoses what he thinks needs to change in the way his party communicates with men, Latinos and Trump voters.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>I almost don’t know where to start, because so much has happened in such a short amount of time. You’re a first-term senator, but you were in the House during the first Trump administration. Does this time feel different? </strong>It does. A lot of what you see Trump doing now is what he tried the first time around. But this time, we don’t have Republican allies. We’re basically fighting on our own.</p><p><strong>Do you see a shift in how seriously the party is taking this moment?</strong> I do think that the party, at least talking to my colleagues, are starting to see that this is an existential threat if they keep going down this road. If we can’t rely on the judiciary to be part of those checks and balances, then what is left? What I’m seeing is a lot of people that are just kind of frozen. It’s something that happens when situations come out of the norm. People want to make something that’s not normal, normal, because if you actually have to accept the reality, it gets very, very scary.</p><p><strong>The big question for Democrats is what it means to be an effective opposition party, and I think there are two issues here. One is what Democrats should actually do to counter Trump’s actions. And the other is how you communicate what you’re doing. On the first, there is talk of using government spending, which has to be negotiated by March 14, as leverage. The risk is that if there is a government shutdown, the Democrats will be blamed for that at a moment when the party is trying to reach voters, rebuild itself and communicate that it is a party worth voting for. Is the risk too high? </strong>The risk is always there. We can’t be afraid of failing. I think that’s the biggest mistake I’ve seen Democrats make. We’re always afraid of failing, so we don’t take risks. It’s OK for us to recognize that that is a potential fallback. But we could also be working to mitigate it. What does that look like? Making sure that we meet the moment where the American public is. Making sure that we’re showing them that we’re the ones that are trying to, No. 1, protect the Constitution. No. 2, fighting for you. Because all this BS that’s happening right now? Prices are still high. The cost of eggs is still high. People can’t buy homes. We need to figure out how to pivot back, because that’s where the Republicans are the weakest. They own this economy now, and they’re not doing … stuff for everyday Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/15/magazine/15mag-interview-gallego-04/15mag-interview-gallego-04-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/15/magazine/15mag-interview-gallego-04/15mag-interview-gallego-04-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/15/magazine/15mag-interview-gallego-04/15mag-interview-gallego-04-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/15/magazine/15mag-interview-gallego-04/15mag-interview-gallego-04-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/15/magazine/15mag-interview-gallego-04/15mag-interview-gallego-04-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/15/magazine/15mag-interview-gallego-04/15mag-interview-gallego-04-jumbo.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/15/magazine/15mag-interview-gallego-04/15mag-interview-gallego-04-superJumbo.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1920w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/8daca56b-07a4-5275-92da-226ad7296d36" decoding="async" width="600" height="338"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ruben Gallego serving in the Marines in Iraq in 2005.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">From Senator Ruben Gallego</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><strong>I could see you in your brain changing the word. </strong>My wife warned me before I left for work today not to swear. [Laughs.]<strong> </strong>The problem is we have to separate what we’re hearing from the D.C. crowd from what we’re hearing in the streets. I go back to Arizona — they’re actually not talking about USAID. And they’re not talking about the courts. They’re still talking about egg prices. They’re still talking about the cost of everything. So one of the things we have to be very mindful of is that we may engage in a fight, but the rest of the American public may not be with us because they don’t understand this fight. And we need to make sure that we’re matching our politics to what actually is happening in the real world, because sometimes when we have that disconnect, we miss really, really badly. And unfortunately, now we know, we can’t miss. The stuff that’s happening right now is because we entirely missed where the American public was during the 2024 election.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>You outperformed Harris in your state, meaning that you won over some Trump voters. Why do you think that happened? </strong>Because I understand that not all Trump voters are actual straight-down-the-line Trump voters. I think there are a lot of people that voted for Trump because they were frustrated with what was happening in this country, and we weren’t afraid to reach out to them. We went to some of the hardest places in the state. We sat down with Trump supporters. We weren’t afraid to talk to them.</p><p><strong>You think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters?</strong> I think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters. I think Democrats are afraid to talk to people that are going to criticize them. In a state like Arizona, there are 300,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats. I had no choice. It was either do it, or you’re not going to make it.</p><p><strong><em>Why </em></strong><strong>do you think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters?</strong> I don’t know. Why aren’t they going into the reddest areas of the country? Donald Trump goes to Harlem. Do we go to the equivalent of Harlem for the red voter? No, we don’t.</p></div></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-9"><figure><figcaption><div><h3>Listen to the Conversation With Ruben Gallego</h3><p><span>The Arizona lawmaker diagnoses what he thinks needs to change in the way his party communicates with men, Latinos and Trump voters.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><strong>I want to talk through some demographic groups that Democrats really need to win back if they want to be competitive. </strong>Everybody?</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Men, for example.</strong> Yep.</p><p><strong>You’ve been described to me as a bro. And not in a bad way.</strong> [Laughs.]</p><p><strong>You won Latino men by 30 points in an election in which Trump dominated that group. I know men are a very broad group, but what do you think Democrats have misunderstood about them?</strong> That we could be working to make the status of men better without diminishing the status of women. A lot of times we forget that we still need men to vote for us. That’s how we still win elections. But we don’t really talk about making the lives of men better, working to make sure that they have wages so they can support their families. I also think some of this is purely psychological — like we just can’t put our finger on it. During my campaign, I noticed when I was talking to men, especially Latino men, about the feeling of pride, bringing money home, being able to support your family, the feeling of bringing security — they wanted to hear that someone understood that need. And a lot of times we are so afraid of communicating that to men, because we think somehow we’re going to also diminish the status of women. That’s going to end up being a problem. The fact that we don’t talk this way to them makes them think we don’t really care about them, when in fact the Democrats on par are actually very good about the status of working-class men. It was a joke, but I said a lot when I was talking to Latino men: “I’m going to make sure you get out of your mom’s house, get your <em>troquita</em>.” For English speakers, that means your truck. Every Latino man wants a big-ass truck, which, nothing wrong with that. “And you’re gonna go start your own job, and you’re gonna become rich, right?” These are the conversations that we should be having. We’re afraid of saying, like, “Hey, let’s help you get a job so you can become rich.” We use terms like “bring more economic stability.” These guys don’t want that. They don’t want “economic stability.” They want to really live the American dream.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gallego at the Juntos por Arizona (Together for Arizona) Rodeo, a campaign event that he hosted in Phoenix in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Noble/AFP, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>One of the difficulties for Democrats is that what you’re describing are more traditional values. </strong>But people vote on values!</p><p><strong>Are you saying that Democrats should recognize that people want more traditional gender roles? Be less afraid of that?</strong> No, I think Democrats should recognize that people want to understand that they matter. It doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to say the single mom is less important than the father. That’s not what we’re saying. But just saying, “Yes, you matter too.&#34; Because as Democrats, we’re supposed to be fighting for everybody.</p><p><strong>After the midterms in 2022, when Democrats did better than expected, many Democrats, you included, seemed to take away that there wasn’t this rightward shift among the Latino community. In fact, you said, and I’m quoting here, “There’s no effing realignment.” </strong><em>You</em> said “effing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>I said “effing.” That’s not the word you used. Why did you get it wrong?</strong> I was right <em>then</em>. In 2022 — this is when I was the head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus — we had polling that showed that there was no slippage happening because men, especially Latino men, were frustrated, but they felt that things were getting better. And there was also an understanding, especially from women, that Democrats were better for them. With the recession — the personal recession, not necessarily the government’s recession — continuing on more and more and with housing prices not going down, that’s when things just started sliding. Economically, we weren’t meeting the demands of where they were. I think they were willing to be hopeful because Biden had just gotten in. A lot of the stimulus money still had not worn out. But starting around early 2023, a lot of the stimulus money went away, because we negotiated with the Republicans for it to go away. Interest rates stayed high. And for a lot of families, Latino families, buying a home is part of the American dream. And now it has gotten even further and further away. So the economics just did not improve. And as soon as some of us heard it, we started putting up the warning signs. But it just wasn’t heard.</p><p>What else is the difference is that the way Trump communicates is actually more apt to get younger Latino men voters, because where they gather their information, where they listen to politics, is where Trump is more often, versus where we are. He’s on podcasts all the time. He’s at U.F.C. fights. He’s at all these things where they actually see him being a real quote unquote man. I also warned Democrats about that. We needed to get out there. I had a lot of recommendations that weren’t listened to. I wanted President Biden to go to the Copa America game and sit next to some Latino celebrity. I love boxing. I’m like: “Let’s go to some boxing matches, right? Let’s take some Democrats to boxing matches where a lot of Latinos are.” We need to figure out how to get into that world.</p><p><strong>I was shocked to learn that President Trump was the first sitting president to go to a Super Bowl game. That seems to me like a gimme for any president to go and do that. </strong>Yeah, and he’ll do everything. And why are we not doing it? I’ll tell you why, because I have heard this before. I’m not gonna tell you which politician was worried about this, but their staff told me, “I don’t want my guy getting booed.” So you don’t expose yourself to anybody. But then you also don’t expose yourself to anybody! And again, this is not just the president. This is everybody really running last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Montgomery for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p><strong>I </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/magazine/jd-vance-interview.html" title="">interviewed JD Vance</a></strong><strong> before the election, and it struck me that even though your politics are obviously very different, your backgrounds share some similar traits. Working class, raised by single mothers, military service in Iraq, went to the Ivy League. And that story of class transition does seem to resonate with voters.</strong> I think most voters want to believe and do believe in the American dream. I think when they see examples of that being true, that gives them some hope. And sometimes people miss that. I remember during my campaign, some of my advisers said, “You can’t talk about Harvard.” I’m like, “Why not?” “Well, you want working-class people to like you. If you tell them you went to Harvard, you’re going to remind them that you’re not part of that.” I’m like: “No, you’re not getting it. Working-class people appreciate kids going to college, especially kids that came from poverty going to college, because that’s part of the American dream. You need that kind of hope to hang on to, to get through those hard days, knowing that things will get better.” This is psychologically what people missed about this campaign: when people started feeling like it’s not going to get better. That should have been a big tell that things were going to go south.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p><strong>Something I really struggle to reconcile is: On the one hand, you have voters saying that the economy and inflation are their top issues, and they feel the pain of price increases, which is completely understandable. On the other hand, under Trump, we now have the richest cabinet in modern history. The world’s richest person is gutting the federal government. Yet polls show the president starting his second term with higher approval ratings than when he began his first term. It sends this confusing message about what the electorate actually wants.</strong> I don’t think so.</p><p><strong>Why don’t you think it’s a confusing message?</strong> Because people that are working class, poor, don’t necessarily look at the ultrarich as their competitors. They want to be rich someday. And so they don’t necessarily fault the rich for being rich. Where they do fault them is when it starts affecting them. So they’re going to give Elon and his little weirdos the benefit of the doubt, and they’re going to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt until it proves that it’s actually affecting them personally. The thing that finally started moving Donald Trump’s numbers away, before the 2018 elections, was when he gave a massive tax cut to the rich. So, I think that’s what’s going to end up happening. I think this administration is going to give a massive tax cut to the rich, and they’re going to do it by cutting Medicaid and other programs for the poor, and that’s when you’re going to see people saying, “No, no, no, that’s not what I want.”</p><p><strong>So the message among some Democrats of “Eat the rich” — </strong>That’s not going to work. These people want to be rich. They want to be rich! And there’s nothing wrong with that. Our job is to expose when there are abuses by the rich, the wealthy, the powerful. That’s how we get those people that aspire to that to vote for Democrats.</p><p><strong>So Elon Musk, Donald Trump: Are these the people who have actually figured out how to connect with the working class? </strong>Yes. We just had an election that proved that.</p><p><strong>Why? </strong>They actually understand the consumer. They are engaged every day, one way or the other, in trying to talk to the consumer, and in this case it’s the voter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>They’re salesmen. </strong>Yeah, exactly. The client is the voter. He knows where the voter is, and he’ll get there however he can get there.</p><p><strong>I want to ask you specifically about immigration, which was one of the central issues of the election and one that really hurt Democrats. Your first vote as a senator was for the </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/senate-passes-border-crackdown-bill.html" title="">Laken Riley Act</a></strong><strong>. You were one of two Democratic co-sponsors of the bill — the other one being John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. Many in the immigrant-advocacy community were unhappy with that position. They have criticized the law. They say it raises due-process concerns for immigrants. Another big concern is that it will give states more control over immigration policy, essentially gutting federal authority. What was your thinking behind voting for it?</strong> Well, my thinking behind voting for it the <em>second </em>time, because I voted for it also in the House of Representatives, is that talking to voters — they wanted more immigration control and reform. What happened to Laken Riley was horrible. And look: These immigration groups have some very valid points in some areas. But where they’re moving is not necessarily in line with where the majority of voters or even the immigrant community are. I heard from them a lot, and the one thing I heard from them is: “This is not what Latinos want. They don’t want this bill.” I’m like, “That’s actually not true. I go home, and there is a lot of support for bills like this.” There’s a mismatch right now. The immigration groups have moved to a point where they say that they represent the voice of Latinos, and they don’t. They’re not even close. One of the things I’ve been telling senators is: Listen to the immigration groups, because they have good legal advice. Do not listen to immigration groups if they tell you that this is a representation of where Latinos are, because they are totally off.</p><p><strong>This bill, though, does seem to want to change the nature of how immigration is done in this country. And the architect of this administration’s immigration policy is Stephen Miller, who in the past has promoted hard-line views by citing the work of white-nationalist websites, </strong><strong><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/stephen-miller/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a></strong><strong> to the Southern Poverty Law Center. There does seem to be a strain in this administration that wants to change the makeup of this country. </strong>Without a doubt.</p><p><strong>Do you worry that voters’ legitimate concerns about our immigration system are being weaponized for ideological ends? </strong>Absolutely. But this isn’t new.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p><strong>Was it hard for you to cast that vote knowing that context?</strong> No, because this has been happening for the last 20 years. The context that I worry about is how do we get the trust of people back to the point where we can actually bring the immigration conversation to a more normal frame. When the Democrats basically dropped the ball on the chaos on the border for many years, we essentially lost the debate on immigration reform for years, because the everyday voter doesn’t trust us. For years they saw that chaos on the border, and we did nothing. The Biden administration finally moved, but by then it had been so long and the damage had been done. And by the way, for those of us that care about immigration reform, and we truly do — I want to see undocumented families come out of the shadows; I want Dreamers to become citizens — we’ve been set back for years because we hesitated on asylum seekers when we knew in our guts that what was happening there was an abuse of the system, was unpopular with Democrats, but somehow we decided that we were going to essentially just give the issue to the Republicans. We could have had a very sane position on this.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gallego speaking to reporters after a vote to proceed with the Laken Riley Act in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Rose Layden/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p><strong>Do you blame President Biden for that? </strong>I blame President Biden, but I also blame a lot of the people that were advising President Biden. A lot of these groups. You’re only as good as the advice that’s given to you. These immigration groups that I think <em>are</em> looking out for people ended up making the situation a lot worse.</p><p><strong>Just to understand where you stand on specific issues: Should local law enforcement be helping ICE carry out deportations? </strong>No, because if you talk to local law enforcement, and especially in Arizona, talking to sheriffs and talking to the police, they don’t have the bandwidth. They don’t want to do this. They want to keep the community relationships. And police are there to actually enforce local laws.</p><p><strong>Should migrants be sent to Guantánamo or to prisons in El Salvador? </strong>Not migrants that have their due process, and especially not ones that aren’t dangerous, but certainly ones that are severely dangerous, like people that have committed crimes but we can’t legally hold them here.

Why would we want to keep gang members and criminals that don’t even have a legal right to be here and Venezuela won’t take them back?</p><p><strong>I think there is a concern that people that get put into these systems — it’s sort of like a black hole. It’s a legal limbo. </strong>I mean, we’ve been having legal limbo for the immigrant community forever. Guantánamo has been used for refugees and asylum seekers prior to this.</p><p><strong>But not ones that have been in the United States. They’re people who have been caught at sea — </strong>I see what you’re saying. Yeah. Look, at the same time, if there is a hard-core criminal that has gone through our judicial system but we can’t actually deport, what are we going to do? I’m not saying we do this for everybody, but there has to be some logical security that we should be thinking about, because they’re going to end up being criminals again, especially in these very, very vulnerable communities.</p><p><strong>How have you seen the deportations working in the weeks since Trump has taken over? </strong>Talking to people in Arizona, talking to ICE agents, it’s caused a lot of fear. Some of the ICE agents are very frustrated, because they feel that they’re put on to make an artificial quota. That they first were sent to go after hard-core criminals, and now they’re being pushed to just grab anybody. So, for example, in Arizona, they have a quota of 75 people per day. The frustration, I think, is also in the fact that there just isn’t really any coordination of need. So, for example, they’re bringing investigators off A.T.F., D.E.A. and H.S.I., who are actually going after real criminals, both U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens, and they’re just being thrown in here to essentially do a show of force.</p><p><strong>You think it’s ineffective? </strong>I think if Donald Trump actually wanted to get rid of these hard-core criminals, there is a way to do this, where you would have a lot of these undocumented families — the ones I’ve told you that have been here forever, the ones that have kids that are here — that will likely help you. But when you are trying to cast a wide net, you’re going to have everyone hide. And you’re going to end up probably making a lot of these criminals that are here illegally be able to get away with it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p><strong>Do you take Donald Trump and his administration at face value that what they’re interested in doing is deporting criminals as opposed to deporting immigrants? </strong>No, I don’t. What can we do to actually make them focus on these hard-core criminals is going to be the next really big fight.</p><p><strong>As we’ve discussed, there are concerns about Democrats being too deferential to the more liberal parts of the party — yes, on immigration, but also gender, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, D.E.I., whatever it is. These are all things the right has been hammering Democrats on for a while, and it seems to be working. So how do Democrats stand for what they believe in without being seen by voters as outside the mainstream? </strong>It’s easier for us to be hit as being extremists if we’re not also known for something, if we’re not fighting to make someone’s life better, to bring down the cost of living, raise wages. If we’re not actively fighting for that, it’s going to be easier for people to take the most extreme positions and say, “Well, that’s actually what the Democrats are.” I think most Americans are very much pro-L.G.B.T. I think they are pro-women’s rights. I think they’re more aligned with Democrats than with where Republicans are. But when we aren’t identified as doing something for the grander America, they’re just going to be able to say, “They’re just so focused on these small little niche groups instead of you.” And that resonated.</p><p>I know someone’s going to say: “Well, the G.D.P. under Biden was the highest. And we had the lowest unemployment ever. Ruben Gallego is wrong.” Yes, that was all true. But people were not feeling it. People were just not feeling it. If we want to lie to ourselves and say, “Well, things were really good, the economy was really good” when people were telling us it was not, we’re going to continue having this problem. It’s going to be easier for people to take away some of these basic rights if we allow the middle of America to continue to suffer economically.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed.
