It comes as universities across the country brace this commencement season for pro-Palestinian speeches and displays from students and for the anger that pro-Israel voices often express in response.</p><p>John Beckman, an N.Y.U. spokesman, said in a <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2025/may/statement-by-nyu-spokesperson-john-beckman.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> Wednesday that the university “strongly denounces” Mr. Rozos’ decision to express “his personal and one-sided political views.”</p><p>The student “lied about the speech he was going to deliver and violated the commitment he made to comply with our rules,” Mr. Beckman said, adding that the university would withhold his diploma as it pursues disciplinary actions against him. That means that Mr. Rozos would not officially be considered graduated until the matter is resolved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“N.Y.U. is deeply sorry that the audience was subjected to these remarks and that this moment was stolen by someone who abused a privilege that was conferred upon him,” Mr. Beckman added.</p><p>Mr. Rozos, 24, was not immediately available for comment.</p><p>Pro-Palestinian activism has diminished on campuses this academic year, in part because of stricter enforcement of disciplinary rules. N.Y.U. has been especially forceful in confronting such activism, including by barring more than two dozen law students from entering some university buildings after they held a sit-in outside of President Linda Mills’s office in March, the <a href="https://nyunews.com/news/2025/03/05/law-students-bobst-sit-in/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">student newspaper reported</a>.</p><p>Mr. Rozos’ speech took place at the graduation ceremony of the <a href="https://gallatin.nyu.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gallatin School</a>, a small liberal arts school within the university. N.Y.U.’s universitywide commencement ceremony was held Thursday at Yankee Stadium.</p><p>His roughly two-and-a-half minute speech included four sentences that referred to the bloodshed in Gaza. Video of the event showed that he appeared nervous as he began his remarks, saying he had “been freaking out a lot about this speech, honestly.”</p><p>“The only thing that is appropriate to say in this time and to a group this large is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening in Palestine,” he began. A huge cheer erupted from the audience of hundreds at the graduation, held at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He continued by charging that “the genocide currently occurring is supported politically and militarily by the United States, is paid for by our tax dollars and has been livestreamed to our phones for the last 18 months.” He added that he hoped to speak for “all people who feel the moral injury of this atrocity.” Shouts that seemed to oppose the speech erupted as Mr. Rozos was concluding, as he condemned “this genocide and complicity in this genocide.”</p><p>Following his remarks, pro-Palestinian voices on social media praised the speech, while pro-Israel voices condemned it.</p><p>“We commend Logan for using this opportunity to demand an end to the bloodshed in Gaza,” said Afaf Nasher, executive director of CAIR-NY, a Muslim civil rights organization. “We demand that N.Y.U. formally release Logan’s diploma, which he rightfully earned, and suspend any disciplinary proceedings against him.”</p><p>Scott Richman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization focused on antisemitism, said the A.D.L. was “appalled” by the speech. “We are thankful to the N.Y.U. administration for their strong condemnation and their pursuit of disciplinary action,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Rozos identifies himself in <a href="https://www.firelightmedia.tv/filmmakers/logan-rozos" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">professional biographies</a> as “an actor, artist, and gay Black trans man&#34; as well as an <a href="https://parity.nyc/logan-rozos" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">advocate</a> for L.G.B.T.Q. people. He made his acting debut in “David Makes Man,” a 2019 television series.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Beekeeper Charged With a Genocidal Secret:</strong> Faustin Nsabumukunzi lived quietly in New York.
