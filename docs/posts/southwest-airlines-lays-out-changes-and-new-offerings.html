It also announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and plans for operational changes, including turning planes around faster and finding ways to save on costs.</p><p>“We’re now ushering in a new era at Southwest, moving swiftly and deliberately to transform the company,” Bob Jordan, the airline’s chief executive, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Southwest shares jumped more than 9 percent after the announcement, which came ahead of a day of events the airline scheduled for investors and analysts.</p><p>The airline is making the moves under rising pressure from an activist hedge fund, Elliott Management, which has amassed a stake of more than 10 percent, worth almost $2 billion. Elliott has said the airline is underperforming and has placed blame on Mr. Jordan, who has worked at the airline for decades.</p><p>The hedge fund contends that Southwest can better contain rising costs and improve profit margins. To do that, Elliott says, the airline needs new board members and a new chief executive. The hedge fund plans to call for a shareholder meeting as soon as next week to vote on candidates it has proposed for the airline’s board, mostly former industry executives.</p><p>Southwest in response has accused Elliott of failing to “engage constructively” with the airline. On Thursday, the airline also said that it had appointed a new board member, Robert Fornaro, the former chief executive of both Spirit Airlines and AirTran, which Southwest acquired more than a decade ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elliott Management has called for the replacement of Bob Jordan as Southwest’s chief executive.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Southwest once reported strong profits consistently even as other airlines lost money and sought bankruptcy protection. But its financial results in recent years have disappointed some investors, who point to airlines that have adapted more quickly to shifting market demand by, for example, selling more premium seats.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Jordan has acknowledged that the airline needs to make some changes. The airline is in the middle of rolling out better internet service, in-seat power outlets and larger overhead bins.</p><p>But it is not clear whether Southwest, which has become one of the world’s biggest airlines by being different, can now do well by acting a little more like other airlines.</p><p>“They don’t need to become another legacy airline,” said Savanthi Syth, a Raymond James Financial analyst. “They just need to adapt, and they need to differentiate themselves.”</p><p>Other carriers have spent the past two decades redesigning their planes, fares and policies. Unlike Southwest, many airlines now charge bag fees and offer restrictive basic economy fares to bargain hunters and premium seats to more affluent travelers. Those changes are widely credited with helping airlines make more money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Southwest made changes, too, such as selling priority boarding, but it sat out much of that industry evolution. Southwest lost a competitive edge in recent years, after other airlines dropped most change fees.</p><p>Now it’s trying to catch up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Southwest plans operational changes, including turning planes around faster and finding ways to save on costs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kendrick Brinson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Southwest provided more detail on Thursday about the changes it announced over the summer. The airline said that surveys showed that four of every five customers wanted assigned seats, which it will start selling next year for flights in 2026. The airline said it would also start offering red-eye flights in February. It also defended its policy of allowing every passenger to bring two free checked bags, which it described as a competitive advantage.</p><p>The company, which flies almost entirely within the United States, has many things going for it. It still earns consistent if not always stellar profits. It has little debt and the lowest operating costs of any of the four large U.S. airlines. It also consistently earns top ratings from travelers: Southwest ranked highest in customer satisfaction among people flying in economy or basic economy classes, according to <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-north-america-airline-satisfaction-study" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent J.D. Power report</a>.</p><p>But critics say Southwest has failed to capitalize on those strengths and adapt to a changing industry. Its stock is sagging. For most of the past decade, it has delivered the lowest earnings per share of the four large airlines, which include American, Delta and United. Its revenue is growing more slowly than those rivals, and it has struggled in recent years to keep costs in check, once a defining strength of the business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In other words, critics say, the once-scrappy airline has grown complacent.</p><p>Those problems presented an opportunity to Elliott, which is led by the billionaire investor Paul Singer. In June, Elliott announced its stake in the company and accused Southwest’s executives of letting investors down but said there was time to get the company back on track.</p><p>“We are convinced that Southwest represents the most compelling airline turnaround opportunity in the last two decades,” Elliott said at the time in a letter to Southwest’s board. “The significant investment we have made reflects our conviction that, with the right leadership, Southwest can regain its status as an industry-leading airline.”</p><p>Elliott said it had based its conclusions on 18 months of research and conversations with more than 130 former Southwest employees and airline industry executives. Once revamped, the airline’s stock could reach $49 a share within a year, a nearly 77 percent return, Elliott said. Southwest&#39;s share price was just over $31 on Thursday morning.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
