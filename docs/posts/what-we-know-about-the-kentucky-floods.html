That year, entire homes in eastern Kentucky were washed away. Over the weekend, more than 170 members of the state’s National Guard, along with search-and-rescue crews from Kentucky, Ohio, North Carolina and Indiana, were called in to help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/us/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/us/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/us/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Lines of homes sit in high waters." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/us/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/us/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/us/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/us/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3/17nat-wwk-kentucky-3-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c4ebcf9e-7c50-5d21-a984-42b82a3da7b3" decoding="async" width="600" height="480"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Homes in Coal Run, Ky., on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jared Hamilton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-2"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shania Lewis pointed to a line on the wall of her home, in Coal Run, Ky., where the floodwaters reached.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jared Hamilton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Now the region is bracing for a cold front and even more precipitation — this time in the form of snow.

Snow that already coated much of the state melted, adding to the deluge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>City workers removed a thick layer of mud from streets in Hazard, Ky., on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jared Hamilton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Frost-lined boot prints in Neon, Ky., on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Cherry/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-1353ba80">How has the storm affected the area?</h2><p>The storm has contributed to the deaths of at least 11 people in Kentucky, Mr. Beshear said. Hundreds more have been displaced from their homes, he said, and more than 14,000 customers are without power. He added that there have been more than 1,000 rescues, at least 300 roads are closed and seven wastewater systems are out of service. The extent of the damage has not been as extensive as it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/29/us/kentucky-floods-impacts.html" title="">in 2022</a>, when at least 45 people were killed.</p><h2 id="link-6aa77bcb">What part of Kentucky was hit the hardest?</h2><p>The storm dealt its strongest blow to an area that was largely spared in the 2022 floods: Pike County, on the eastern side of the state, beside its border with West Virginia and Virginia. In those neighboring states, about 40,000 customers were without power Monday afternoon, <a href="https://poweroutage.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Poweroutage.us</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers surrounded a vehicle on Sunday that had fallen from a cliff near the North Fork Kentucky River.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Cherry/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Perry County Senior Center was used as a temporary shelter on Sunday for those displaced by flooding in Hazard.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Cherry/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2b2eb05a">How has severe weather affected the area in recent years?</h2><p>From tornadoes to mudslides and floods — and more floods, one climate disaster after another has pounded Kentucky. Over the last four years, flooding in eastern Kentucky has killed more than 50 people. In December 2022, tornadoes on the western side of the state <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2022/02/21/kentucky-tornado-death-toll-rises-80-people/6885384001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">left 80 dead</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The toll from this flood will be felt for a long time, but Governor Beshear said the state was better prepared for this storm than for some previous storms. Officials received better forecasts and residents got improved local warnings compared with those of 2022, he said. Emergency responders were deployed before the storm hit, allowing for quicker response times, according to the governor.</p><p>“We knew this was coming,” Mr. Beshear said.</p><h2 id="link-38a42287">Why is this happening?</h2><p>While the effects of climate change on the Appalachian region are still being studied, researchers at the University of Kentucky believe that increasing amounts of rain and snow are overwhelming the region’s moist, thin soil type. With soil that is unable to absorb all the excess water, streams and rivers become more likely to overflow, and flat areas experience pooling and flooding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Debris clung to a fence in Hazard, Ky., as floodwaters receded on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jared Hamilton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sandy Hurt washed mud on Sunday from shelves that were flooded in Appalachian Quilt and Yarn in Hazard.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Cherry/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“It’s hard to answer the why,” Governor Beshear said on Monday. “I think we know climate change is making more and more weather events happen, but we keep getting hit over and over.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-6f46a4eb">Will the area get a break anytime soon?</h2><p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t look likely. Governor Beshear warned that a snowstorm was expected in the next few days.</p><p>He told residents that their priority this week should be to stay warm. People who need help as temperatures drop, he said, should reach out to <a href="https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/aebe49078b9d484bb4db7a11254b60dd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noncritical emergency services</a> or go to one of the state’s <a href="https://www.kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=GovernorBeshear&amp;prId=2405" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shelters</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Juliet Macur is a national reporter at The Times, based in Washington, D.C., who often writes about America through the lens of sports.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
