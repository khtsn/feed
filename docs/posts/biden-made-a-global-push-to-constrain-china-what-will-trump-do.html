But over four years, they focused too on the Pacific, where China strains to be the dominant player. Their main effort: building up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/us/politics/biden-allies-foreign-policy.html" title="">alliances</a> to counter China.</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump has already signaled a different approach to China. He <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-invites-china-xi-jinping-inauguration/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invited</a> Xi Jinping, China’s leader, to his inauguration on Monday. The two spoke by phone on Friday, and Mr. Xi <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/17/china-donald-trump-inauguration/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is sending</a> China’s vice president, Han Zheng, to the ceremony, a break from China’s tradition of having its ambassador in Washington attend.</p><p>The Biden administration’s final activities aimed at China stand in contrast to that. Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/12/readout-of-president-bidens-call-with-prime-minister-ishiba-of-japan-and-president-marcos-of-the-philippines/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">held a call</a> last Sunday with the leaders of Japan and the Philippines to firm up a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/world/asia/china-biden-camp-david.html" title="">three-way security arrangement</a> he helped build. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/asia/south-korea-blinken-democracy-alliance.html" title="">visited</a> South Korea and Japan this month on his final official trip.</p><p>In the telling of Mr. Biden and his aides, they are handing Mr. Trump a sharpened competitive edge on China, the greatest rival to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Of all of Mr. Biden’s foreign policies, his approach to China could ultimately be seen by historians as existing in a continuum. His administration built its own structure on a foundation of competition laid by Mr. Trump’s team and is now turning it over.</p><p>It is unclear what Mr. Trump will do with that. He admires the autocratic Mr. Xi, and sees China mainly through the lens of economic negotiations. Mr. Trump’s billionaire advisers, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/musk-italy-iran-prisoner-exchange.html" title="">Elon Musk</a>, want to maintain and perhaps expand business dealings with China.</p><p>But his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/trump-cabinet-china-policy.html" title="">top picks</a> for foreign policy aides are more aligned with Mr. Biden: They <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/marco-rubio-senate-hearing-takeaways.html" title="">assert</a> that the United States must constrain China across many dimensions, and using the entire range of security and economic tools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President-elect Donald J.

Mr. Trump said Saturday that he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-likely-give-tiktok-90-day-extension-avoid-ban-rcna188258" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would likely give TikTok</a> a 90-day reprieve from the ban, and the company’s chief executive plans to attend his inauguration.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s signature China policy in his first term was placing tariffs on some Chinese goods. Mr. Biden and his aides kept those while expanding policy along three major prongs: strengthening alliances and creating new security partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region; limiting technology exports to China; and jump-starting industrial policy in the United States.</p><p>In short, Mr. Biden sought to turn China policy into global policy.</p><p>During Mr. Biden’s tenure, already-tense relations plummeted when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, the de facto independent island that China claims as its territory, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/us/politics/balloon-ufo-us-china.html" title="">Chinese spy balloon</a> drifted over the United States. But his team scrambled to restart high-level communications, including between the two militaries.</p><p>The United States and China “are competing, obviously competing vigorously, and yet still the relationship has an element of stability so that we’re not presently on the brink of a downward spiral,” Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said in an interview in a West Wing conference room.</p><p>“That is a significant evolution over four years for how the relationship is managed on both sides,” he added, using the acronym for the People’s Republic of China. The Chinese Communist Party, he said, has now accepted the Biden team’s framing of “managed competition” for the relationship.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The Biden administration was animated by the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-long-game-chinas-grand-strategy-to-displace-american-order/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">idea</a> that China <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wants to displace the United States</a> as the world’s dominant power, said Rush Doshi, a China director who served on the National Security Council earlier in the Biden administration. Many Republican lawmakers and policymakers share that view.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Chinese-made Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter during an air show in Zhuhai in November. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Coming into office, Mr. Biden and his aides saw huge gaps in critical areas, including the U.S. defense industrial base, Mr. Sullivan said.</p><p>The administration set up two “big tent poles” of policy, as he put it: investments aimed at rejuvenating American manufacturing, technology innovation and supply chains; and investments in alliances and partnerships, “so that we broaden China strategy to really be a regional and global strategy.”</p><p>Mr. Sullivan pointed to alliances not only in Asia, but in Europe as well. Mr. Biden’s team helped persuade European nations to back away from some commercial agreements with China, and NATO to make stronger pronouncements on China and to signal support for Taiwan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>China’s partnership with Russia during President Vladimir V. Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has helped push the Europeans in that direction, as have China’s cyberespionage efforts.</p><p>But the trans-Atlantic allies have not gone as far as the United States in viewing China as a threat. Some European politicians still prioritize trade relations with China, the world’s second-largest economy. And Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/world/europe/blinken-france-trump.html" title="">antagonizing of European nations</a> could jeopardize the Biden administration’s work.</p><p>Moreover, U.S. allies could run into the arms of China if Mr. Trump makes good on his threat to impose universal tariffs even on them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The port of Qingdao in China’s Shandong province in December. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Trump also says allies are leeching off the U.S. military, and that they must pay the United States for protection or fend for themselves. In Asia, this thinking would apply to Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, as well as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/taiwan-biden-weapons-china.html" title="">Taiwan</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Biden administration has had the opposite attitude. In creating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/us/politics/biden-japan-south-korea-sum.html" title="">a web of new security agreements</a> among U.S. allies in Asia, it tried to make their militaries more intertwined with each other and with that of the United States — which, according to Mr. Biden’s team, would help deter China.</p><p>Mr. Biden also moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/26/us/politics/us-china-military-bases-weapons.html" title="">bolster the military capacities</a> of several allies and the U.S. military presence in Asia: sending Tomahawk missiles to Japan; working with Britain to start equipping Australia with nuclear submarine technology, and the submarines themselves; and expanding the U.S. military’s access to Philippine bases near Taiwan.</p><p>In private conversations in Washington, Chinese officials complained that it was a policy of containment.</p><p>A central question, difficult to answer and relevant for Mr. Trump’s team, is whether the Biden administration struck the right balance between deterrence and provocation. Is China accelerating its military buildup, and is it becoming more aggressive in the region, because of the American moves in its backyard?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Beijing took notice when Mr. Biden said on four separate occasions that the U.S. military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/world/asia/biden-taiwan-china.html" title="">would defend Taiwan</a> in the event of a Chinese invasion.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taiwanese military personnel with a Patriot missile system earlier this month. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ritchie B Tongo/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Jessica Chen Weiss, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who worked briefly in the State Department under Mr. Blinken, noted that the administration’s policies didn’t ignite conflict, and that some of its diplomacy helped.</p><p>“It was able to avoid the extremes,” she said. “Whether or not that muddling through was ambitious enough to arrest the underlying tendencies remains to be seen.”</p><p>In summits, Mr. Xi directly criticized a signature Biden policy that Chinese officials insist is part of the containment effort: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/biden-china-technology-semiconductors.html" title="">export controls</a> imposed on advanced semiconductor chips, including the kind needed for developing artificial intelligence.</p><p>After rolling out the first tranche in 2022, Mr. Sullivan <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/27/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-renewing-american-economic-leadership-at-the-brookings-institution/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described it</a> as a policy of keeping “foundational technologies” out of the hands of rivals by establishing a “small yard, high fence.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Some experts argue the policy <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-americas-war-chinese-tech-backfired" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has backfired</a> and has actually pushed China to accelerate innovation. And the less Chinese companies rely on American technology, the less leverage the United States has over China, they say.</p><p>Mr. Sullivan said that criticism “gets the chronology wrong.”</p><p>“Our semiconductor export controls were actually a reaction to China’s very overtly, very systematically stated policy that they were going to indigenize their semiconductor manufacturing capability,” he said.</p><p>Some former officials point to other policy shortcomings. Ryan Hass, a China director on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, listed three: Mr. Biden and his team lacked a serious trade agenda for Asia, appeared timid in dealing with China, and seemed more comfortable interacting with advanced democracies on China policy than with developing nations.</p><p>But overall, he said, the policy worked: “America is in a stronger competitive position vis-à-vis China than it was when Biden entered office.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>His Legacy:</strong> After a tumultuous four years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/biden-presidential-legacy-trump.html">President Biden will end up in the history books</a> as an interregnum between two terms of Donald Trump, a break in the middle of a chaotic period of change.</p></li><li><p><strong>Farewell Address: </strong>Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/biden-farewell-address.html">warned that an “oligarchy” of the ultrawealthy was emerging in America</a>, sounding the alarm about unchecked power before surrendering office.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protecting a President: </strong>Biden’s family and inner circle <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/biden-age.html">recognized his physical frailty to a greater degree than they publicly acknowledged</a>.
