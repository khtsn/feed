But there are signs that the former president and his team are worried that their opponents’ descriptions of him as a racist and a fascist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trump-msg-rally-backlash.html" title="">may be breaking through to segments of voters</a>.</p><p>That anxiety was clear last night after Trump’s six-hour rally at Madison Square Garden. During the event, which was billed as his closing argument, opening speakers disparaged Latinos, Black people, Palestinians and Jews, and directed misogynistic comments at Kamala Harris. Several Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/puerto-rico-republicans-trump-msg-rally.html" title="">distanced themselves from one crude comment about Puerto Rico</a>, and Trump’s campaign disavowed it — a rare break from his typical ethos of never apologizing and never admitting error.</p><p>Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/28/us/harris-trump-election" title="">seized on the spectacle</a>. She accused him today of “trying to divide our country.” Her team has grown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-election.html" title="">cautiously optimistic about her chances of victory</a>, buoyed by her attacks on Trump, as well as by her strength among female voters.</p><p>In the past, Trump has paid little political price for inflammatory remarks. His campaign said it is more focused on what they believe is a small fraction of undecided voters — largely younger men — who could be persuaded to support Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>More from the campaign trail:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The Harris campaign has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/harris-biden-campaign.html" title="">distanced itself from President Biden</a> in the crucial final days.</p></li><li><p>Harris’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/upshot/polls-harris-trump-election.html" title="">lead in the national polls has dwindled</a>, but she remains competitive in the battlegrounds.</p></li><li><p>Trump’s vast tariff proposals would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trumps-tariffs-global-trade.html" title="">rock global businesses</a>.</p></li><li><p>No matter who wins, seeking asylum in the U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/harris-trump-asylum-immigration.html" title="">may never be the same</a>.</p></li><li><p>Republican activists are ready to challenge a Trump defeat.
