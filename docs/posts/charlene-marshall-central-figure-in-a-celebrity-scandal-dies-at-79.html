She was 79.</p><p>A representative from St. Jude’s Episcopal Church in Seal Harbor, Maine, where her funeral was held, confirmed the death but did not provide a cause.</p><p>The Astor case had all the makings of a New York celebrity scandal: an ailing matriarch beloved by the city’s elite for her social and philanthropic largess; an only son who had long lived in his mother’s shadow; a nine-figure inheritance; and a will that had been rewritten more than 45 times.</p><p>At issue was whether Mrs. Astor’s son, Anthony Marshall, had conspired with a lawyer, Francis Morrissey Jr., to revise the will to direct more money to himself, along the way forcing his mother, who had dementia and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/obituaries/14astor.html" title="">died</a> at 105 in 2007, to slash her expenses to keep her fortune intact.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But the heart of the case was the presence of Mrs. Marshall. She was neither named in the suit nor charged with the crime, but in some ways she was the one on trial.</p><p>She and Mr. Marshall, a decorated Marine and a former ambassador to several countries, married after they both left failing marriages in the late 1980s. That was a scandal in itself in the small town of Northeast Harbor, where the Astors had a summer home and where Mrs. Marshall’s former husband was the minister at Mrs. Astor’s church.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mrs. Marshall with her husband in 2006. They both left failing marriages in the late 1980s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bill Cunningham/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>First during the 2006 civil suit brought against Mr. Marshall by his twin sons, Alexander and Philip, accusing him of elder abuse, and later during the criminal trial in 2009, lawyers and reporters painted Mrs. Marshall in the worst possible light — as a gold digger, as a participant in the supposed abuse and as the primary drive behind Mr. Marshall’s actions.</p><p>“Anthony Marshall’s preoccupation for getting money for Charlene was actually motivation for the scheme to defraud,” Elizabeth Loewy, an assistant district attorney, said during the trial.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Things got worse in the papers: Reporters, especially those from The New York Post, picked up on Mrs. Astor’s rumored dislike for Mrs. Marshall, including unflattering descriptions of her body, fashion sense and lack of social standing among the moneyed elite. Those rumors were underlined by a retinue of witnesses, including maids, butlers and a list of famous names long enough to fill the tabloid’s Page Six for a month.</p><p>“Charlene Marshall has not been charged with a crime — unless it’s illegal to be unpopular,” The rival Daily News wrote.</p><p>None of the allegations were ever proved. But because Mrs. Marshall was not charged and was not called to testify, she had no opportunity to rebut them. Instead she sat in the audience behind her husband, day after day, sometimes with tears in her eyes.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mrs. Marshall in 2009.

What part have I played in this? What’s in me that has caused this reaction from others?”</p></div><div><div><p>The Marshalls insisted on their innocence; it was one reason, their friends said, that Mr. Marshall never negotiated a plea deal (though, as others pointed out, that would have most likely cut out his chances of any inheritance).</p><p>Mr. Marshall entered the Downstate Correctional Facility in Beacon, N.Y., in 2013 but, suffering from Parkinson’s and congestive heart failure, was released after eight weeks on medical parole. He retained a sizable sum of his mother’s fortune, including her summer home in Maine, and the couple went to live there after the trial. He <a href="https://nytimes.com/2014/12/02/nyregion/anthony-d-marshall-son-of-brooke-astor-convicted-in-swindle-dies-at-90.html" title="">died</a> in 2014.</p><p>The trial left a rift in New York society, splitting those who believed the couple had taken advantage of Mrs. Astor’s dementia and those who believed that they (especially Mrs. Marshall) had themselves been abused by a social elite whose defense of Mrs. Astor was in large part motivated by self-interest.</p><p>“No one is as bad as their worst headline, and Charlene was no exception,” Alexander Hoyt, a literary agent who advised the couple, said in an interview. “Charlene was a very good wife who stood by her man.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>First during a civil suit brought against Mr. Marshall by his twin sons and later during a criminal trial, lawyers and reporters painted Mrs. Marshall in the worst possible light.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Charlene Detwiler Tyler was born on July 28, 1945, in Charleston, S.C., to Marguerite and Charles Taylor. Her father was an insurance actuary. Though her family was solidly middle class, it had illustrious roots, counting President John Tyler and the painter George Inness among its ancestors.</p></div><div><div><p>She married Paul Gilbert, an Episcopal minister, in 1968. After living briefly in New Jersey, they settled on Mount Desert Island, in Maine, where he joined the clergy at St. Mary’s-by-the Sea church in the town of Northeast Harbor. Mrs. Astor was among its tight-knit congregation.</p><p>Mr. Marshall was Mrs. Astor’s only son, from her first marriage, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/06/dryden-kuser-66-jersey-aide-dies.html" title="">J. Dryden Kuser</a>; he later took the surname of her second husband, Charles Marshall, who died in 1952. A year later, she married Vincent Astor, the heir to the fortune of John Jacob Astor. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1959/02/04/archives/vincent-astor-dies-in-his-home-at-67-vincent-astor-dies-here-at-67.html" title="">died</a> in 1959.</p><p>The Marshalls met in Maine; though later news media accounts accused her of stalking him and seducing him into leaving his wife, the couple later said that both their marriages had been falling apart. She left Mr. Gilbert in 1989 and married Mr. Marshall in 1992.</p><p>Mrs. Marshall is survived by her children from her first marriage, Arden Delacey, Robert Gilbert and Inness Hancock, as well as several grandchildren.</p></div></div><div><div><p>For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, the Marshalls were part of Manhattan’s elite scene, appearing in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/style/bill-cunningham-legendary-times-fashion-photographer-dies-at-87.html" title="">Bill Cunningham’s</a> photo spreads in The New York Times and name-dropped in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/arts/liz-smith-dead.html" title="">Liz Smith’s</a> syndicated gossip column.</p><p>They became active in the theater business and won two Tony Awards: one for best revival of a play, in 2003, for “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” and one for best play, the next year, for “I Am My Own Wife.”</p><p>Their situation changed in 2006, when Mr. Marshall’s sons sued him for elder abuse, claiming that he — and by extension Mrs. Marshall — had siphoned money away from his mother; tricked her into giving them the deed to her Maine summer home (which he then transferred to Mrs. Marshall); and slashed her expenses, including much of her domestic staff.</p><p>Mr. Marshall claimed that he was economizing for a woman who in her dotage no longer needed things like a large floral budget. His sons, and many of her friends, said he was motivated by greed.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mrs. Marshall with her husband in 2009.

Mr. Marshall left behind the manuscript for a memoir, “In the Shadow of a Monument,” which she published in 2023.</p><p>The book includes a closing chapter, written by Mrs. Marshall, in which she details the unclean conditions in which her husband was imprisoned. She blamed the system — the correctional system in particular, and Manhattan’s elite social network more broadly — for his death 15 months after his release.</p><p>“He’s gone now, but I’m so proud of him,” she wrote. “He always was and always will be a strong and dedicated Marine and the love of my life.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Clay Risen is a Times reporter on the Obituaries desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/clay-risen">More about Clay Risen</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/anthony-d-marshall">Anthony D.
