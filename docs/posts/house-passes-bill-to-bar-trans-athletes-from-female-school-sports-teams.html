It faces a steep challenge in the Senate, where seven Democrats would have to join Republicans to move it past a filibuster and to a final vote.</p><p>Just two Democrats joined all Republicans in voting in favor in the House, while another Democrat voted “present,” declining to register a position.</p><p>Republicans on Tuesday presented the legislation, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/us/politics/transgender-athlete-ban-bill.html" title="">they also pushed through during the last Congress</a>, as a popular and pragmatic way to level the playing field for female athletes, and as a move to protect women’s spaces and women’s rights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The overwhelming majority believe men don’t belong in women’s sports,” said Representative Greg Steube, the Florida Republican who sponsored the measure. “This bill will deliver upon the mandate the American people gave Congress.”</p><p>But Democrats, who dubbed the bill the “Child Predator Empowerment Act,” said it was a dangerous invasion of privacy for young girls that would put them at greater risk. They also pointed to the bill as the latest example of an unhealthy fixation among Republicans with trying to restrict the rights of transgender individuals, when they could be spending their time passing legislation to create jobs or reduce the prices of groceries.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
