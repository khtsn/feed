by a tussle between those advocating closer relations with the West and those who lean more toward Russia.</p><p>Now, as the country prepares for critical elections in October, the leader of the governing party has ignited a political firestorm by saying that Georgia should apologize for a 2008 war with Russia for which many Georgians blame Moscow.</p><p>On Saturday, Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of the governing Georgian Dream party, who built his fortune in banking, metals and real estate in Russia, said that the people of South Ossetia, which broke away from Georgia in the 1990s and expanded with Russian support in 2008, should receive an apology for the war that eventually broke out.</p><p>His <a

rally in Gori, a town that was briefly occupied by Russian forces in 2008, were quickly condemned by pro-Western activists and the opposition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Sunday, hundreds of people came to the Parliament building in Tbilisi, the capital, to protest against Mr. Ivanishvili’s statements, shouting, “No to the Kremlin’s diktat!”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SaakashviliMikheil/posts/pfbid02eJ7ZSJjPQsTwToTTtNj8YsC74RU1G6YvbR2SDjpkN7NH2nQ3MPcjMR9vNheMaMJzl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, Mikheil Saakashvili, who was Georgia’s president at the time of the 2008 war, called Mr. Ivanishvili’s statement “an unprecedented betrayal” and “an insult to the memory of the heroes who sacrificed for our country.”</p><p>“He asked Georgians to apologize for the invader,” said Mr. Saakashvili, who is serving a six-year sentence in Georgia on charges related to abuse of power that he says were politically motivated. “We won’t be able to wash away this shame for a while.”</p><p>The 2008 war with Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/world/europe/13georgia.html" title="">lasted five days</a>, but it left deep wounds in Georgia. It was initially fought over the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia, but quickly spread to other parts of the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Georgian soldiers run past a building hit by bombardment in Gori, Georgia, in 2008.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gleb Garanich/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Russia blocked the main east-west highway, and briefly occupied the strategic Black Sea port of Poti and other towns.

The elections are scheduled for Oct. 26.</p><p>At the end of 1991, Georgia was among the most pro-Western states to emerge from the ashes of the Soviet Union. But in recent years, the government of the Georgian Dream party, which has been in power since 2012, has grown increasingly critical of Western policies, and unwilling to criticize Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>In May, defying large-scale protests, the Georgian government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-law-passes.html" title="">passed a law</a> that aims to limit the influence of pro-Western nongovernmental groups and media outlets in the country.</p><p>The government is also now considering a package of bills that would ban “alternative” forms of marriage, the public promotion of same-sex relationships and gender-affirming surgery, among other measures.</p><p>Mariam Kiasashvili contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
