Lizzy, along with her four sisters — beautiful Jane, bookish Mary, impressionable Kitty, and Lydia, a shameless flirt — are all on the Georgian marriage market. But it is the fearless Lizzy who jokes, teases and outsmarts the lesser mortals in her orbit, including the snobbish Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mr. Collins, a witless clergyman. And it is Lizzy who, with the sheer force of her personality, eventually wins the proud, rich and handsome Mr. Darcy.</p><p>Yes, Austen certainly knew what she was doing when she created Lizzy, who in a letter to her sister Cassandra she said was “as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.”</p><p>What, then, would Austen have made of her modern readers’ more recent obsession with the middle Bennet sister, the plain and unremarkable Mary? Last month the BBC announced its plan for a 10-part drama, “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2024/bbc-announces-new-drama-the-other-bennet-sister" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Other Bennet Sister</a>,” which will be adapted from a novel by Janice Hadlow that explores the overlooked Mary’s predicament. “The Other Bennet Sister” is just the latest of a stream of re-imaginings in recent decades, including “The Independence of Miss Mary Bennet<em>,” </em>by Colleen McCullough and “The Unexpected Miss Bennet<em>,” </em>by Patrice Sarath. There seems to be something about Mary Bennet that the modern reader can’t leave alone.</p><p>Austen is masterly on family relationships and sibling rivalry, and her minor characters are always drawn with supreme skill, but she cast a wickedly critical eye on Mary. Mary is vain, but flails in her efforts at self improvement. She is judgmental of those around her whom we suspect she secretly envies. She desperately wants to say the smart thing, but can’t think of it in time. She repeats opinions she’s read as her own.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Could it be that we’re obsessed with her because she is all of us?</p><p>We first meet Mary in Chapter 2 of “Pride and Prejudice,” in a moment that’s indicative of the incessant teasing she endures from her family and, occasionally, her creator. “What say you, Mary?” asks her father, as the family discuss the wealthy Mr. Bingley, who has just moved to the area. “For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books, and make extracts,” Mr. Bennet continues, acidly. Austen then inserts a barb of her own: “Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.”</p><p>Without the good looks and charms of her sister siblings, Mary is thrown upon her limited intellectual endowments and third-rate musical accomplishments. Her happy place is a library where she reads in solitude, perhaps wanting to feel closer to her bookish father, whose casual cruelty undermines her confidence.</p><p>I’ve often wondered whether the naming of Mary was a sly dig at the most famous literary Mary of the age, Mary Wollstonecraft, whose “Vindication of the Rights of Woman,” published in the 1790s, might be described as the original feminist manifesto. For all the force of Wollstonecraft’s feminist beliefs, “Rights of Woman” is full of abstract principles and sententious moralizing. “In this work I have produced many arguments,” she writes, in a typical passage, “which to me were conclusive, to prove, that the prevailing notion respecting a sexual character was subversive of morality, and I have contended, that to render the human body and mind more perfect, chastity must more universally prevail, and that chastity will never be respected in the male world till the person of a woman is not, as it were, idolized when little virtue or sense embellish it with the grand traces of mental beauty, or the interesting simplicity of affection.” Quite.</p><p>We do not have conclusive evidence that Austen read “Rights of Woman,” but something in Mary Bennet’s earnestness and her sanctimonious, stultifying view of female agency and desire — her “threadbare morality,” as Austen called it, that she derives from the sermons she reads, suggests to me that Austen could have been at least familiar with Wollstonecraft’s opus. One can imagine her impatience. Austen’s feminism, by contrast, consisted not in telling but in showing<em> </em>that women can be rational beings.</p><p>For Austen, the most important freedom for a woman was the freedom to speak her mind and to be funny. Mary is never knowingly funny. When her youngest sister, Lydia, elopes with the unscrupulous Mr. Wickham, leaving the family reputation in tatters, Mary preaches a cold and unforgiving code: “Loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one false step involves her in endless ruin.” To this, Lizzy can only roll her eyes in utter bewilderment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But perhaps another way of seeing Mary is as a realist. She knows that if a woman is plain and poor, she has very little currency. She cannot pick and choose a husband, and is thus forced to be self-reliant. Her sisters have paired off — Lizzy and Jane, Lydia and Kitty — her father closets himself in his library and her mother is obsessed with matchmaking, so she is left to her own devices. Her clumsy efforts at self-improvement are, in their way, a courageous strike for independence.</p><p>The options for a young, not very marriageable woman such as Mary were so narrow in Austen’s time — a governess or schoolteacher. These days a family misfit can move away, find a job she loves and friends who understand her. Back then, only the rich or the extraordinary — like Austen — could be both unmarried and escape the confines of these limited roles.</p><p>If the BBC adaptation hews closely to Ms. Hadlow’s novel, Mary’s inner life will be revealed to be as rich and beautiful as her exterior is plain and awkward; a kind of prototype for Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” published a few decades after Austen’s novel. In “The Other Bennet Sister” Mary is lonely, overlooked and unfavorably compared with her handsome sisters. She is bullied by her ambitious mother who chiefly values beauty and who refuses to hire a governess to cultivate her mind. She takes succor in music and reading, and poignantly longs to be accepted by the extraordinary Lizzy.</p><p>Austen, I think, might have been quietly pleased with Mary getting her moment. There is a scene in “Pride and Prejudice<em>”</em> when Lydia talks giddily of a reckless carriage joyride with the blinds drawn up, to which Mary replies: “Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for <em>me</em>. I should infinitely prefer a book.”</p><p>One of the most beloved novelists in the English language must have had <em>some</em> sympathy for a girl who liked a good book.</p><p><a href="https://paulabyrne.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paula Byrne</a> is the author of “The Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things” and “The Genius of Jane Austen.”</p><p>Source photo: Focus Films, via Everett Collection.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
