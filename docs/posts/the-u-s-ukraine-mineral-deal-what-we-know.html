It could also clear the way for more consequential talks on U.S. military backing for Ukraine and on the terms of a possible cease-fire with Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-1"><div><h3>Here’s what we know:</h3><ul><li><a href="#link-16db295e">What happened in the Oval Office</a></li><li><a href="#link-6b403248">Sticking points</a></li><li><a href="#link-26850960">What’s in the deal?</a></li><li><a href="#link-585523e8">Ukraine’s mineral resources</a></li><li><a href="#link-16adbf1d">What Ukraine wants</a></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><h2 id="link-16db295e">What happened in the Oval Office</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump during his meeting in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The deal was initially meant to be signed when President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine visited Washington in February. But a signing ceremony was abruptly canceled after Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/zelensky-showdown-trump.html" title="">castigated the Ukrainian president</a> in the Oval Office for what they said was not being grateful enough for U.S. support and sought to press him into making a peace deal.</p><p>Since then, Mr. Zelensky repeatedly tried to smooth relations. And both he and Mr. Trump signaled that a deal could still be reached.</p><p>The major sticking point in the subsequent negotiations centered on whether the American aid given to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 would be treated as debt that Ukraine needed to repay.</p><h2 id="link-6b403248">Sticking points</h2><p>Early drafts of the deal had swiveled between what critics called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/trump-us-ukraine-mineral-deal.html" title="">a brazen extortion of Ukraine</a> by the Trump administration and versions that included points sought by Ukraine, such as references to U.S. support for postwar security guarantees. Without them, Ukraine says, Russia could quickly violate any cease-fire or restart the war after regrouping and rearming. Mr. Trump has said that Ukraine should look to Europe, not the United States, for such security guarantees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-26850960">What’s in the deal?</h2><p>The mineral deal will create a U.S.-controlled fund that would receive revenue from Ukraine’s natural resources, according to a copy of the agreement made public on Thursday.</p><p>In the end, it appears that Ukraine managed to get some of what it wanted, but not everything. In late March, the Trump administration said it wanted Ukraine to have to repay assistance given during the war with its mineral wealth — which would have financially hurt Ukraine for generations. The idea of treating that aid as debt was removed in the final deal. And the deal appears to specifically keep the door open for Ukraine to eventually join the European Union. </p><p>But the deal includes no security guarantee, something Ukraine had wanted to prevent Russia from regrouping after any cease-fire and attacking Ukraine again.</p><p>Ukraine’s parliament still has to ratify the agreement, which will probably happen in the next two weeks, lawmakers said Thursday morning. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-585523e8">Ukraine’s mineral resources</h2><p>Ukraine controls more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/ukraine-trump-minerals-explain.html" title="">100 major deposits of critical minerals</a>, according to a study by the Kyiv School of Economics, along with modest oil and natural gas reserves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-10"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="ukraine-minerals-xmtye" data-id="100000010010863" data-source-id="100000010010863"><div slug="ukraine-minerals-xmtye" data-sourceid="100000010010863" id="embed-id-100000010010863">
