Wells Fargo — which is owned by Comcast and which the Sixers share with the Flyers of the National Hockey League — is a short walk from the stadiums for the Eagles, of the National Football League, and the Phillies, of Major League Baseball.</p><p>Mayor Cherelle Parker described the news as “a win-win-win-win,” but the announcement was a stunning turnaround — a fact that she acknowledged. “This is a curveball that none of us saw coming.”</p><p>For months and even as recently as last week, the mayor had been an ardent champion of a new arena in Center City. It is a part of downtown that has been struggling, and the structure was seen as a big political win for the mayor in her first year in office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In outlining the new plan, she highlighted elements beyond the building of a new arena, including efforts to attract a W.N.B.A. team to the city and a commitment by the new Sixers-Comcast partnership to invest in the revitalization of Market Street East, the Center City neighborhood where the venue was supposed to be built.</p><p>“I don’t have the option of wallowing in a 180,” Mayor Parker said. “This is a celebration for the city.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Cherelle Parker of Philadelphia spoke about the proposed arena during a meeting with members of the community in September.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hannah Beier for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The decision came less than a month after a Dec. 19 vote by the City Council to approve a $1.3 billion plan to build the arena in Center City. That plan, which was discussed for years, had drawn persistent opposition, with protesters staging rallies, blocking traffic and crowding into the City Council chambers.</p><p>Much of the opposition was led by people who feared the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/us/philadelphia-chinatown-76ers-arena.html" title="">impact on the city’s historical Chinatown</a>, which is just outside the area where the arena was to have been built. But <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/sixers-arena-chinatown-poll-support/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public disapproval</a> of the plan was broad, driven by concerns about the ability of public transit to manage all the visitors and the history of stadiums that did not deliver on promises of big benefits to local economies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At a news conference in Chinatown, immediately after the one at City Hall, activists hailed the city’s about-face as a victory. But they said that their trust in the officials had eroded, because those people had prioritized the interests of the team’s billionaire owners over the voices of residents and businesses that stood to be displaced.</p><p>“How dare the politicians pretend to care about the community and vote yes?” said Wei Chen, the civic engagement director of <a href="https://www.aaunited.org" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asian Americans United</a>. “They should be ashamed of themselves,” he added, as the crowded started chanting “Shame! Shame!”</p><p>“Our community will remember those people who voted yes to destroy our community,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Campbell Robertson reports on Delaware, the District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/campbell-robertson">More about Campbell Robertson</a></span></p></div><div><p>David W.
