Local media reported that a top leader of the rebels, Nambala Keshav Rao, who goes by Basavaraju, was among those killed.</p><p>Last week, in another bloody confrontation, the government said it had killed 31 members of the movement in a hilly region between Chhattisgarh and a neighboring state.</p><p>Amit Shah, India’s home minister, called that operation a “historic breakthrough.” He has set a deadline of March for wiping out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/world/asia/india-maoist-guerrillas-naxalite.html" title="">the whole of the insurgency</a>, which has raged fitfully for more than 50 years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Human rights activists have warned of the possibility that innocent civilians have been killed in the campaign against the rebels. Bela Bhatia, a lawyer who works in regions affected by the insurgency, said that while rapid identification of the bodies by family members was crucial, the government often took days to present corpses.</p><p>She also said that when the Indian government claimed to have killed insurgents, it was unclear if “the killed Maoists surrendered and were then killed, or if they died in an encounter.”</p><p>India’s Maoist movement began as a guerrilla-style insurgency in the 1960s, when offshoots of Communist parties took up arms in the name of creating a classless society. It started in the eastern parts of the country and spread to the central and southern regions. The places where they are still active are collectively called the Red Corridor, a mostly forested area abundant in natural resources.</p><p>At its inception, the movement was a struggle for redistribution of land among landless farmers. Later, the cause became more associated with the rights of the 9 percent of Indians who belong to Indigenous minority groups. The fighters’ leaders have said they aim to protect tribal communities’ access to natural resources.</p><p>The Indian state regards the Maoists as an enormous threat, and critics say that this has led to military excesses in clamping down on the movement. In 2009, the prime minister at the time, Manmohan Singh, called them the country’s “biggest internal security challenge.” He made that assessment even after Islamist terrorists from Pakistan had been linked just a year before to a devastating attack in Mumbai.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During that period, India’s security forces were escalating a military campaign to defeat the Maoists. The conflict has claimed thousands of lives on both sides in the past five decades.</p><p>The current operations, which are happening under the shadow of a frightening military exchange this month with Pakistan, are proving to be deadly even by historical standards. So far this year, more than 200 insurgents have been killed, according to government data. The government says 700 others have given up arms and surrendered.</p><p>Along with the sprint to crush the insurgency directly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has undertaken development initiatives, like building wider roads to the remote regions where the movement has thrived. The hope has been that greater outreach to local residents, most of them tribal minorities, might persuade them to oppose the insurgents.</p><p>“But the people are suspicious,” Ms. Bhatia said. Many<span>   </span>who live in those parts of the country depend on the forest for their livelihood. “They wonder if this development is only to aid in mining and exploiting natural resources,” Ms. Bhatia said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Pragati K.B. is a reporter for The Times based in New Delhi, covering news from across India.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
