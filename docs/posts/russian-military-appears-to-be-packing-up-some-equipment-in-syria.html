Not all the chants were religious, reflecting the country’s newfound sense of liberty; in Damascus and in Idlib, a city that has long been rebel territory, people sang, “Raise your head high, you are a free Syrian!”</p><p>The largely celebratory mood in Damascus, the capital, belied the monumental challenges facing Syria’s new leaders as they try to bring order to a country wracked by sectarian divisions, the bloody legacy of the Assad era and the competing interests of an array of armed groups that fought in a 13-year civil war that human rights groups estimate killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war-death-toll.html" title="">hundreds of thousands of people</a>.</p><p>Also on Friday, Travis Timmerman, an American citizen who was found outside Damascus earlier this week, was handed over to U.S. forces by Syrian opposition representatives. Mr. Timmerman, who said he had been imprisoned while Bashar al-Assad was in power, is now in Jordan, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.</p><p>Here are other developments:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Blinken in Turkey:</strong> Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken held talks with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Ankara on Friday as the Biden administration and other governments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-us-israel-turkey.html" title="">try to shape the future of post-al-Assad Syria</a>. Both officials said a key priority was ensuring that Islamic State militants weren’t able to regain influence in the country.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drug seizure:</strong> Rebel fighters in Syria said that they had found <a href="#captagon-stimulant-assad-syria" title="">vast stockpiles of an illegal amphetamine called captagon</a> in a Damascus warehouse. The drug was the cornerstone of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/world/middleeast/syria-drugs-captagon-assad.html" title="">narcotics-trafficking ring</a> worth billions of dollars a year that was run by relatives and associates of the deposed President Bashar al-Assad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Torture charge:</strong> A federal grand jury in Los Angeles <a href="#torture-charges-syria-prison-official" title="">charged a former Syrian government official</a> with torturing political dissidents at a prison in Damascus.

Verified videos also showed at least one convoy of Russian military vehicles on the move on Friday.</p><div><p>The activity highlights the uncertainty of Moscow’s foothold in Syria after rebel forces ousted the Assad regime.</p><p>At the air base, two An-124 heavy transport planes were seen in Maxar satellite imagery with their nose cones lifted, being prepared for loading. The imagery also showed a Russian-made Ka-52 attack helicopter being dismantled, likely as preparation for transport. Components of a Russian-made S-400 air defense unit had also been moved near the planes.</p><p>Two videos verified by The Times also showed at least one convoy of Russian military vehicles moving north, near Damascus and Homs, in the direction of Khmeimim Air Base. The line of vehicles, stretching more than a half mile, was largely made up of cargo trucks, armored personnel carriers, mobility vehicles and SUVs. It is unclear from the videos if they arrived at the base or whether a significant portion of Russians soldiers and equipment may be preparing to depart Syria.</p><p>The Russian Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Under the Assad government that previously ruled Syria, Russia has for years maintained a military presence throughout the country, including the Tartus naval base and Khmeimim air base. The bases enable Russia to project its military power throughout the Mediterranean and into the Gulf.</p><p>U.S. officials said it would be a mistake to believe Russia was ready to give up on its bases in Syria. Russia would like, if it can, to maintain a long-term presence in Syria, including both its airfield and naval base, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive and evolving situation.</p><p>American officials said that Russia was scaling down its presence but not, so far, abandoning its positions. The officials cautioned that the situation was fluid, and changing by the day.</p><p>Another Western official said that the drawdown the Russian military was doing in Syria was significant, since Russia is moving forces out of its bases.</p><p>Russia’s ties to Syria have roots in the Soviet Union’s support of Mr. al-Assad’s father, President Hafez al-Assad, in the 1970s.</p><p>Most recently, it intervened in Syria’s civil war with brutal bombing campaigns that helped Bashar al-Assad’s military defeat rebel groups that rose up against him. But after invading Ukraine in 2022, Russia’s focus shifted and Moscow diverted resources to priorities closer to home, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/world/middleeast/russia-syria-israel-ukraine.html" title="">officials</a> based in the Middle East.</p><p>Any Russian withdrawal from Syria would signal Moscow’s failure on both a practical and symbolic level, according to experts. “The Russian Army’s performance in Ukraine and the fall of Assad is an advertisement for the weakness of Russian military equipment and the weakness of Russian political support,” said Jon B. Alterman, the director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>On a practical level, a diminished Russian military presence could threaten its direct access to the Mediterranean via Tartus, a deepwater port on Syria’s western coast. Satellite imagery and ship tracking data <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/russia-syria-assad.html" title="">reviewed by The Times</a> showed that Russian naval forces had withdrawn from the port earlier this week and that several of the ships were instead loitering several miles offshore.</p><p>Julian Barnes contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="33" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad0"><div id="ad-0" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="32" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMWU3MjA3ZmYtZjZmZC01MGFiLTllODQtODcwYzdlN2U1YTlj"><div id="1e7207ff-f6fd-50ab-9e84-870c7e7e5a9c" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/13/world/syria-news#1e7207ff-f6fd-50ab-9e84-870c7e7e5a9c"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley"><img alt="Michael Crowley" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-13T19:46:46.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 13, 2024, 2:46 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley" itemprop="name">Michael Crowley</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>Travis Timmerman, an American citizen who had been imprisoned while Bashar al-Assad was in power and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-timmerman-american-man-found.html" title="">found outside Damascus earlier this week</a>, was handed over to U.S. forces by Syrian opposition forces on Friday.

And on Fridays, after the weekly Muslim prayer service, the square was a place for protests against the Assad regime, calls for international intervention in the civil war and demands for prisoners to be set free.</p><div><p>This was the first Friday that the square was filled with nothing but joy.</p><p>A song rang out from one end: “Raise your head high, you’re a free Syrian.” At the other, a man sang to his lungs’ limit — joined by many in the teeming crowd who knew the lyrics well. “He who kills his people is a traitor.”</p><p>Between them was a sea of Syrian flags — with a green band rather than a red one, representing what was once the Syrian opposition, now the rulers of much of the country.</p><p>On the wall of a small park in the center of the square hung a plaque from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham government: “Renovation of the Seven Seas Roundabout and the area around it — 2021.” It showed how the group has focused on bringing order and repairing infrastructure, and reminded residents who did it. The group has tried to prove itself not only on the battlefield, but in the halls of governance as well.</p><p>In cities that were until recently under the control of the Assad government, residents complained about how it didn’t do anything for its people, including repairing the destruction wrought by its warplanes.

Most countries banned it in the 1980s because it was found to be highly addictive, with dangerous side effects that include psychosis, severe anxiety and suicidal tendencies. The illicit version sold today, often referred to as “captagon” with a lowercase c, usually contains a mix of amphetamines, caffeine and various fillers that are easier and cheaper to obtain. Produced for pennies a pill in Syria, captagon can sell for anywhere from $3 to $20 a pop on the street.</p><h2 id="link-e86de42">Who uses it?</h2><p>It is not widely used in the most of the world but is ubiquitous in the Middle East, where it is known as ‘Abu Hilalain,’ or ‘father of the two crescents’ for the logo of two interlocking Cs stamped on each pill.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of the tablets have been smuggled into Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries over the past several years, hidden in hollowed-out fruit, canned vegetables, flour shipments, water heaters, bakery ovens, cargo containers and other things.</p><p>Soldiers use it to boost endurance on the battlefield — leading to another nickname, “the drug of jihad.” But it is also a popular recreational drug, and is often used as a concentration aid for studying, according to a recently published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319016424002391#b0315" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> in a Saudi pharmaceutical journal.</p><h2 id="link-4517b83f">What is the captagon market worth?</h2><p>During the war, captagon became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/world/middleeast/syria-drugs-captagon-assad.html" title="">Syria’s most valuable export</a>, far surpassing its legal products, according to a database compiled by The Times of global busts.</p><p>Estimates vary widely about the size of the overall market.

Blinken made an unscheduled stop in Iraq on Friday as he toured the Middle East in an effort to promote stability in Syria after the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>After an overnight stop in Ankara, Turkey, Mr. Blinken flew in a military transport plane to Baghdad for a meeting with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani of Iraq.</p><div><p>American officials have expressed concerned that the fall of Mr. al-Assad’s authoritarian regime could produce new instability across Syria that might threaten its neighbors. The outbreak of civil war in Syria in 2011 helped to fuel the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group, which conquered large swaths of Syria and Iraq.</p><p>A U.S.-led coalition shattered that group, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-government-assad.html" title="">remnants of ISIS still operate in eastern Syria</a>.</p><p>The State Department said in a statement that, while in Baghdad, Mr. Blinken would highlight efforts to ensure an “inclusive transition” in Syria, with various religious, ethnic and political groups involved, as well as other regional security challenges.</p><p>He also intended to discuss the American commitment to the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership and to Iraq’s security, stability and sovereignty, the department said. But it is unclear what will become of such commitments under President-elect Donald J. Trump, who is set to take office in little more than a month and has more isolationist views.</p><p>In remarks to reporters after his meeting with Mr. al-Sudani, Mr. Blinken said that Washington was trying to encourage Syria’s new government to respect human rights and protect minorities.</p><p>He added that it was also crucial that ISIS not gain fresh strength, which could again threaten both Syria and Iraq.</p><p>“We are determined to make sure that Daesh cannot re-emerge,” Mr. Blinken said, using an alternative name for ISIS. “The United States and Iraq together had tremendous success in taking away the territorial caliphate that Daesh had created years ago, and now, having put Daesh back in its box, we can’t let it out,” he added.</p><p>After a visit to Jordan, Mr. Blinken met in Ankara on Thursday night with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Friday morning, he met with the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, who told reporters afterward that they had discussed how to ensure that both ISIS and the Kurdish militant group known as the P.K.K. are not “taking action, abusing the situation” in Syria.</p><p>The P.K.K. is a Kurdish nationalist group in Turkey, tied to Kurdish rebel forces within Syria, that the Turkish government considers an enemy. The U.S. has backed the Kurdish rebel forces, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, to help fight Islamic State. That has caused friction with Turkey, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-isis-united-states-kurds.html" title="">U.S. officials have sought to tamp down hostilities between Turkey and the S.D.F.</a> that they worry could distract from efforts to contain ISIS.</p><p>That was a subject to which Mr. Blinken alluded only indirectly, saying he and Mr. Fidan had “discussed the imperative of continuing the efforts to keep ISIS down.”</p><p>“Our countries worked very hard and gave a lot over many years to ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate of ISIS, to ensure that that threat doesn’t rear its head again,” he said. “And it’s imperative that we keep at those efforts.”</p><p>Jordan’s government announced that it would host a special meeting of foreign ministers from Arab countries and Turkey on Saturday, adding that Mr. Blinken would also attend.</p><p>Safak Timur<!-- --> contributed reporting from Istanbul.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNzk5MWVjZDAtYzg0YS01MGZjLTgyZjgtM2NlN2QyNWFkNGQz"><div id="7991ecd0-c84a-50fc-82f8-3ce7d25ad4d3" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/13/world/syria-news#7991ecd0-c84a-50fc-82f8-3ce7d25ad4d3"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman"><img alt="Aaron Boxerman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-13T14:26:05.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 13, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman" itemprop="name">Aaron Boxerman</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Jerusalem</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>As the world watches Syrians celebrate their liberation, the war in Gaza continues next door.

It is unclear whether Russia will be able to retain the military bases it has on Syria’s Mediterranean coast.</p><p>Initially, Turkey did not say much when the rebels swept across northern Syria, seizing two important cities in a few days. But when Mr. Erdogan finally did speak, he was quietly confident.</p><p>“The target is of course Damascus,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-hopes-syrian-rebels-will-advance-raises-alarm-about-some-2024-12-06/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said last Friday.</a> “Our hope is for this march in Syria to proceed without incidents.”</p><p>Two days later, the rebels delivered a personal vindication for Mr. Erdogan by storming into Damascus and taking control. Within a few days, Turkey was making plans to reopen its embassy, which has been closed for almost 13 years, and a senior Turkish official, Ibrahim Kalin, the head of the national intelligence agency, was seen in the Syrian capital in footage showed on Turkish television.</p><p>On Thursday, Turkey assigned a temporary chargé d’affaires to Damascus, a Turkish official said, asking for anonymity under diplomatic protocol. Appointing a chargé d’affaires rather than an ambassador is a way for Turkey to keep diplomatic channels open without getting into the debate of whether it is recognizing the largest rebel force, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, which led the offensive and has already set up a transitional government in Damascus. Turkey has considered the group a terrorist organization since 2018.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Bashar al-Assad in Istanbul in 2010.

Mr. Erdogan and his wife even hosted the Syrian first couple for a vacation on the Turkish coast. Relations blossomed, and so did economic benefits for both countries.</p><p>The relationship turned sour with the Arab Spring protests of 2011. Mr. al-Assad chose to impose harsh repression against Mr. Erdogan’s advice, a former Turkish presidential aide said. Affronted, the Turkish leader helped arm part of the opposition over the course of Syria’s civil war, and excoriated his Syrian counterpart in speeches.</p><p>He took in more than three million Syrian refugees and committed Turkish troops to secure a buffer zone inside Syria for millions more displaced people who took refuge there. And he funded and trained a Turkish-backed rebel force, the Syrian National Army, which provided security for Turkish military bases in northern Syria and helped Ankara fight Kurdish forces that Turkey viewed as a threat.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrians in Gaziantep, Turkey, waving opposition flags on Sunday while celebrating Mr. al-Assad’s fall.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Turkey also became the main interlocutor with H.T.S.

It also channeled humanitarian aid and trade into the region, which helped H.T.S. gain legitimacy among the people of the region. “All this has given Turkey influence over H.T.S.,” she wrote.</p><p>A Syrian rebel commander, interviewed on Friday, said the rebels had set up a joint command to coordinate rebel group operations.

In a statement, Turkey’s foreign ministry voiced strong support for Syria’s sovereignty, political unity and territorial integrity, and condemned Israel for breaking a longstanding disengagement agreement by “entering the Israel-Syria zone and its continuing advance into Syrian territory.”</p><p>(Since Mr. al-Assad’s ouster on Sunday, Israe<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">l has conducted hundreds of aerial strikes</a> on military targets in Syria.)</p><p>Turkey has been conducting its own military operations, including airstrikes, in northern Syria against Kurdish militants whom it considers a terrorist threat to Turkey. </p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces inspecting a destroyed truck after a Turkish airstrike near Qamishli, northeast of Syria, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmed Mardnli/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>One of Turkey’s most powerful politicians has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/middleeast/turkey-terrorist-attack-kurdish-peace-talks.html" title="">floated an offer</a> to release the long-imprisoned Kurdish militant leader, Abdallah Ocalan, if he agrees to renounce militancy and disband his armed movement, a gesture that suggested a new openness in the Turkish government to the possibility of revived peace talks between the longtime adversaries.</p><p>Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, has urged swift international assistance for Syria. “Syria has reached a stage where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country,” he said after a meeting in Doha, Qatar, among Turkey, Russia and Iran, Mr. al-Assad’s other main backer. “Today, there is hope. The Syrian people cannot achieve this alone.

The defeat of Mr. al-Assad, wrote the cleric Mohammad Shariati Dehghan, exposed Iranian’s strategy as misguided and “built on weak foundations.”</p><p>Mr. Shariati Dehghan demanded a new approach that prioritized building alliances with countries instead of propping up militant groups, and redirecting money and resources back to the people of Iran.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria, was stormed and vandalized this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The brash public debate is nothing short of extraordinary, given that for years Iranian leaders portrayed their support for Syria and allied militant groups fighting Israel as a nonnegotiable principle of the Islamic revolution and critical for national security.</p><p>“The Syria debate is happening at all levels of society, not just in the media and social media, but in daily interactions everywhere,” one prominent analyst, Hassan Shemshadi, said in a telephone interview from Tehran. “People are asking: Why did we spend so much money there? What did we achieve? What is our justification now that it’s all gone?”</p><p>Mr. Shemshadi, who is close to the government and until last year served as the head of the Iran-Syria Joint Chamber of Commerce, said that while the shape of future Iranian and Syrian relations was now uncertain, a strategic partnership built over four decades was now clearly history.</p><p>Gone, too, he said, is the unfettered access to supply routes in Syria that Iran had long had to equip militants across the region with weapons and other material.</p><p>The reaction from official Iran has been muddled.</p><p>President Masoud Pezeshkian and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi have sought to distance the nation from the events next door.</p><p>The Syrian people, the president and foreign minister said, have the right to determine their political future. The Iranian vice president for strategy, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said his country “stands ready to have good relations with the future government of Syria, and we have always stood at the side of Syrian people.”</p><p>But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, in his first public address about events in Syria, took a harsher tone on Wednesday. He blamed the United States and Israel for Mr. al-Assad’s downfall, referring to the rebels who toppled him as “aggressors” with competing motives who were serving their masters. He also alluded to Turkey’s support for some of the rebels in Syria.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, blamed the United States and Israel for Mr. al-Assad’s ouster.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“By God’s blessing, the territories occupied in Syria will be freed by the brave young people of Syria,” Mr. Khamenei said. “Have no doubt that this will happen.” He predicted that the “resistance” would spread widely across the region, and Iran would grow stronger.</p><p>“God willing,” chanted the audience of several hundred men and women sitting on the floor in the visitor’s hall of his compound.</p><p>But Mr. Khamenei’s speech flew in the face of the reality on the ground in Syria, where the army quickly folded as the rebels advanced and Syrians — young and old, men and women — celebrated the downfall of a tyrannical ruler by dancing in the streets chanting, “Freedom.”</p><p>Even Hamas, the Gazan militants for whom Iran and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon went out on a limb, issued a statement congratulating the Syrian rebels on their victory and declared it was standing with the Syrian people. Hamas had a brief falling out with Iran over a decade ago, when the Syrian uprising started, because each supported different sides.</p><p>Mr. Khamenei appeared outraged at the open criticism.<span>  </span>The comments, he said, were “a crime” because they were sowing fear among the public. Within hours, Iran’s judiciary announced a criminal investigation into a list of prominent figures and news outlets that have been leading the criticism. The list included Mr. Falahatpisheh, the former lawmaker, who revealed that Syrian debt to Iran amounted to about $30 billion.</p><p>For over 40 years, Syria served, in effect, as Iran’s central command base in the region. Its access to territory, shipping ports and airports was so unimpeded that a senior military commander once described Syria as a province of Iran.</p><p>Iran controlled military bases, missile factories, tunnels and warehouses that served the supply chain for its network of militants. From Syria, Iran funneled weapons, cash and logistical support to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and militants in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Iraq.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A banner in Tehran with a photo of the slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“Syria was a linchpin to Iran’s regional plan, the encircling of Israel in a ring of fire,” said Matthew Levitt, director of the counterterrorism program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research organization. “The axis of resistance was a three-legged stool of Iran, Syria and Hezbollah, and it no longer stands. ”</p><p>Mr. Levitt said Iran also counted on Syria economically. Its purchases of Iranian crude and refined oil, despite U.S. sanctions on Iran, helped Tehran pay for its military operations in the region.</p><p>Five Iranian officials said that after Syria fell, many colleagues, reeling, privately disclosed that Iran had lost everything in just 11 days. The officials said the government was still “disorientated,” “befuddled” and trying to find a way forward with Syria.</p><p>The officials, including members of the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps who have spent time in Syria, insisted on anonymity because they were discussing sensitive matters. They said that Iranian leaders were now resigned to accepting any level of diplomatic presence, however small, that Syria’s new leaders allowed. Two of the officials said Iran was keen to avoid the embarrassment of being completely ousted from Syria, with diplomatic ties cut and its embassy there shuttered.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Iranians breaking their Ramadan fast in April in Tehran near a giant poster of a general who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Araghchi, the foreign minister, said in an interview with state television on Sunday that Iran would base its next steps on the actions of Syria’s transitional leaders. He confirmed that Iran and the rebels had already exchanged messages, with the Syrians agreeing to requests that they protect Shia religious shrines and Iranian diplomatic outposts.</p><p>“Iran wants to move toward a direction that would eventually normalize its relations with Syria, but it’s going to be very difficult,” Rahman Ghahremanpour, a political analyst based in Tehran, said in a telephone interview. “The first priority right now is to make sure Syria does not turn into a base against Iran and a launchpad to attack its interests in Iraq or Lebanon.”</p><p>Mr. Ghahremanpour said the public reckoning that had erupted over Iran’s conduct in Syria could not be contained, and any official sugarcoating would not soften the severe blow. Some families of fighters killed when Iran deployed forces to Syria to help keep Mr. al-Assad in power are now asking if their loved ones had died in vain.</p><p>Alireza Mokarami, an Iranian veteran who fought in Syria’s civil war and now runs a local news site, posted a scathing takedown of Iran’s “catastrophic failure” in Syria in a widely circulated essay.</p><p>“Why were you spending billions of dollars of oil revenues that belong to the Iranian people on Assad until the very end if he wasn’t even listening to you?” he asked. He added, “At least on the topic of Syria, stop lying and be honest with the people.”</p><p>For the moment, the prospects of replicating the ties Iran once had with the Syria appear dim.</p><p>After the Assad regime was overturned, Syrians stormed the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, tearing down pictures of Iranian leaders and bringing down its flag. And Ahmed al-Shara, the Islamist rebel leader who spearheaded the insurgency, chastised Iran publicly.</p><p>The Assad regime, he said, brought many ills to his country — among them turning Syria into “a farm for Iranian greed.”</p><p>Leily Nikounazar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzVjMzhiOTMwLTljNGYtNTRiZS1iNzE4LTlhZTBhZDEzMmFjZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/13/world/syria-news#torture-charges-syria-prison-official" data-source-id="100000009875863"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-goldman"><img alt="Adam Goldman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-adam-goldman/author-adam-goldman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-adam-goldman/author-adam-goldman-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-adam-goldman/author-adam-goldman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-12-13T02:07:19.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Dec. 12, 2024, 9:07 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-goldman" itemprop="name">Adam Goldman</a></p><p>Reporting from Washington</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzVjMzhiOTMwLTljNGYtNTRiZS1iNzE4LTlhZTBhZDEzMmFjZA=="><a href="#torture-charges-syria-prison-official">The U.S. charges a former Syrian prison official with torture.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adra prison on the outskirts of Damascus, Syria, in 2010.

He was arrested attempting to fly to Beirut.</p><p>The U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, Martin Estrada, cast the new charges against Mr. al-Sheikh in a grim light. “The allegations in this superseding indictment of grave human rights abuses are chilling,” he said.</p><p>Mr. al-Sheikh was charged with three counts of torture and one count of conspiracy to commit torture.</p><p>Mr. al-Sheikh immigrated to the United States in 2020 and applied for U.S. citizenship in 2023, lying on federal forms about the abuses, the authorities have said.</p><p>Prosecutors said he was appointed governor of the province of Deir al Zour by Mr. al-Assad in 2011.
