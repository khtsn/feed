I still can’t hear.”</p><p>Her injury was inflicted 44 years ago, when this ginkgo-tree-lined midsize city in the southwest of South Korea erupted in a student-led uprising for democracy, a day after the military ruler declared nationwide martial law. Paratroopers stormed the city, Gwangju, and brutally beat, stabbed and indiscriminately fired upon throngs of citizens young and old. Hundreds were left dead or missing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>This week, when President Yoon Suk Yeol stood in front of the South Korean people and declared martial law for the first time since then, the outrage was deepest in Gwangju, where memories are still raw of resistance paid for in blood.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Families and relatives gathering around the coffins of dead protesters at provincial headquarters in Gwangju, in May 1980.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kim Chon Kil/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the intervening decades, in a country whose modern history has been defined by rapid change and swift adaptation, Gwangju has sought to remember and be remembered for the bloodshed that marked a foundational moment in South Korea’s path to democracy.</p><p>Those efforts are apparent in the city today. On the pockmarked exterior wall of a former newspaper building in the city center, bullet holes are encircled in neon orange to make them visible from a distance. The bus line that winds through town on the way to the cemetery where victims of the uprising are buried is No. 518, for the date the protests began in 1980: May 18. Each May on the eve of the date, thousands of people take to the streets to march the route the first protesters took.</p><p>When this year’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/arts/nobel-prize-literature.html" title="">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> was awarded to the Gwangju-born author Han Kang, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/books/review/han-kang-human-acts.html" title="">sparse, stark novel “Human Acts”</a> was based on those fateful days, the people of Gwangju shed tears, yelped with disbelief, felt shivers down their spine with a sense of validation and recognition they have long sought. The Swedish Academy said it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/world/asia/han-kang-nobel-south-korea.html" title="">awarding the prize to Ms. Han</a> “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bullet marks from the 1980 pro-democracy uprising at Jeonil Building 245 in Gwangju, in December.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Youngrae Kim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It was our story that won the highest honor in the world. That brings solace,” said Kim Tae-yun, who was 20 when he was hit in the face with a bullet while trading fire with soldiers, and wears a false eye to this day.</p><p>One place where the city’s pain endures strongest is the May Mothers House, a two-story building near a stream in the city’s eastern edge. Originally a support and advocacy group for relatives of people incarcerated for their role during the protests, it was established as a physical center in 2006. It is now a gathering place for women in their waning years who lost their children or husbands during the uprising, or were themselves injured. Among them is Ms. Jang; the son she’d been looking for that day, Chul, was imprisoned and tortured for taking part in the protests.</p><p>Its director is Kim Hyung-mi, whose older brother was severely beaten and never fully recovered. He spent seven years in mental institutions before he ultimately died from the aftereffects. (Ms. Kim is married to Kim Tae-yun, whom she met through their activism.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kim Hyung-mi and her husband, Kim Tae-yun, at May Mothers House, a place founded by women who lost loved ones, faced imprisonment or were injured during the 1980 pro-democracy uprising in Gwangju.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Youngrae Kim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>She calls each of the now-elderly women who visit the home regularly — for meals together, and for yoga and art classes — “umma,” or “mother.” Her own mother continued to pine for her son years after his death: never discarding his books, seeing his face in the face of every man who was around the age he would have been had he lived. Only the dementia that ate away at her memories in the final three months of her life, Ms. Kim said, seemed to give her some relief.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Mothers only forget when they die,” she said.</p><p>During the 10-day uprising, Gwangju was utterly isolated. The military cut phone lines and closed all roads. Censors blocked or minimized reports of what was happening in the city, having seized control of the news media through martial law. In the immediate aftermath, the military junta in power depicted the unrest as a violent riot instigated by Communist sympathizers and agents from North Korea, deserving of the brutal crackdown. Numerous citizens were arrested, tortured and imprisoned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members doing yoga at May Mothers House.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Youngrae Kim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In the months and years that followed, the people of Gwangju fought to get their story known in the rest of South Korea and beyond. Through their efforts, the uprising has become widely acknowledged as a catalytic moment in South Korea’s path to democracy. The events have been retold and commemorated in books, television dramas, films, poetry, orchestral music, plays and even a couple of operas.</p><p>“Human Acts,” which depicts the uprising and its aftermath from the perspectives of six ordinary people who experienced it, is possibly one of the most intimate and visceral retellings.</p><p>In the original Korean text, the city that forms the backdrop is hardly mentioned by name, as if to invoke it would be too painful. “That city,” a couple of the characters call it. At times, it is referred to as “gohyang”<em> </em>(hometown), and sometimes, simply “there.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Ms. Han, who was born in Gwangju in 1970, moved with her family to Seoul when she was 9 years old, just months before the uprising. Adults around her spoke of the atrocities in their home city in hushed voices. A few years later, she came across a book of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/world/asia/south-korea-photos-gwangju-crackdown.html" title="">photos of the violence</a> that her father had hidden away, one of the ways that information about what happened was secretly circulating in the country.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Na Kyung Taek in front of his photographs at an exhibit in June about the Gwangju uprising.
