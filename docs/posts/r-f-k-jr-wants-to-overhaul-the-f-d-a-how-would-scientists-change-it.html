    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“The current 510(k) pathway is a joke,” said Dr. Rita Redberg, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who previously served on a medical device advisory panel. “The things that get approved are just shocking.”</p><p>She gave the example of a device used to prevent blood clots, which uses a string to tie off a heart chamber. It was cleared in 2006 through the 510(k) pathway for being equivalent to a skin suture. “I don’t know how you could say something you put inside someone’s heart to tie off a chamber is equivalent to a skin suture and not require any studies,” Dr. Redberg said. “But that’s what happened.”</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://www.dicardiology.com/article/fda-announces-safety-issues-lariat-left-atrial-appendage-laa-closure-device" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.D.A. issued a safety alert</a> about the device after identifying several deaths and other serious complications, including hemorrhage, associated with its use.</p><p>In response to the experts’ criticisms, the F.D.A. official wrote that the agency expects “more evidence to support a marketing authorization decision” through the 510(k) program than in the past, including clinical data in some cases.</p><h3 id="link-77742423"><span><strong>Food Additives</strong></span></h3><p>Another loophole several experts took issue with is the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) designation.</p><p>The label, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/gras-substances-scogs-database/history-gras-list-and-scogs-reviews" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced in 1958</a>, was intended to streamline the approval of new products that contained everyday ingredients already in the food supply, like vinegar and salt. But over time, it has become the go-to route for manufacturers to introduce virtually any new ingredient to the market. That includes <a href="https://www.hfpappexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/index.cfm?set=SCOGS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of polysyllabic chemicals found in food additives</a>, such as propylparaben and butylated hydroxyanisole.</p><hr/><blockquote><h2>“The F.D.A. is responsible for ensuring that dangerous and adulterated and mislabeled supplements are removed from the marketplace. What they have done in that area is remarkably little compared to the problem.”</h2><p>Dr. Pieter Cohen, associate professor at Harvard Medical School</p></blockquote><hr/><p>What’s more, companies are allowed to designate an ingredient as GRAS themselves and put their product onto the market without having to prove that it is safe or even inform the F.D.A.</p><p>“Either GRAS needs to be completely reformed, or we need to have an entirely new system,” said Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington who studies endocrine-disrupting chemicals.</p><p>Dr. Sathyanarayana also called for more efficient processes to review ingredients already on the market and remove them if they’re found to be unsafe.</p><p>The F.D.A. official wrote that “the food industry is responsible for ensuring the safety of ingredients,” but added that strengthening oversight of food chemical safety is an agency priority.</p><h3 id="link-6510dd9"><span>Supplements</span></h3><p>Under the current laws, the F.D.A. does not approve dietary supplement ingredients or their labels. “Many dietary supplements can be legally brought to market without the F.D.A. even knowing,” the F.D.A. official acknowledged.</p><p>That lack of regulation has resulted in potentially dangerous products ending up on shelves, said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements. Recently, there have been reports of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916524008852" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prenatal vitamins</a> being contaminated with heavy metals, and of supplements like melatonin containing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/well/melatonin-childrens-supplements.html" title="">drastically different amounts</a> than what’s listed on the bottle.</p><p>In these types of cases, the F.D.A. often sends warning letters to companies, but it rarely issues mandatory recalls. Dr. Cohen would like to see the agency use recalls more often, and much sooner. “The F.D.A. is responsible for ensuring that dangerous and adulterated and mislabeled supplements are removed from the marketplace,” Dr. Cohen said. “What they have done in that area is remarkably little compared to the problem.”</p><h2 id="link-714c17e2">4. Break the F.D.A. into two agencies.</h2><p>Some food safety experts called for a drastic change: separating the F.D.A. into two agencies, one focused on food and the other on drugs.</p><p>“The regulation of drugs is very different than the regulation of food, and if you try and apply the same model that you use for drugs to food, you can run into problems,” said Barbara Kowalcyk, the director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University and a member of the F.D.A.’s Science Board.</p><p>An independent food agency could provide a larger budget for more frequent and rigorous inspections of manufacturing plants and produce farms, Dr. Kowalcyk said. With additional resources and greater authority, regulators could conceivably catch more problems before they reach the food supply and sicken people.</p><p>Better funding would also allow for more research into the connection between food and chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, said Jerold Mande, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and the chief executive of Nourish Science, a nonprofit focused on nutrition policy and research.</p><hr/><blockquote><h2>“The regulation of drugs is very different than the regulation of food, and if you try and apply the same model that you use for drugs to food, you can run into problems.”</h2><p>Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University</p></blockquote><hr/><p>“They’re just never going to get funded” to do this research with the current structure, said Mr. Mande, who worked at the F.D.A. in the 1990s.</p><p>At a recent congressional hearing on the connection between food and chronic diseases, the F.D.A.’s outgoing commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf, agreed that the agency should do more research on food, and would if it had the necessary funding. “If we had a bigger budget,” he said, “we would have studied a lot more things.”</p></div></div>
