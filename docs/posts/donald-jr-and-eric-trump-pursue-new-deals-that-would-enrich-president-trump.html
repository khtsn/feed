That is in part because the sons appeared before mostly fawning crowds but also because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status.html" title="">President Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/mike-waltz-signal-photo.html" title="">his appointees</a> and his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/elon-musk-spacex-trump-budget.html" title="">billionaire adviser Elon Musk</a> were making headlines with their own steady stream of norm-breaking controversies.</p><p>“There’s nothing like it,” said Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University historian who has written books on Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford, addressing the financial conflicts of interest that have emerged in Mr. Trump’s second term.</p><p>Both Trump sons are involved in a wide range of family business ventures. Eric Trump, the president’s middle son, runs the Trump Organization, the main family business, which specializes in real estate. He also serves on the board of a holding company that oversees World Liberty Financial, the family’s crypto firm, and recently joined forces with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/business/trump-bitcoin-mining.html" title="">start a Bitcoin mining operation, American Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>The White House has said there are no ethics issues because Mr. Trump’s sons run the businesses. “The president’s assets are in a trust managed by his children,” Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said. “There are no conflicts of interest.”</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Candidate-Report-Donald-J.-Trump-2024-Part-6.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial disclosure report,</a> which he is legally required to file, shows that he still personally benefits financially from most of these ventures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Eric Trump noted that many of the ventures they are promoting — from crypto to real estate — were underway before their father was re-elected. “We are building the most iconic projects on earth and leading the way in the digital revolution,” Eric Trump said in a statement to The New York Times.</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. rejected any suggestion that he was trading on his father’s name, saying he has been a businessman his entire adult life. He then took a swipe at Hunter Biden, who sold paintings while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/hunter-biden-art-market.html" title="">his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., served as president</a>.</p><p>“It’s laughable that the left-wing media thinks that I should lock myself in a padded room while my father is president and cease doing what I’ve been doing for over 25 years to earn a living and provide for my five children,” Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement to The Times. “However, if I did do that, I guess I could always take up painting, which I hear can be quite lucrative.”</p><p>Indeed, relatives of other presidents — including Billy Carter (brother of President Jimmy Carter) and Neil Bush (brother of President George W. Bush), along with Hunter Biden — have had business dealings that have created questions about potential conflicts of interest.</p><p>What distinguishes the work of Mr. Trump’s two sons is that several of these ventures, including the real estate deals and crypto efforts, bring revenues that benefit the president himself as well.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Just in the past 10 days, Donald Trump Jr. made stops in Hungary, <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/europes-disgraced-politicians-and-moguls-line-up-to-meet-trump-jr-gfw6s59rc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Romania</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DI6vTarsFuD/?locale=undefined" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serbia</a> and Bulgaria on a paid-speech tour he has called “Trump Business Vision 2025,” which also included visits with <a href="https://www.bocskairadio.org/donald-trump-jr-szijjarto-peterrel-talalkozott-budapesten/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foreign government</a> leaders <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DI6vTarsFuD/?locale=undefined" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and</a> political <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/europes-disgraced-politicians-and-moguls-line-up-to-meet-trump-jr-gfw6s59rc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">candidates.</a> During roughly the same time, Eric Trump was shuttling among Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other Middle East spots to push the family’s real estate and crypto plans.</p><p>These pitches played out even as some of Donald Trump Jr.’s<span>  </span>business partners were simultaneously rolling out yet another business in Washington that will cash in on his father’s return to the White House: a club called Executive Branch.</p><p>At $500,000 a person, the private membership club is slated to open by this summer in Georgetown in a sprawling, but defunct, restaurant called <a href="https://b66harrison.viewin360.co/share/collection/7F5Mp?fs=1&amp;info=0&amp;logo=-1&amp;sd=1&amp;thumbs=-1&amp;vr=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clubhouse</a>.
