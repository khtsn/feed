At the same time, Mr. Trump has escalated a trade war with China, potentially squeezing European companies.</p><p>We are a team of reporters who write about business and economic issues in Europe for The New York Times. In recent weeks, we have covered how tariffs have been affecting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/trump-tariffs-uk-cars.html" title="">the car industry</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/business/us-dollar-euro-trade-trump.html" title="">financial markets</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/german-economy-trump-tariffs.html" title="">economic expectations for European countries</a>.</p><p>To better understand the impact the tariffs are having on companies in Europe, including Britain, we would like to hear from business owners, entrepreneurs, managers and employees. How might the import taxes affect your company or job? Have you delayed hiring, postponed expansion plans or canceled orders? Have you altered your supply chains? We would also like to hear what tariffs mean for your production, and whether you are considering moving some part of it to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>We will read every response and reach out if we are interested in learning more.
