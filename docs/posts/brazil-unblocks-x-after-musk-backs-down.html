The company also complied with other orders, including paying fines and naming a new representative in the country.</p><p>X’s compliance marked a stark reversal for Mr. Musk, who had loudly criticized and defied the court for months, going so far as to publish its sealed orders and to close X’s offices in Brazil. The court responded by blocking X across Brazil in August, sending millions of Brazilians to the platform’s competitors.</p><p>But now X is returning in Brazil and obeying orders that Mr. Musk had vowed to resist. X said in <a href="https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1839480546621100315" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent statement</a> that it “is committed to protecting free speech within the boundaries of the law and we recognize and respect the sovereignty of the countries in which we operate.” It added that the company would use “legal processes” to defend freedom of speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Justice Moraes on Tuesday gave regulators 24 hours to let X come back online in Brazil, though it could take more time for the site to return.</p><p>The apparent resolution to the monthslong battle represented a defeat for Mr. Musk, who has styled himself as an outspoken defender of free speech. His company lost a month of business in one of its biggest markets, allowing rivals to gain a foothold there, only to end up exactly where it began.</p><p>Yet, despite the legal and business loss, Mr. Musk and his backers may view the ordeal as a public-relations victory. Standing up to Brazil’s Supreme Court — which has acted aggressively to censor certain voices on social media — attracted the billionaire entrepreneur widespread praise from people worried about governments restricting what can be said online. That was despite his compliance with government orders elsewhere to remove accounts and posts.</p><p>On the other hand, the outcome is a victory for Brazil’s Supreme Court and, specifically, Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the judge who led the fight against X. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Justice Moraes has become a polarizing figure in Brazil for his sweeping push to police the internet, and his move to block X was his most hotly debated decision yet. But many in Brazil, particularly on the left, praised the judge’s stance as an example of a developing country standing up to the world’s richest man and his powerful tech empire.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Justice Alexandre de Moraes led the charge to block X in Brazil.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriano Machado/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The turn of events in Brazil also suggests that nation-states still hold the upper hand in the ongoing power struggle with big tech companies.</p><p>The fight has centered on Justice Moraes’ demands to remove accounts on X that he said spread hate speech or were a threat to Brazil’s democracy. In most cases, he has not disclosed what the accounts had done to warrant suspension. But in some of his orders released by X, he showed the accounts had questioned Brazil’s elections and sympathized with protesters demanding a military coup.</p><p>Mr. Musk has said that suspending the accounts is a dangerous example of governments controlling speech. He has railed against Justice Moraes for months, calling him a dictator and saying he should be imprisoned. </p><p>“This was an arm-wrestling match between the Supreme Court and Elon Musk,” said Laura Porto, a Brazilian lawyer and a specialist in digital law. “And I see it as a victory for national sovereignty, for Brazil as a whole, having managed to impose these limits.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Musk had tried to use various workarounds to fight the blocking of X. Starlink, a satellite-internet service he controls, told regulators that it would defy orders to block X in Brazil. Then X used a technical maneuver to briefly evade the block and have its site function again for many Brazilians.</p><p>But Starlink quickly complied when regulators threatened to revoke its license in the country. X’s technical workaround was blocked within a day. And Justice Moraes even forced X to pay fines it was avoiding in Brazil by taking money from Starlink.</p><p>As a result, X suffered defeat after defeat, and the company eventually relented.</p><p>To many conservatives in Brazil, however, the dispute showed how Brazil’s Supreme Court has grown too powerful. “We’re not going to stop until we return democracy to Brazil!” Eduardo Girão, a right-wing Brazilian senator, <a href="https://x.com/EduGiraoOficial/status/1840421630486454777" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X alongside a video of him at a protest calling for Justice Moraes’s impeachment.</p><p>And some are holding out hope that Mr. Musk’s reversal is just a temporary peace deal and that the businessman has other plans to subvert the court soon. Another right-wing Brazilian congressman recently suggested <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VwFL-Kq8Dw&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poder360.com.br%2F&amp;source_ve_path=OTY3MTQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview</a> that Mr. Musk was only “temporarily” complying with the court’s orders, so that the ban on X would be lifted, but that Mr. Musk still planned to lobby for Justice Moraes’s impeachment.</p><p>Brazil is one of X’s most important international markets, with analysts estimating that it had more than 20 million users there. But, since the ban, Brazilians have flocked to other platforms, and it’s unclear if they will rush back to X.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Musk, who had tried to use various workarounds to fight the block of X, capitulated to the demands of Brazil’s Supreme Court.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Bluesky, a social network similar to X, attracted a wave of new users in recent weeks. From Aug. 31 — when X went dark in Brazil — to Sept. 29, Bluesky’s average daily users on its app in Brazil doubled to 6.8 million, according to Similarweb, a data intelligence firm.</p><p>Daily users on Threads, the X competitor from Meta, grew by a third to 3.6 million in Brazil over that period. The number of Brazilians on X, by comparison, plummeted by 80 percent since its ban, to 1.2 million, with Similarweb explaining that most of the traffic was driven by users unsuccessfully trying to access the platform. </p><p>But some Brazilians were able to sidestep the ban by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, common privacy software that disguises the location of internet traffic. </p><p>Most of those people sided with Mr. Musk. About 90 percent of the politically related posts from users who kept logging on criticized the ban and Justice Moraes, according to a study by the Getúlio Vargas Institute, a Brazilian research institution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Justice Moraes had threatened to fine users $9,000 per day if they used VPN software to access the platform, and Brazil’s federal police said last month that it had received court orders to identify those who defied the ban.</p><p>Despite X’s vast user base in Brazil, the ban on Mr. Musk’s social media platform is not likely to have had a significant impact on its bottom line. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-04/how-much-money-is-elon-musk-s-x-losing-by-being-blocked-in-brazil?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=zVYYYI5e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported last month</a> that Brazil accounted for just 2 percent of its overall earnings.</p><p>Globally, X is still far larger than its rivals, with 84 million daily users on its app, according to Similarweb. Threads has about 41 million daily users, while Bluesky has 7.5 million, nearly all now in Brazil.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief for The Times, based in Rio de Janeiro, where he leads coverage of much of South America.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The World of Elon Musk</h2><h3>The billionaire’s portfolio includes the world’s most valuable automaker, an innovative rocket company and plenty of drama.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>5 Days With Musk on X: </strong>Almost a third of 171 posts from the X owner over a five day period were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/elon-musk-x-posts.html">false, misleading or missing vital context</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk Hails Italy’s Leader: </strong>Elon Musk and Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, were the stars of a black-tie dinner in New York that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/business/elon-musk-giorgia-meloni.html">highlighted Musk’s increasing involvement in politics</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brazil’s X Ban: </strong>Lawyers for Musk’s social network, X, said the company had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/world/americas/elon-musk-x-brazil.html">complied with court orders in Brazil</a> to censor certain accounts, a surprise reversal seeking to overturn its block there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk’s Security Apparatus: </strong>As threats to Musk’s personal safety have become graver, he has barricaded himself behind a phalanx of bodyguards that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/technology/elon-musk-security.html">operates like a mini Secret Service</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tesla’s Superchargers: </strong>Musk’s plan to open Tesla’s well-regarded charging network to electric vehicles from other carmakers is proceeding slowly. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/business/energy-environment/tesla-electric-vehicle-charging.html">Nobody is entirely sure why</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
