Young women, young men born free in the highlands of Angola, only to be captured, bound and forced in a death march along this very coast. I’ve learned that while history can be hidden, it cannot and should not be erased. It should be faced. It’s our duty to face our history, the good, the bad and the ugly. The whole truth. That’s what great nations do. Most countries are founded based on race, ethnicity, religion, geography, some other attribute. But the United States founded an idea, one embedded in our Declaration of Independence, that all men and women are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. It’s abundantly clear today we have not lived up to that ideal. But we’ve never fully walked away from it either. And that’s due in no small part to the determination and dreams of African Americans. Today, I’m announcing over $1 billion in new humanitarian support for Africans displaced from homes by historic droughts and food insecurity.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03biden-africa1-lkzm/03biden-africa1-lkzm-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">President Biden became the first U.S. president to travel to Angola and delivered remarks at the National Museum of Slavery in Luanda.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs"><img alt="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" title="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker"><img alt="Peter Baker" title="Peter Baker" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs" itemprop="name">Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker" itemprop="name">Peter Baker</a></p><p>The reporters traveled with President Biden in Luanda, Angola.</p></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-12-03T15:31:45-05:00"><span>Dec. 3, 2024</span><span>Updated <span>3:31 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>When American presidents visit another country, they typically like to highlight the positive history they share. But as the first leader of the United States to visit Angola, President Biden opted instead to focus on the most bitter chapter that connects the United States and this giant southern African nation.</p><p>At the National Museum of Slavery in the capital, Luanda, Mr. Biden recalled in a speech on Tuesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/africa/angola-biden-slavery.html" title="">the slave trade that once defined relations between America and Angola</a>. More Africans sold into slavery in the United States came from this part of the continent than anywhere else, scholars say, a legacy of inhumanity that remains relevant four centuries later.</p><p>The president’s decision to emphasize that connection served not only as a nod to the wounds inflicted on generations of Africans, but also as a statement of principle in the contemporary debate underway in his own country about how to teach and remember history. At a time when some Republicans have sought to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/us/texas-history-1836-project.html" title="">limit instruction about slavery</a> and other shameful chapters of American history, Mr. Biden argued for confronting the past.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I have learned that while history can be hidden, it cannot and should not be erased,” the president told an audience at the museum, where he was joined by several Black Americans whose descendants were enslaved in Angola and trafficked across the Atlantic Ocean. “It should be faced. It’s our duty to face our history — the good, the bad and the ugly, the whole truth. That’s what great nations do.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03biden-africa2-mlqh/03biden-africa2-mlqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03biden-africa2-mlqh/03biden-africa2-mlqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03biden-africa2-mlqh/03biden-africa2-mlqh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="President Biden stands outside a concrete white building that is flanked by trees and the Angolan flag, which is red and black and has a yellow emblem resembling a hammer and sickle." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03biden-africa2-mlqh/03biden-africa2-mlqh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03biden-africa2-mlqh/03biden-africa2-mlqh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03biden-africa2-mlqh/03biden-africa2-mlqh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/03/multimedia/03biden-africa2-mlqh/03biden-africa2-mlqh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/4909d164-8650-5577-8184-982da6b95bad" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Biden spoke about the legacy of the slave trade and the future of relations between America and Africa.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He called slavery “cruel, brutal, dehumanizing, our nation’s original sin, original sin, one that haunted America and cast a long shadow ever since.” And while the United States has never fully “lived up to that idea” of a truly equal society, he said, “we’ve never fully walked away from it, either.”</p><p>Among those on hand for Mr. Biden’s visit was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2019/08/21/wanda-tucker-angola-slavery-1619-history-america-black-family/2016591001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wanda Tucker</a>, a descendant of William Tucker, believed to be the first enslaved child born in the United States. His parents were brought from Angola to colonial Virginia in 1619 aboard the White Lion, a Portuguese ship. The William Tucker 1624 Society was organized to research and share the stories of the first enslaved people brought to Virginia.</p><p>Long before coming to Angola for the first and only trip to sub-Saharan Africa of his presidency, Mr. Biden had taken steps to reckon with the history of racism and slavery in America.</p><p>Shortly after he came into office, he made Juneteenth a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States. His vice president, Kamala Harris, in 2023 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/world/africa/kamala-harris-ghana-slavery.html" title="">visited the Cape Coast Castle in Ghana</a>, a site used for the slave trade in the 17th century.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Biden also has at times expressed concern over the attempts in the United States to restrict how the less-flattering parts of American history are taught. He screened the movie “Till,” about the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a Black teenager, in the same White House theater where, in 1915, President Woodrow Wilson premiered “The Birth of a Nation,” a film celebrating the Ku Klux Klan.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Biden and President João Lourenço of Angola at the Presidential Palance in Luanda on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Biden later established a national monument honoring the slain teenager and his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, just as Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida came under fire after education officials in his state decreed that middle schoolers should be taught that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/us/african-american-history-standards-florida-task-force.html" title="">enslaved people benefited by developing skills from slavery</a>.</p><p>In May, Mr. Biden spoke to a crowd at the National Museum of African American History and Culture to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark civil rights ruling that outlawed racially segregated schools. As a senator, Mr. Biden cosponsored legislation to establish the museum.</p><p>But in his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Biden also pivoted forward to stress how far the United States and Africa had come since those days of misery. He pointed to U.S. investments and other commitments to the continent, where Angola is an important source of oil and mineral resources.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Like other presidents, Mr. Biden said he had worked to transform the basis of the modern-day relationship from one of aid to one of trade.</p><p>“The United States is expanding our relationship all across Africa from assistance to aid, investment to trade, moving from patrons to partners to help bridge the infrastructure gap,” he said. “The right question in the year 2024 is not what can the United States do for the people of Africa. It’s what can we do together for the people of Africa.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
