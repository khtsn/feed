Trump has appointed two of his friends and financial backers to oversee a transition team preparing for his potential return to power.</p><p>The move comes as polls show that his once-commanding lead evaporated after President Biden dropped out and Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee.</p><p>The two co-chairs of a Trump transition, Linda E. McMahon and Howard Lutnick, will oversee efforts to identify and vet potential political appointees and draft executive orders and other plans to implement Mr. Trump’s policy proposals on matters ranging from a sweeping crackdown on immigration to hiking tariffs on imported goods.</p><p>The selection of the two, which the Trump campaign announced on Friday, was notable for several reasons. As a matter of timing, it came months after presidential campaigns normally start working on contingency planning to ensure a smooth transition should their candidate win the election.</p></div></div><div><div><p>It was also striking that neither Ms. McMahon nor Mr. Lutnick has been associated with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/project-2025.html" title="">Project 2025</a>, an effort by a consortium of conservative think tanks to develop personnel and policy transition planning for the next Republican president. While Mr. Trump has close ties to leaders of that effort, he has recently tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/project-2025-director-steps-down.html" title="">distance himself from it</a> as Democrats have seized on some of its more radical proposals.</p><p>“I have absolute confidence the Trump-Vance administration will be ready to govern effectively on day one,” Mr. Trump said in a statement accompanying the announcement of his 2024 transition team.</p><p>A Trump team official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the transition, said the effort would not be established with money the federal government makes available for transitions, but instead through a tax-exempt group the campaign has established. The official would not answer questions as to why, but Mr. Trump has consistently expressed distrust of the Biden administration and its posture toward him. </p><p>Ms. McMahon, a major donor to Mr. Trump who is married to the professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon, served in his first administration as the head of the Small Business Association. Mr. Lutnick is the chairman and C.E.O. of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Linda McMahon, the former head of the Small Business Administration, speaks during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis., in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Howard Lutnick, chairman and chief executive officer of Cantor Fitzgerald LP, in New York in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>A Trump campaign statement announcing their selection also lists as “honorary chairs” of the transition the former president’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio. Donald Trump Jr. has expressed an interest in ensuring that people disloyal to his father are not selected for jobs in a second Trump administration.</p></div><div><div><p>Mr. Trump had delayed the transition operation process because he is superstitious and dismisses any discussion of transition planning as a distraction from winning the election, according to people who have broached the matter with him. He only begrudgingly agreed to this late formation of a team, they said.</p><p>“It is late in the day to be initiating transition preparation,” said Max Stier, the C.E.O. of the Partnership for Public Service, the nonpartisan group that runs the main organization focused on effective presidential transitions.</p><p>“The modern norms are to begin transitions in the spring of the election year, so we are now four months behind schedule,” Mr. Stier said. “The consequences are significant, because the requirements of transition are huge. You’re taking over the largest, most complex and important organization in our country, probably our planet, and probably in history.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Swan is a political reporter covering the 2024 presidential election and Donald Trump’s campaign.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-swan">More about Jonathan Swan</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
