But February typically draws fewer than 50,000 visitors. That makes winter the best time to beat the crowds, as well as to experience a captivating and seldom-seen world revealed only when the park is covered in snow.</p><p>In winter, wildlife shows up in stark relief against an undulating sea of white. The roar of bus engines and clatter of motorcycles are replaced by the hiss and gurgle of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/hydrothermal-features.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flaring fumaroles and bubbling mud pots</a>, and the quiet crunch of snow underfoot.</p><p>Winter weather varies from blue-sky days in the 30s to whiteout blizzards at 20 below zero, with conditions that are often comparable to those at any Rocky Mountain ski hill. Traveling with a group is important for safety, along with dressing warmly in layers and wearing insulated, waterproof boots and gloves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Yellowstone’s winter season runs from mid-December to early March, with activities — which are all about the snow — ranging from mild to wild. Bring a separate camera with a telephoto lens, and always give animals plenty of space. Then brag to everyone about why your winter adventure was so much better than their summer visit to the world’s first national park.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Snow coaches with oversize, low-pressure tires give visitors a warm, comfy way to tour Yellowstone and, in some cases, to reach their accommodations.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jacob W.

You can opt for a tour run by <a href="https://www.xanterra.com/stories/yellowstone-snowcoaches-the-ultimate-ticket-to-ride/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Xanterra Travel Collection</a>, and stay overnight at the <a href="https://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/lodgings/cabin/old-faithful-snow-lodge-cabins-summer/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Old Faithful Snow Lodge</a> ($457 a night), which the company manages. From there, choose from six different round-trip tours (from $84), including a stargazing jaunt and a photo safari. Snow Lodge guests must book separate travel to and from the hotel (from $174 one-way). Round-trip tours also depart from Mammoth Hot Springs (from $134).</p><p>The only hotel in the park’s interior open during winter, the Snow Lodge sits in Yellowstone’s <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/exploreoldfaithful.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Upper Geyser Basin</a>, surrounded by walking paths and cross-country ski trails that wind among more than 150 geysers within one square mile. The lodge, which has 100 rooms and 34 cabins, is accessible only by snow coach or snowmobile, but guests need not arrive via Xanterra’s transportation.</p><p>The lodge is “one of Yellowstone’s hidden secrets,” said Paul Brown, 50, a winter trip leader for <a href="https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/yellowstone-winter-active-wildlife-tour/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wilderness Travel</a> (seven-day small-group tours from $8,695 per person). “It’s a truly special experience actually being there for those quiet times when you can just hang out in the geyser basin and no one else is around.”</p><p>While you’re at the lodge, take a late-night walk under the Milky Way with a hot chocolate, or one at sunrise with a cappuccino, to watch the Old Faithful Geyser, about 800 feet away, erupt approximately every 90 minutes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guests at the Yellowstone Expeditions Yurt Camp can explore the backcountry on cross-country skis with guides or on their own, using the camp as a home base.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jacob W.

Guests travel 40 miles by snow coach from West Yellowstone, Mont., and once there, they can ski on their own or in small groups with guides, taking daily snow coach shuttles to and from more distant trailheads.</p><p>Skiers sleep in one of eight heated private “yurtlets” (single or double occupancy) and dine family-style in a larger, communal yurt, all situated a mile from the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-grand-canyon-of-the-yellowstone.htm#:~:text=The%20current%20canyon%20begins%20at,Falls%20flows%20over%20similar%20rocks." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River</a>. The rustic camp has solar power for lights and to charge devices, and features a sauna, a shower and a heated shared outhouse.

A trip with <a href="https://garyfalesoutfitting.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gary Fales Outfitting</a> over Sylvan Pass, at 8,524 feet, serves up sweeping views of the vast, frozen expanse of <a href="https://www.yellowstone.org/winter-song/#:~:text=In%20the%20wintertime,%20ice%20on,lake%20from%20fully%20freezing%20over." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yellowstone Lake</a>.</p><p>Gary Fales Outfitting also offers small-group day tours to Old Faithful or the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone ($400 per snowmobile, carrying one or two guests), which include all specialized gear, while two- and three-day options (from $1,875 per snowmobile) offer a choice of overnight hotel stays inside or outside the park.</p><p>Yellowstone is “a whole different world when it’s solid white and dead calm and quiet,” said Brian McDaniel, 54, a Cody, Wyo., resident. “You can go for miles and not see another person,” he said, listing river otters, wolves and “foxes diving into four-foot snowdrifts to hunt” among his favorite wildlife sightings.</p><p>If you’re an experienced rider, you can rent snowmobiles and gear for a self-guided tour, but you will need planning and a little luck to secure dates: The National Park Service holds a <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/250849" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lottery</a> every August for the following winter.

The eight-hour tours are suitable for beginners and can be geared to any fitness level, although walks are at elevations of 6,000 feet and above, so plan accordingly.</p><p>Expert field educators lead hikers and share details about Yellowstone’s winter ecology, evolving landscapes and connections to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/science/yellowstone-indigenous-people-obsidian.html" title="">Indigenous people</a>.
