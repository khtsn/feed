</span> 2-0.</p>

<p>The two-map series was played out on Sunset, Haven, and Icebox, with Sentinels picking Sunset, DRX picking Haven and Icebox being the decider.</p>

<p>Sunset finished 15-13, and Haven was 13-8, leaving Icebox unnecessary.</p>

<p>In their two-map victory over Gen.G, Sentinels won all four bonus rounds off of four pistol rounds. On Wednesday, won just one pistol round and no bonuses.</p>

<p>One of the viewing points of map one was <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4004/zekken">
		zekken	</a>
</span>&#39;s VCT debut on Neon, which included an ace in the first half, his first in an international competition this year.</p>


<p><em>An ace for SEN zekken on Sunset.</em></p>

<p>The five-kill round secured a fifth straight round for his team after trailing 2-0.</p>

<p>He gathered the most kills in the server on the map, finishing 27-23, with eight of those kills being first-bloods. He&#39;d even go 8-3 on <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span>, the opposition Neon.</p>

<p>The second half of the map, Sentinels&#39; attacking half, was tight. Several rounds finished with only one player standing.</p>

<p>Up 11-7 and two rounds away from sealing the map, the script was flipped on Sentinels. DRX found five straight rounds to reach map point, but a lost 5v3 brought both teams to overtime.</p>

<p>Eventually, Sentinels escaped their map pick by the skin of their teeth, 15-13.</p>

<p>“It could have gone our way if we stayed calm, so I told the players to stay more calm and collected. Relax a little bit, take it slow,” DRX head coach <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/775/termi">
		termi	</a>
</span> said following the map.</p>

<p>On Haven, Zekken again played Neon, seemingly looking to ride off of the confidence from the last map.</p>

<p>Strong defensive protocols, along with excellent control of the map, highlighted DRX&#39;s successes in the first half. They showed little sign of being shaken, claiming six rounds in what&#39;s widely believed to be an attack-sided map.</p>

<p>However, their attack half went differently. Sentinels seemed to have a read on DRX&#39;s attack processes, with a standout of their defense being their ability to hold A site.</p>

<p>A flawless round 19, which included a triple kill from zekken, brought Sentinels to match point.</p>


<p><em>Sentinels hold A site flawlessly to reach match point.</em></p>

<p>They claimed six of the first seven rounds in the half to reach match point, and made quick work of DRX to win 13-8.</p>

<p>“I thought [a win] was still achievable through every second of the [second] map, but when it was 7-12 and we had one person alive and they had four, that&#39;s when I felt it was over,” DRX&#39;s Foxy9 said following the match.</p>

<p>After beating both Korean teams in the competition, Sentinels head coach <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/757/kaplan">
		kaplan	</a>
</span> spoke on the similarities between the two.</p>

<p>“I think they&#39;re very similar. I think they both have a pretty structured way of playing. They don&#39;t have a ton of setups or plays, they prefer running the same stuff more frequently,” he said.</p>

<p>Sentinels&#39; Zekken finished with a server-leading 54 kills, while DRX&#39;s <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/35013/flashback">
		Flashback	</a>
</span> finished with a team-leading 39.</p>

<p>“I was just feeling really Filipino today, so I played the Filipino character,” Zekken said jokingly when asked why the team chose to play him on Neon. “We&#39;ve had Neon in our back pocket for a while. We have a good amount of prep with her and I&#39;m feeling very confident with her as of late so we used her and it worked out well.”</p>

<p>DRX are the last remaining team from the Pacific region in Champions Seoul after Gen.G, <span data-ref-id="8">
