Israel’s military has flattened entire Lebanese districts. And through it all, the airline, known to locals by the abbreviation MEA, has continued flying, sometimes just minutes after bombs have pummeled the road leading to Beirut’s international airport. It is the only commercial airline still operating in and out of Lebanon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In a country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/magazine/corruption-lebanon.html" title="">hollowed out</a> by corrupt leaders, with no army strong enough to defend it, MEA has become a source of pride for a population with few champions left to cheer.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/multimedia/17lebanon-airline-add-01-jvgh/17lebanon-airline-add-01-jvgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/multimedia/17lebanon-airline-add-01-jvgh/17lebanon-airline-add-01-jvgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/17/multimedia/17lebanon-airline-add-01-jvgh/17lebanon-airline-add-01-jvgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A room with multiple screens.

Officials heap it with praise. And even as some passengers complain of soaring prices, countless accounts on Lebanese social media have waxed lyrical.</p><p>“Heroes of the sky,” one person <a href="https://x.com/sakr_maggie/status/1848379116049109211" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a>.</p><p>“We are steadfast and gallant, like the gallantry of the Lebanese Middle East Airlines that flies above Israeli bombing,” a prominent Muslim cleric <a href="https://x.com/imammoraib/status/1848121009016123699" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p><p>It is all a bit much for Mohammed Aziz, a spokesman for the airline, who is eager to manage expectations: “We are not the military. We are not heroes. We are a commercial airline,” Mr. Aziz, a former MEA captain, told The New York Times.</p><p>Yet MEA could be considered a metaphor for resilience throughout the history of a nation that has known too many wars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It managed to fly through the 1967 and 1973 regional wars, as well as the 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. It kept flying during the 1982 Israeli invasion, and Israel’s 2006 war with Hezbollah.</p><p>MEA has become a rare success story in Lebanon — it has remained largely profitable — in spite of the country’s repeated collapse into crises.</p><p>“We always have Plan A, B, C, D and even E,” Mr. Aziz said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke rising over the Dahiya, an area on the southern outskirts of Beirut, this month as nearby airport lights glow.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since Israel launched its invasion, the key to keeping planes safe has been a “crisis unit” established by MEA and the country’s Civil Aviation Authority, said Mazen Sammak, the head of Lebanon’s private pilot association and an airline safety consultant. They assess every flight, he said, and if a risk is perceived, they either delay takeoffs or tell pilots nearing Lebanon to slow their approach until it is safer to land.</p><p>“Up to now, we’ve had what has become a famous phrase: assurances, but no guarantees,” he said. “These are not normal circumstances to fly or operate an airport — you can’t find another airport worldwide operating with shelling hitting 500 meters away from it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The airline’s persistence has helped give this tiny Mediterranean nation — surrounded by Syria, Israel and the sea — a sense that it is not wholly cut off from the world.</p><p>“As long as the airport is open, it means we’re not totally screwed,” said Makram Rabah, a historian at the American University of Beirut. “There’s a Mediterranean element here. People living in the Mediterranean always like to venture out: Whether it was our seafaring ancestors, or our modern form of transport, by air. You cannot disconnect Lebanon from the world.”</p><p>It is not just the Lebanese who see the flagship carrier as that symbolic link — so did Israel, said Mr. Rabah, who writes about modern Lebanese history.</p><p>He pointed to Israel’s 1968 raid on the Beirut airport <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v20/d369" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in retaliation for</a> the hijacking of an Israeli plane, led by Palestinian militants based in Lebanon. Israel blew up more than half of the MEA fleet, though the privately owned airline had no known links to the hijacking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An MEA plane that was damaged after a 1968 Israeli raid.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rolls Press, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>MEA was actually able to recover its losses because of an enterprising decision to buy risk <a href="https://time.com/archive/6635688/middle-east-gold-in-the-ashes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insurance</a> — not for Middle Eastern conflicts, but to continue flights to India and Pakistan during a 1965 war between those nations.</p><p>The airline, like the nation it represents, was a source of international fascination as early as the 1960s — a period seen as Lebanon’s glamorous heyday, when it was a playground for celebrities and playboys who arrived on yachts and private jets.</p><p>Time magazine <a href="https://time.com/archive/6626797/middle-east-the-flying-sheik/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">marveled at the company’s success</a> in a region of heavily subsidized, government-owned national carriers, calling it “the most successful Arab aerial enterprise since the flying carpet.”</p><p>The publication gave the airline’s chief executive at the time, Najib Alamuddin, the nickname the “flying sheikh.” Mr. Alamuddin, a Druse man with the religious title sheikh, even used it as the title of his autobiography.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli troops attending a departure ceremony at Beirut airport in September 1982.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Max Nash/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Within Lebanon, Mr. Alamuddin, who died in 1996, became the first of many MEA executives thrust into the unlikely role of national negotiator to protect the airline, Mr. Aziz said. Mr. Alamuddin met with the country’s constantly shifting constellation of militant factions, Mr. Aziz said, to ensure they did not attack the airline.</p><p>“Back then, it was a little more risky. We had to coordinate with 30 different factions,” Mr. Aziz said. “It was really much more difficult than now, with only two parties,” he said — Israel and Hezbollah.</p><p>Today’s chairman, Mohammed al-Hout, has mostly negotiated with the United States Embassy, which communicates with Israel, and with Lebanese officials close to Hezbollah, Mr. Aziz said. That is to ensure that the militant group refrains from trying to use the airport, and that Israel does not attack it. Mr. al-Hout declined to be interviewed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Passengers awaiting their flights in August.

We have quite a lot of experience in this,” he said. “It’s what makes people trust our risk assessment.”</p><p>From the civil war until today, MEA has operated through conflict with a careful and ever-changing orchestration of flights that ensures only a certain number of planes are on the ground in Beirut at any given time, to distribute insurance risks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene after Israeli airstrikes this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>After Israel attacked and invaded Lebanon in 1982, Mr. Aziz was among the pilots who flew the airline’s jets to Cyprus, taking off using only half of the runway to avoid sections cratered by bombs.
