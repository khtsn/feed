			<p>The match-fixing history of Viva happened when he was still a CSGO professional player, and he is totally clean in vlr career, which is different from YOU. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to accuse a vlr player for his misbehavior in another esports, especially considering that his misbehavior didn&#39;t cause severe consequences. The boxing should be contained and stopped, because each event has its unique problems, and it&#39;s long-known that CSGO esports sucks in some area, including China. At the same time, please do not blame all problems on the Chinese management system.</p>
<p>Viva的假赛问题发生在他仍是CSGO职业选手的时候，而他作为一个valorant职业选手是完全清白的，这是和YOU不一样的。我不认为跨项目对选手进行清算是合理的行为，尤其是考虑到viva当时的行为并未造成严重的后果。这种开盒和清算行为必须有所克制并适时停止，毕竟不同的电竞项目有不同的特点，中国CSGO的电竞生态有多烂相信大家都清楚。同时也不要把所有问题都归罪到中国的体制。</p>		</div>
