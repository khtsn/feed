			<p>Makes sense. Teams like Apeks and KOI need basically a full rebuild. Luckily T2 in Europe is full of brutal talents... and they are all so young. You can find so many 17-19 years young talents and that&#39;s literally the ideal age to form absolute beasts with the right coaches.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure until 2028 the skill base level and also the skill ceiling of VCT will rise further.</p>		</div>

		<p>Why are you letting go of MONSTEERR and not Filu? I mean he was a little inconsistent but he still performed well and looked like the best player on Koi at times. Feels like such a waste for them to get rid of him.</p>

			<p>Luckily neither of those things is actually accurate. All KOI players and staff are gone for next year including Filu and flyuh, it&#39;s just that they still have a contract and are restricted free agents instead of being fully gone like the others whose contracts run out.</p>
<p>Monster tho is different, he&#39;s not leaving, at least not yet. He is in serious consideration to stay next year they&#39;re simply letting him explore oportunities while they make their decision. They don&#39;t wanna commit to anyone just yet. The roster is totally blank for Yaba but that does not mean he doesn&#39;t choose to keep Monster</p>		</div>

			<p>Fuck Koi first they drop the only 3 good players on their team instead of fly0h and f0l0 and then they drop all the new players</p>
<p>resign sheydos or forever go 0-5 in regional stages</p>		</div>

		<p>yeah ik its just that I have a burning resentment for koi for dropping the three good players mid season instead of the two bumrats </p>

	<div data-post-id="5367764">
		
		
		<p>If only you read up on their contracts instead of spouting nonsense, you&#39;d understand that their contracts have ended. That&#39;s why they are in free agency, while the two bums are still on the team are going to be in the same position as soon as their contracts run out.</p>
