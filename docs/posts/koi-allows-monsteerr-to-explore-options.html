		<p>Why are you letting go of MONSTEERR and not Filu? I mean he was a little inconsistent but he still performed well and looked like the best player on Koi at times. Feels like such a waste for them to get rid of him.</p>

			<p>Luckily neither of those things is actually accurate. All KOI players and staff are gone for next year including Filu and flyuh, it&#39;s just that they still have a contract and are restricted free agents instead of being fully gone like the others whose contracts run out.</p>
<p>Monster tho is different, he&#39;s not leaving, at least not yet. He is in serious consideration to stay next year they&#39;re simply letting him explore oportunities while they make their decision. They don&#39;t wanna commit to anyone just yet. The roster is totally blank for Yaba but that does not mean he doesn&#39;t choose to keep Monster</p>		</div>

			<p>Fuck Koi first they drop the only 3 good players on their team instead of fly0h and f0l0 and then they drop all the new players</p>
<p>resign sheydos or forever go 0-5 in regional stages</p>		</div>

		<p>yeah ik its just that I have a burning resentment for koi for dropping the three good players mid season instead of the two bumrats </p>
