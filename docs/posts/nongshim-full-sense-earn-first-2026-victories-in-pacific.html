</span> to move on in the upper bracket. Both matches were one-sided, as Team Secret only won thirteen rounds on both maps, and ZETA struggled its way to only six total round wins in the series.</p>



<p>The series started with Team Secret&#39;s pick of Haven, as Nongshim opted for double-Duelist while Team Secret ran double-Controller. Nongshim started hot with a pistol round win, and despite a failed bonus round conversion, the lead ballooned to 7-1. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/31827/dambi">
		Dambi	</a>
</span>, moving back to his signature Neon, was frying his opponents early on in the series.</p>


<p><em>Dambi gets four against Team Secret on Haven.</em></p>

<p>Reaching the half up 9-3, Nongshim were clinical in the second half too. After winning the second pistol and converting the bonus round, Team Secret needed a big comeback on map one, but the hopes were dashed. After reaching map point up 12-3, it only took three rounds for Nongshim to finish Haven 13-5.</p>

<p>Now, Team Secret needed to fight back on Nongshim&#39;s map pick of Split. Both teams opted for double-Duelist here, with Secret running Waylay while Nongshim stuck with Neon and Yoru. Secret started strong on the attack side, winning the first pistol and converting the bonus. TenTen and BeserX were stepping up, and despite some fight from Nongshim toward the end of the half, Secret had the 7-5 lead.</p>

<p>However, double-Duelist always shines on the attack side. Moving to the attack side, Nongshim won the second pistol and converted its own bonus round, shifting the momentum heavily. One of the biggest signs of life from Nongshim was new acquisition <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/42772/xross">
		Xross	</a>
</span> nailing key shots to take the team&#39;s first map lead.</p>


<p><em>Xross gets three entry kills on Split against Team Secret.</em></p>

<p>That lead stretched to 12-7, and even after Secret got its first defense round win, it was followed up by a Nongshim series win, ending Split 13-8. </p>

<p>Dambi was the player of the series,  with his move back to Neon doing wonders, ending with a 1.56 match rating and 41 kills. With the win, Nongshim will face <span data-ref-id="6">

ZETA won the first pistol, but could not convert the bonus round. Just as FS tied the map early, the signs of a two-man star performance started to show. Both primmie and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13784/killua">
		Killua	</a>
</span> were great defensively, going on a run to take a 5-2 lead and eventually end the half up 8-4. Then, when FS won the second pistol, it was only a matter of time. After some more great shots from primmie, FS won the map 13-4.</p>


<p><em>primmie nearly aces on the bonus round against ZETA on Corrode.</em></p>

<p>Then, it was ZETA&#39;s map pick of Split, which needed to be an improvement from the mainly Japanese squad. Both teams ran more double-Duelist, with some slight variation. FS ran Raze, which seems to be a rarer pick by the day, while ZETA stuck to Neon and Yoru. FS won the first pistol, and despite losing the bonus round, never looked back. ZETA looked demoralized as FS reached a 10-1 lead, entering the half up 10-2. </p>

<p>If ZETA had any hope for a comeback, it needed a pistol win, but it wasn&#39;t meant to be. FULL SENSE won Split 13-2, with <span data-ref-id="9">
