As of Sunday afternoon, it was completely uncontained, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>“We’ve been running our folks ragged,” Bill Donnelly, chief of the Forest Fire Service, said at a news conference on Sunday.</p><p>The unseasonably dry conditions in New Jersey and the rough terrain were making the wildfire difficult to extinguish, Chief Donnelly said, adding that the fire was spreading both aboveground and through decaying root systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He said that the expected rain would not be sufficient to put out the blaze, which was reported on Saturday in a remote area near West Milford, on the border with New York, but that firefighters hoped to contain it by the end of the coming week.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/09/multimedia/09NYC-Fire-Smell-cbjt/09NYC-Fire-Smell-cbjt-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Firefighters in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut battled hundreds of blazes during an unseasonably dry fall.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Benjamin Norman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>An 18-year-old employee of the New York State parks system <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/nyregion/orange-county-fire-sterling-forest.html" title="">died on Saturday</a> while fighting the fire. The employee, Dariel Vasquez, was helping to clear a wooded area when a tree fell and hit him, officials said.</p><p>Since early October, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has responded to 537 wildfires in the state, about 500 more than in the same period last year, Chief Donnelly said. Some of the fires have been burning since July, he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/nyregion/new-jersey-connecticut-wildfires-drought.html" title="">Hundreds of fires</a> have burned across the region this fall during an unusually warm and dry season. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/nyregion/prospect-park-fire.html" title="">A brush fire in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park</a> on Friday night blanketed New York City in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/nyregion/fire-smoke-nj-prospect-park-brooklyn.html" title="">smoky smell</a> over the weekend that permeated the streets and seeped into apartment buildings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>By Sunday morning, the air quality in the New York metropolitan region had improved, as winds blew the smoke from New Jersey’s wildfires more toward upstate New York instead of the city, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>But an air quality advisory was still <a href="https://extapps.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/aqi/aqi_forecast.cfm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in effect</a> for the New York City area and the lower and upper Hudson Valley — meaning <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/air-quality/air-quality-index-forecast-current-observations" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain groups</a>, including children and older adults, were advised to spend less time outdoors or avoid strenuous outdoor activities.</p><p>On Sunday evening, the region is expected to have its first measurable rainfall since late September, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>Still, only a quarter- to a half-inch of rain is expected by Monday morning, an amount unlikely to make a significant impact on drought conditions, meteorologists said. October was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/weather/new-york-city-dry-october.html" title="">driest month in New York City history</a>.</p><p>“That type of rain is not really going to make a huge difference, but given that we haven’t had rain at all, any little bit will help,” said David Stark, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>New York City is under its first drought watch in more than 20 years — a level that could escalate to a warning, and then to an emergency, if the city’s reservoirs do not fill up to normal levels. A drought emergency could lead the city to impose mandatory restrictions on water use.</p><p>The city has been experiencing an unusually high number of smaller brush fires, officials said, with 120 fires in a recent 10-day span.</p><p>Investigators were still examining the cause of the fire in Prospect Park, which burned about two acres and was extinguished by firefighters after three hours. The fire had been reported to the authorities by a bystander.</p><p>In central New Jersey, a man was <a href="https://ocponj.gov/brick-township-man-charged-with-arson-and-violation-of-regulatory-provisions-relating-to-firearms-in-connection-with-jackson-township-wildfire/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charged with arson</a> on Friday after he was accused of firing an illegal type of ammunition at a shooting range that set off a wildfire in Jackson Township. The fire, which broke out Wednesday and took about two days to contain, burned through 350 acres and forced the evacuation of 15 homes, the authorities said.</p><p>The National Park Service has <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously said</a> that nearly 85 percent of wildfires in the United States are caused by humans, including by unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes and intentional arson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A study <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/climate/extreme-wildfires-have-doubled-in-2-decades-study-finds.html" title="">published this year</a> found that the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires have more than doubled in the last two decades, driven by a hotter and drier climate.</p><p>“Extreme weather has become the new normal,” said Zach Iscol, New York City’s commissioner of emergency management. “When people think about climate change, they think about rising sea levels or catastrophic amounts of rain, but it manifests in a lot of ways.”</p><p>On Saturday, Mayor Eric Adams of New York <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/822-24/mayor-adams-bans-grilling-parks-reminds-new-yorkers-take-additional-precautions-conserve" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced a new ban</a> on grilling in the city’s parks and urged residents to conserve water voluntarily, including by taking shorter showers, flushing the toilet only when necessary and fixing leaky faucets.</p><p>In Connecticut, officials responded to 12 new fires this weekend, and the fire danger level on Sunday was “extreme,” according to a spokesman for the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Some state parks were closed as a result of the fires.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicole Hong is an investigative reporter, focused on covering New York and its surrounding regions.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicole-hong">More about Nicole Hong</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hilary Howard is a Times reporter covering how the New York City region is adapting to climate change and other environmental challenges.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hilary-howard">More about Hilary Howard</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>14</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>New York and New Jersey Fire Causes a Death<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
