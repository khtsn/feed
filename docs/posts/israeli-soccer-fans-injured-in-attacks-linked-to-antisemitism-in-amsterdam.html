The statement did not say what had touched off the violence, the exact circumstances of which remained unclear.</p><p>The Dutch police said <a href="https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2024/november/8/05-57-aanhoudingen-rondom-de-voetbalwedstrijd-ajax---maccabi-tel-aviv-fc.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier</a> that the clashes, which began Thursday, took place in areas where people had gathered, some in support of the Israeli team and others to protest its arrival, creating a tense atmosphere.</p><p>Israel’s Foreign Ministry said at least 10 Israeli citizens had been hurt in the violence and two others were missing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that his government would help in “providing civilian aviation solutions” for injured Israelis, and that he had spoken with Prime Minister Dick Schoof of the Netherlands.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A spokeswoman for the Israeli airline El Al said that it would “operate on short notice rescue flights” free of charge from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv starting Friday afternoon.</p><p>Gideon Saar, Israel’s newly appointed foreign minister, said he would travel to the Netherlands on Friday to meet with his Dutch counterpart as well as with Israelis and members of the Jewish community.</p><p>The police did not comment on the reports that people were missing. Mr. Schoof said in a <a href="https://x.com/MinPres/status/1854768172211065248" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> early Friday that there had been antisemitic attacks on Israelis in Amsterdam, calling them “completely unacceptable.”</p><p>He added that the situation had calmed and that he had told Mr. Netanyahu in their phone conversation that the perpetrators would be found and prosecuted.</p><p>Earlier on Friday, the Israeli government said it would send military planes to rescue its citizens, but Mr. Netanyahu’s office said later that “it was decided that deploying a professional rescue team to the Netherlands was unnecessary.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Videos circulating on social media and a video distributed by The Associated Press provide a glimpse of the tensions in the hours leading up to the violence. In the A.P. clip, dozens of men wearing scarves with the colors of the Israeli soccer club, Maccabi Tel Aviv, are seen gathering on Thursday at Amsterdam’s central Dam Square, where flares are being lit amid a heavy police presence.</p><p>Later, in nighttime footage that has circulated on social media and was verified by The New York Times, a large group of men wearing similar Maccabi paraphernalia are seen being escorted by police at Amsterdam’s Centraal train station. Riding down escalators, they are heard using expletives in an anti-Arab chant in Hebrew.</p><p>The Israeli Embassy in the Netherlands said that hundreds of Maccabi fans, who were in Amsterdam to see their team play against Ajax, Amsterdam’s soccer team, were being ambushed for hours on Thursday evening into early Friday.</p><p>“Mobs chanted anti-Israel slogans and proudly shared videos of their violent acts on social media — kicking, beating, even running over Israeli citizens,” the embassy said on <a href="https://x.com/IsraelinNL/status/1854773621249786333" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p><p>As the attacks went on, Israel warned its citizens in Amsterdam to stay off the streets and remain in their hotel rooms. Maccabi Tel Aviv warned people not to show Israeli or Jewish symbols outside, and to fly back to Israel as soon as they could.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Our main goal is the safe and quick return of the fans to Israel,” the team wrote on <a href="https://x.com/MaccabiTLVFC/status/1854764918589079856" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p><p>Videos on social media showed violent clashes on the city’s streets. One <a href="https://x.com/iAnnetnl/status/1854664685469028610" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> verified by Reuters captured a crowd of more than a dozen men appearing to attack someone near the city center early Friday. The crowd dispersed when emergency sirens could be heard.</p><p>Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, <a href="https://x.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/1854771676891791407" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that the images and videos of the violence were of the sort that “we had hoped never to see again.”</p><p>The Dutch police said that some of the unrest took place at or near the Johan Cruyff Arena, where the soccer game was played.</p><p>Hundreds of Maccabi supporters had gathered in Amsterdam’s center early Thursday afternoon, where the atmosphere was initially tense but gradually became calmer, the police said in the statement. Ten people were arrested there before the game, the police said, mostly on charges of disrupting the public order.</p><p>At another square called Anton de Komplein, which is near the stadium, people protesting the arrival of Maccabi Tel Aviv clashed with the police after trying to make their way to the stadium. Amsterdam’s mayor, Femke Halsema, had earlier prohibited the protest from happening at the stadium and ordered it to take place at that square.</p><p>About 30 people were arrested in that confrontation on charges of disrupting the public order and setting off fireworks at the police, the police said.</p><p>Qasim Nauman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nadav Gavrielov<!-- -->, <!-- -->Claire Moses<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nader Ibrahim<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aritz Parra<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Sports</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping professional, collegiate and amateur athletics.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Watching the World Series: </strong>Little Toyko restaurants in Los Angeles and New York bodegas were among the places that moonlighted as sports bars as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/10/29/nyregion/dodgers-yankees-fans-watch-world-series">fans in both cities sought communal viewing experiences</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>College Football Is Big Business: </strong>Players are dealing with far-flung travel, jet lag and the pressures of trying to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/college-football-conference-realignment.html">balance the roles of student, athlete and entrepreneur</a> more than ever before.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remembering Fernandomania: </strong>Fernando Valenzuela, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/sports/fernando-valenzuela-dead.html">who died at age 63</a>, was a teenage phenomenon from Mexico who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/style/fernando-valenzuela-fernandomania.html">remade the Dodgers’ fan base</a> and put his country on the baseball map.</p></li><li><p><strong>N.Y.C.’s Long Wait Ends: </strong>The Liberty, one of the original W.N.B.A. teams, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/nyregion/new-york-liberty-champions.html">finally won their first championship</a>, and New York got its first basketball title in 48 years.</p></li><li><p><strong>The N.F.L.’s $20 Billion Man: </strong>Under the expansionist leadership of its commissioner, Roger Goodell, the league is growing richer. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/business/roger-goodell-nfl.html">So, too, is Goodell</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
