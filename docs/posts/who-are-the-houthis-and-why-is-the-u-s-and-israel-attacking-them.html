They overran the Yemeni capital, Sana, in 2014, forcing the country’s internationally recognized government to flee to the southern city of Aden.</p><p>A Saudi-led coalition launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/25/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-yemen-houthis-gaza.html" title="">a military intervention</a> to oust the militants but failed, leaving the Houthis in power in northern Yemen, in a civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands and led to one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/magazine/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html" title="">world’s worst humanitarian crises</a>.</p><p>The Houthis are opposed to Israel and the United States. They see themselves as part of the Iranian-led “axis of resistance,” along with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>Their ideology is reflected in the slogan on the group’s flag: “Allah is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, victory to Islam.” Their leaders often draw parallels between the American-made bombs used to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/arms-deals-raytheon-yemen.html" title="">pummel their forces in Yemen</a> and the arms <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/09/us-weapons-israel-gaza/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent to Israel</a> and used in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Models of Houthi-made drones on display in Yemen’s capital, Sana, last January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yahya Arhab/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Once a group of poorly organized rebels, the Houthis in recent years have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/world/middleeast/yemen-houthis-gulf.html" title="">bolstered their arsenal</a>, which now includes cruise and ballistic missiles and long-range drones.

But the Houthi <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/houthi-shipping-attacks-patterns-and-expectations-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criteria for attacking ships</a> quickly expanded to include vessels with direct or indirect links to Israel or past visits to Israeli ports, then also to ships with ties to the United States or Britain. Many of the subsequent attacks have been indiscriminate, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12301" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a report</a> from the Congressional Research Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yahya Sarea, a Houthi spokesman, making a statement last January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yahya Arhab/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Houthis have launched more than 130 attacks with drones and missiles on vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a nonprofit group that tracks the strikes. </p><p>Perhaps the most audacious Houthi operation came in November 2023, when gunmen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/19/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-houthis-hijacked-red-sea-ship.html?smid=url-share" title="">hijacked a vessel</a> named the Galaxy Leader and took it to a Yemeni port, where they have been <a href="https://www.worldcargonews.com/news/2024/11/one-year-after-hijacking-mv-galaxy-leader-still-held-in-yemen/?gdpr=accept" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holding the ship’s crew members</a> captive for more than a year.</p><p>In August, a Houthi attack on an oil tanker carrying the equivalent of about one million barrels of crude oil <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/world/middleeast/oil-tanker-red-sea-yemen-houthi-attack.html" title="">threatened to become an environmental disaster</a> as the vessel burned for weeks.

It said the targets included a command and control facility and centers for weapons production and storage. </p><h2 id="link-78fa6ddf">What has Israel done?</h2><p>For years, the Houthis were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-houthis-yemen.html" title="">the enemy most Israelis didn’t know they had</a>.</p><p>Now a militia over a thousand miles from Israel is keeping the country up at night with a string of attacks. </p><p>At first, the threat to Israel appeared distant. Houthi attack drones would take about 10 hours to reach Israel’s southern port of Eilat. Along with the occasional ballistic missile, they were often intercepted far from Israel’s territory or airspace with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/us/politics/us-houthi-missile-strikes.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">help of international forces</a> in the Persian Gulf region. Many Israelis regarded them as a somewhat bizarre nuisance.</p><p>But a drone fired by the Houthis in July took a different route. Flying in from the west over the Mediterranean coast, it evaded Israel’s defenses and slammed into an apartment building in Tel Aviv, the country’s commercial center, killing one man and wounding several other people. </p><p>On Thursday, after Israel struck Yemen for a second time in the month of December, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview with local news media that Israel was “just getting started” responding to the Houthis.</p><p>Israel Katz, Israel’s defense minister, on Thursday reiterated a threat he had made earlier about Israel’s intent to assassinate Houthi leaders. “We will hunt down all the Houthi leaders, hit them as we have done elsewhere,” Mr. Katz said. “No one will be able to escape Israel’s long arm.”</p><p>Israel is apparently turning more attention to the Houthis now, after reaching a cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah in November and largely undermining Hamas’s capabilities in Gaza over more than a year of war.</p><p>But Israel’s security establishment has never prioritized Yemen and has not expended efforts in gathering intelligence on the Houthis over the years, experts say.</p><p>In response to Israel’s attack, Mohammed Abdulsalam, a Houthi spokesman, said that targeting civilian infrastructure was “a Zionist crime against the entire Yemeni people.” He added that Israeli strikes won’t “deter Yemen from supporting Gaza.&#34;</p><p>Isabel Kershner<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ismaeel Naar is an international reporter for The Times, covering the Gulf states.
