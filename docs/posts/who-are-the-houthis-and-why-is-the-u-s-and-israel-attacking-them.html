It was Israel’s fourth attack in Yemen over the past year and came just a week after Israel last struck.</p><p>The United States and Britain have also retaliated against the Houthis to protect international waterways. The U.S. military on Saturday said that it had targeted Houthi facilities in Yemen.</p><p>Here’s what to know about the Houthis, their attacks on ships and their conflict with Israel.</p><h2 id="link-25cd5208">Who are the Houthis?</h2><p>The Houthis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/world/middleeast/houthis-red-sea-yemen-israel.html" title="">Shiite</a> militants who have been fighting Yemen’s government for about two decades, overran the Yemeni capital, Sana, in 2014, forcing the country’s internationally recognized government to flee to the southern city of Aden.</p><p>A Saudi-led coalition launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/25/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-yemen-houthis-gaza.html" title="">a military intervention</a> to oust the militants but failed, leaving the Houthis in power in northern Yemen, ruling most of the population and igniting a civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands and led to one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/magazine/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html" title="">world’s worst humanitarian crises</a>.</p><p>The Houthis have built their ideology around opposition to Israel and the United States, seeing themselves as part of the Iranian-led “axis of resistance,” along with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Their ideology is reflected in the slogan on the group’s flag: “Allah is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, victory to Islam.” Their leaders often draw parallels between the American-made bombs used to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/us/arms-deals-raytheon-yemen.html" title="">pummel their forces in Yemen</a> and the arms <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/09/us-weapons-israel-gaza/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent to Israel</a> and used in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Models of Houthi-made drones on display in Yemen’s capital, Sana, in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yahya Arhab/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Talks between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in September 2023 raised hopes for a peace deal that would potentially recognize the Houthis’ right to govern northern Yemen. In December 2023, the United Nations announced that the warring parties had agreed on a road map for peace, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/06/world/middleeast/yemen-peace-deal.html" title="">progress was frozen</a> soon after when the internationally recognized Yemeni government, backed by Saudi Arabia, said it was suspending the deal’s implementation, citing Houthi escalation in the Red Sea.</p><p>Once a group of poorly organized rebels, the Houthis in recent years have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/world/middleeast/yemen-houthis-gulf.html" title="">bolstered their arsenal</a>, which now includes cruise and ballistic missiles and long-range drones. Analysts credit this expansion to support from Iran, which has supplied militias across the Middle East.</p><h2 id="link-7ab44730">Does the U.S. consider the Houthis a terror group?</h2><p>The Trump administration <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/terrorist-designation-of-ansarallah-in-yemen/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initially labeled the Houthis</a> a terrorist organization in 2021, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-mistake-of-designating-the-houthis-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shortly before</a> former President Donald J.

Early this year, the State Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/us/politics/houthis-terrorism-designation.html" title="">announced that it was reimposing the label</a> in view of the Houthi attacks on ships.</p><p>The terrorist designation allows Washington to impose financial penalties and criminally prosecute anyone who knowingly provides a labeled group with “material support,” and the Treasury Department has been trying to pressure the Houthis by cutting off financing and supplies. </p><h2 id="link-251a8668">Why are they attacking ships?</h2><p>Weeks after Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, prompting Israel to unleash a devastating military campaign in Gaza, the Houthis, in solidarity with Hamas, said they would target any ship traveling to or leaving Israel and said they had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-did-they-attack-israel-2023-11-01/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched drones and missiles at Israel</a>.</p><p>But the Houthi <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/houthi-shipping-attacks-patterns-and-expectations-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criteria for attacking ships</a> quickly expanded to include vessels with direct or indirect links to Israel or past visits to Israeli ports, then also to ships with ties to the United States or Britain, and the Houthis have since broadened the category multiple times. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yahya Sarea, a Houthi spokesman, making a statement in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yahya Arhab/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Houthis have launched more than 130 attacks with drones and missiles on vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a nonprofit group that tracks the strikes. </p><p>Perhaps the most audacious Houthi operation came in November 2023, when gunmen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/19/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-houthis-hijacked-red-sea-ship.html?smid=url-share" title="">hijacked a vessel</a> named the Galaxy Leader and took it to a Yemeni port, where they have been <a href="https://www.worldcargonews.com/news/2024/11/one-year-after-hijacking-mv-galaxy-leader-still-held-in-yemen/?gdpr=accept" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holding the ship’s crew members</a> captive for more than a year.</p><p>In August, a Houthi attack on an oil tanker carrying the equivalent of about one million barrels of crude oil <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/world/middleeast/oil-tanker-red-sea-yemen-houthi-attack.html" title="">threatened to become an environmental disaster</a> as the vessel burned for weeks.

Now, many shipping companies are diverting their cargo around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip, a route that adds an extra 4,000 miles and 10 days to shipping routes and requires more fuel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A seized ship, the Galaxy Leader, off the Yemeni coast in December.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Khaled Abdullah/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>So the Houthi attacks have significantly increased the costs and risks of transporting goods, contributing to the higher prices for goods around the world, according to economists — price spikes that influenced elections in Europe and the United States.</p><p>The cost of shipping a container from Asia to northern Europe is up 270 percent in 12 months, according to Freightos, a digital marketplace for shipping.
