We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us. This type of violence is not OK. This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another. It is not OK. And it has to stop. We have to be better than this. We have a responsibility to all be better. If this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania. Here’s a third truth. If he was trying to terrorize our family, our friends, the Jewish community who joined us for a Passover Seder in that room last night, hear me on this. We celebrated our faith last night proudly. No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/13/multimedia/13NAT-SHAPIRO-02-qtwh/13NAT-SHAPIRO-02-qtwh-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The authorities in Pennsylvania arrested a suspect after a fire was set at Gov.

Josh Shapiro and his family slept, forcing them to evacuate early Sunday before the blaze severely damaged part of the building.</p><p>The man, identified as Cody Balmer, 38, jumped a fence and managed to evade state troopers after he broke into the building, the authorities said. He fled the scene and was arrested after turning himself into police on Sunday afternoon, officials said at a news conference.</p><p>Mr. Balmer was charged with attempted murder, arson and terrorism, the Dauphin County District Attorney’s Office <a href="https://dauphin.crimewatchpa.com/da/310/cases/cody-balmer-charged-connection-arson-governors-mansion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said early Monday</a>.</p><p>During a news briefing on Sunday outside the fire-scarred mansion, Governor Shapiro, a Democrat who gained national prominence last year when he was on the short list of possible running mates for Kamala Harris, said that the F.B.I. was assisting in the investigation. The smell of smoke lingered in the air as he spoke, with the blackened, broken windows where the arsonist had struck visible behind him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Shapiro became emotional as he described his family’s ordeal, recalling the moment a state trooper had banged on his door shortly after 2 a.m., waking him, his wife and his children, and rushing them to safety. The attack, he said, had been “targeted.”</p><p>“Last night, we experienced an attack, not just on our family, but on the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Mr. Shapiro said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light.”</p><p>While police did not disclose a motive, they detailed the attack in an affidavit filed with the charges against Mr. Balmer early on Monday. Mr. Balmer illegally entered the grounds of the governor’s residence early Sunday and broke a window with a hammer and threw an object inside that started a fire, according to the district attorney’s office. He then entered the building and started at least one more fire. Investigators recovered two broken glass beer bottles of Heineken that had been filled with gasoline.</p><p>When Pennsylvania state troopers interviewed Mr. Balmer later on Sunday, he admitted to starting the fires.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Pennsylvania State Police also found a jacket in Mr. Balmer’s nearby home that matched the one seen on surveillance video footage of the attack, the district attorney’s office said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/13/multimedia/13NAT-SHAPIRO-04-gmfk/13NAT-SHAPIRO-04-gmfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/13/multimedia/13NAT-SHAPIRO-04-gmfk/13NAT-SHAPIRO-04-gmfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/13/multimedia/13NAT-SHAPIRO-04-gmfk/13NAT-SHAPIRO-04-gmfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A uniformed law enforcement officer stands near a broken window.

It’s not OK.”</p><p>The State Police said <a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/psp/newsroom/state-police-investigating-fire-at-governor-s-residence.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawJosp9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHkfVwk41EgAOzHIz6A0li1NAMKggqu_D4LNetGH-8cT0FVaCJcLjiT8XSA11_aem_VHFQ43pHK2D1GNFlUPjvTg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> that the fire caused “a significant amount of damage to a portion of the residence.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Shapiro noted that the attack had occurred on the first night of Passover, one of the holiest Jewish holidays, and that other members of the local Jewish community had been celebrating in the state dining room with him and his family. “No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly or proudly,” he said.</p><p>Law enforcement officials described a chaotic scene at the mansion in the early morning hours. Once state police became aware of a security breach on the property, they set out looking for an intruder. But, in a matter of minutes, Mr. Balmer was able to break in, set the fire and escape back over the same fence he had scaled to get in, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fire damage at the mansion on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kyle Grantham for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Bryan Flores, 37, a neighbor who lives across the street from the residence, said he awoke shortly after 2 a.m. to see a large response outside from the police and firefighters. He said he “woke up to the sirens and the flashing lights” and added that the incident seemed under control at that point.</p><p>Mr. Shapiro, who served for six years as the state’s attorney general before being elected governor in 2022, has been the target of threats at least once before. In November 2023, the police arrested a man who they said sent a threatening email to him, according to a Pennsylvania State Police report. It was unclear on Sunday if the man was charged in connection with that incident.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The governor’s residence is a 29,000-square-foot Georgian-style building on the Susquehanna River that was completed in 1968, <a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/residence/the-governors-residence.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the state government</a>. Its landscaped grounds occupy a full block about a mile and a half from the State Capitol complex.</p><p>The public is able to tour the residence, which exhibits art and artifacts on the first floor.</p><p>Recent high-profile incidents of violence directed at political figures have helped fuel fear and unease among Americans, polls have shown. Before the presidential election last year, about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-poll-democracy-elections-results-violence-3016f595faea0dfc81c487e856aafb04" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four in 10</a> voters said they were extremely or very concerned about violent attempts to challenge the outcome. The assassination attempt against Mr. Trump last summer took place a little over 200 miles west of Harrisburg.</p><p>Other serious incidents have included a foiled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-militia.html" title="">plot to kidnap</a> Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan in 2020, and the home invasion and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/27/us/pelosi-attack-body-cam-video" title="">assault</a> at the home of Nancy Pelosi in 2023, which seriously injured the former House speaker’s husband, Paul.</p><p>Though American politics has grown increasingly acrimonious and deeply polarized in recent years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/us/politics/political-violence.html" title="">research shows</a> that extremist violence in the United States has actually declined, even though a handful of episodes have drawn widespread attention and alarm.
