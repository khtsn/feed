    <h1>Senate Confirms Dan Caine as Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first challenge facing him will be whether he will manage to wield any influence. Mr. Trump’s national security team has embarked on a series of early moves, including by expanding a bombing campaign meant to rein in Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and considering whether, and how, the United States will continue military assistance to Ukraine for the war with Russia.</p><p>General Caine’s confirmation came with none of the drama that accompanied that of Mr. Hegseth, who, amid a flurry of questions about his qualifications, needed Vice President JD Vance to cast the deciding vote.</p><p>Throughout General Caine’s hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 1, Democrats appeared to be torn. They wanted him to say plainly that he would push back against some of Mr. Hegseth’s initiatives targeting ethnic minorities, women and other groups. But they did not want to push so hard that they irreparably harmed his relationships with Mr. Hegseth and Mr. Trump before he even took office.</p><p>“I expect you to pledge to always provide your best military advice to the president and the secretary of defense,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the committee. “Even if that advice is not what they would want to hear.”</p><p>General Caine, for his part, promised he would give the president and Mr. Hegseth his best military advice and pledged to “speak truth to power.”</p></div></div>
