A university investigation into his death started after rumors of “unsanctioned off-campus activities” began to swell, the university, whose full name is Southern University and Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College, announced <a href="https://www.facebook.com/southernuniversitybatonrouge/posts/pfbid02GLAWYDn1A1zrB4qoBBWXuodsoxTHcHDPGN1B9Xn9v11As3Ao2FLN6dUaq3RbrnwMl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a>. The activities are believed to have been organized by the Beta Sigma chapter of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, the university said.</p><p>“We have been informed that the local authorities have launched an investigation into this tragic incident,” the fraternity said <a href="https://oppf.org/statement-on-caleb-wilson/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> on its website on Feb. 28. “We have extended ourselves to them and are ready to assist in any way possible during this difficult time.”</p><p>The coroner’s office said that “the cause and manner” of Mr. Wilson’s death were still under investigation. The Baton Rouge Police Department, which is investigating Mr. Wilson’s death, did not immediately respond on Wednesday to an email or phone call seeking additional information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“An off-campus incident is believed to have contributed to Caleb’s death,” John K. Pierre, the chancellor for the school, said on Feb. 27 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1044785437677422" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a Facebook message</a>. “Southern University is cooperating fully with the Baton Rouge Police Department.”</p><p>It is unclear whether Mr. Wilson was a fraternity member.</p><p>Mr. Wilson was a junior at Southern University, a historically Black institution, majoring in mechanical engineering. He was also a member of the “Human Jukebox” Marching Band, the school’s prestigious collegiate musical group that incorporates dance and music and has performed at Super Bowls and presidential inaugurations.</p><p>“This tragic loss leaves a void in our Jaguar family,” the school said, referring to the university’s mascot. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Caleb’s family, friends, classmates, and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.”</p><p>Southern University also said that it had begun a “student judiciary process” in the aftermath of Mr. Wilson’s death.</p><p>“Caleb was a bright and talented young man with a promising future ahead of him,” <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2025/03/01/family-breaks-silence-after-death-southern-university-student/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his family said</a> in a statement provided to WAFB, a local television station. “We are committed to seeking the truth about the circumstances surrounding Caleb’s passing and ensuring that no other family has to endure such a tragedy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A candlelight vigil honoring his life was held on campus on Friday evening.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a crackdown on fraternity hazing at schools across the country, and several states have passed legislation to address the problem.</p><p>Earlier this year, four fraternity members at San Diego State University were charged with felony counts after a pledge was set on fire during a skit at a party last year.</p><p>In October, two men who were charged in the 2017 hazing death of a Pennsylvania State University sophomore were sentenced to two to four months in prison.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
