    <h1>Trump Delayed Most New Tariffs on Canada and Mexico</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Just two days after President Trump upended North American trade by imposing 25 percent fees on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs-suspended.html" title="">he announced a temporary reversal</a>. </p><p>The president signed executive orders today offering a monthlong exemption, until April 2, for all goods covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which includes most U.S. imports from those countries. About 10 percent of Mexico’s exports to the U.S. fall outside the U.S.M.C.A. trade agreement, according to one economist.</p><p>The president announced the decision after speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. She said Trump began their call with the intention to keep tariffs in place, but changed his mind after she showed him examples of how Mexico limited the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. It’s not yet clear why he decided to pause the tariffs on Canada.</p><p>Still, the president has said that he expects to impose more tariffs on Canada and Mexico next month, when he announces what he is calling “reciprocal” tariff measures. The uncertainty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/business/stock-market-today.html?smid=url-share" title="">led to another unsteady day on Wall Street</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6025a5c9">Fearing retribution, Trump critics have muzzled themselves</h2><p>There is a chill spreading over political debate in Washington and beyond.</p><p>Fired federal workers ask journalists not to be quoted by name.

U.S. negotiators met with their Russian counterparts last month.</p><p>European leaders met today in Brussels to discuss a $160 billion plan to bolster their defenses and proposals to send troops to Ukraine to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/europe/europe-trump-ukraine-defense.html" title="">support a future peace plan</a>. </p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said he was willing to discuss <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/europe/france-nuclear-europe.html" title="">extending the protection afforded by his country’s nuclear arsenal</a> to its European allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An image taken during Athena’s descent to the lunar surface.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA TV</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-4e457d59">A moon lander’s fate is uncertain</h2><p>Athena, a 15-foot-tall robotic spacecraft,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/06/science/moon-landing#what-you-need-to-know-about-the-athena-moon-landing" title=""> tried this afternoon to land on the moon</a>.

Or, as one scientist put it: “You wake up in the morning and you suddenly feel old.”</p><p>There may be a scientific basis for this experience. By analyzing age-related markers, researchers are coming to understand that aging in adulthood is not a linear process, but perhaps one that jumps dramatically at certain points. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/well/nonlinear-aging.html" title="">Here’s what that could mean for your health and life span</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Malosh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><h2 id="link-30274f2">Ready for a few comma jokes?</h2><p>What do you get when hundreds of grammar aficionados gather to watch a film in New York?
