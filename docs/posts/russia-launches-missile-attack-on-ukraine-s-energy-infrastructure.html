He once again urged Ukraine’s partners to respond, saying, “The world can stop this madness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The International Atomic Energy Agency had made a renewed call on Thursday for Russia to stop targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure: The agency’s board of governors signed a resolution addressing the threats that the attacks pose to nuclear safety.</p><p>“The international community must increase pressure on Russia for its deliberate attempts to create a radiation disaster on the continent,” the resolution said.</p><p>The agency <a href="https://x.com/iaeaorg/status/1867500773627863315" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said after Friday’s attack</a> that five of Ukraine’s nine operating nuclear reactors had to reduce their power output because of Russia’s “renewed attacks on energy infrastructure.”</p><p>The first reports of damage after the assault came from western Ukraine. The Lviv and Ternopil regions reported power outages, and Svitlana Onyshchuk, the head of the Ivano-Frankivsk military administration, said on social media that her region had experienced “the most massive attack since the start of the full-scale war.”</p><p>Russia launches exploding drones at Ukraine nightly. The larger waves, which combine various types of missiles along with the drones, have come every few weeks and are typically aimed at electrical infrastructure such as power plants, in a long-running campaign to black out the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Military analysts had speculated this week that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/putin-syria-ukraine.html" title="">President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could try to escalate these attacks</a> as a show of force after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Russia’s ally.</p><p>Some analysts have said, however, that Russia is at the limits of its capacity for launching missiles, having depleted its stockpiles and firing as many missiles as its industry can produce.</p><p>On Wednesday, Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3998124/deputy-pentagon-press-secretary-sabrina-singh-holds-a-press-briefing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it was possible</a> that Russia could fire another of a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, in the coming days.
