    <h1>Overnight ‘Vote-a-Rama’ in the Senate Frames a Contentious Budget Debate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“This is going to be a long, drawn-out fight,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said as members of his party lined up to offer amendments to fight Mr. Trump’s fiscal agenda. “Democrats are going to hold the floor all day long and all night long to expose how Republicans want to cut taxes for billionaires while gutting things Americans care about most.”</p><p>Passing a budget resolution is a key step toward enacting Mr. Trump’s fiscal agenda, a process that has been complicated by competing strategies among House and Senate Republicans about the best way to accomplish the president’s priorities.</p><p>“People are counting on us,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Budget Committee, declared on the floor moments before the rally of votes began. “They’re counting on this Republican majority to give the president the money he needs to do the job that he promised to do, and we’re going to deliver.”</p><p>“If it’s 5 o’clock in the morning — I don’t care how long it takes,” Mr. Graham added. By late Thursday evening, that seemed very possible.</p><p>For Democrats, who do not have enough votes to block Republicans’ budget, the vote-a-rama was a way to slow its roll, challenge G.O.P. priorities and, when possible, force Republicans into uncomfortable votes intended to create a damaging record to attack them on during next year’s midterm elections. The rules of the Senate allow members to propose an unlimited number of budget amendments, meaning voting can continue until Democrats lose steam and allow the debate to come to a close.</p></div></div>
