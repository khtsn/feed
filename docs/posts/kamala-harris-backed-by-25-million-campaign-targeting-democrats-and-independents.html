    <h1>Kamala Harris Backed by $25 Million Campaign Targeting Democrats and Independents</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amplify, a coalition of progressive groups, released <a href="https://f.io/6jFOTwOR" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its first digital ad</a> supporting Vice President Kamala Harris’s bid for the White House, part of a $25 million voter outreach campaign targeting Democrats and disaffected independents in battleground states.</p><p>The ad reflects <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/us/politics/midterms-democrats-freedom.html" title="">a unified message from the left</a> that the organizations began testing in the 2022 midterms, and which they say helped blunt what had been expected to be a sweeping victory for Republicans. The 30-second spot casts the November election as a choice between two futures: one in which Americans control their own lives and another in which their freedoms are curtailed by Donald J. Trump and his allies.</p><p>The members of the coalition said they plan to spend $1 million on the ad’s release.</p><p>The Amplify campaign began this year in coordination with Way to Win, a national hub of left-leaning Democratic donors and political strategists, the ad agency Gutsy Media and more than 200 grass-roots groups, many based in the crucial states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The organizations created a digital tool kit and online library of ads, documentary-style first-person stories and stock footage that Democratic organizations, activists and influencers are using to create and disseminate content online and on television.</p><p>The digital components center on the campaign’s overarching theme: “Our Freedoms, Our Families, Our Futures.” Democrats at every level of the party, including President Biden, began testing that pitch in 2022, staking a claim to language about freedom and personal liberty often used by Republicans. The theme has been widely used by Democrats since the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/roe-v-wade-supreme-court-abortion" title="">overturned Roe v. Wade</a> that year. Ms. Harris, who has long made discussion of abortion rights a major part of her stump speeches, has also fashioned the freedom theme into a core part of her campaign’s message.</p></div></div>
