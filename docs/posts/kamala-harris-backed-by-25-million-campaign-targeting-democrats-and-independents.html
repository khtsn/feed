The 30-second spot casts the November election as a choice between two futures: one in which Americans control their own lives and another in which their freedoms are curtailed by Donald J. Trump and his allies.</p><p>The members of the coalition said they plan to spend $1 million on the ad’s release.</p><p>The Amplify campaign began this year in coordination with Way to Win, a national hub of left-leaning Democratic donors and political strategists, the ad agency Gutsy Media and more than 200 grass-roots groups, many based in the crucial states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The organizations created a digital tool kit and online library of ads, documentary-style first-person stories and stock footage that Democratic organizations, activists and influencers are using to create and disseminate content online and on television.</p><p>The digital components center on the campaign’s overarching theme: “Our Freedoms, Our Families, Our Futures.” Democrats at every level of the party, including President Biden, began testing that pitch in 2022, staking a claim to language about freedom and personal liberty often used by Republicans. The theme has been widely used by Democrats since the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/roe-v-wade-supreme-court-abortion" title="">overturned Roe v. Wade</a> that year. Ms. Harris, who has long made discussion of abortion rights a major part of her stump speeches, has also fashioned the freedom theme into a core part of her campaign’s message.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Grecia Lima, the national political director of Community Change Action, which works to build political power among low-income people and is a national partner of Amplify, said her group has used the initiative’s scripts in phone banks and door-knocking outreach, and in a program that pays more than 100 influencers to produce content <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8UkI8OOXja/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Instagram</a> and TikTok.</p><p>“We went out and recruited, specifically, young people of color whose audience is not primarily political,” she said. Some of the videos feature online messengers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9hsM-1OdJS/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speaking directly to their audiences</a>, while others weave the campaign’s values into tutorials on topics ranging from rapping to makeup.</p><p>When Amplify started up this year, the presidential race was set to be a rematch between two older men who didn’t excite some Democrats and independents. Progressive groups initially focused more on empowering voters who had become so disengaged they planned to vote for third-party candidates or not vote at all.</p><p>Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, a co-founder and vice president of Way to Win, said that their options have expanded since Ms. Harris emerged as the Democratic nominee.</p><p>“There was a lot of malaise we had to kind of try to cut through,” she said. “We’re just in a totally different moment.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Aug. 13, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the year the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
