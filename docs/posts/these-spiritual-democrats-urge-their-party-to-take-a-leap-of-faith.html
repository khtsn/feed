Trump grapples with what it stands for now, these officials see discussion of faith as a way to introduce themselves, explain their values and find common ground.</p><p>Many are also battling the idea that religion has a political party, echoing other Democratic challenges to Republican claims on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/harris-walz-democrats-language.html" title="">patriotism</a> and <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/campaigns/article220065860.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">support for the troops</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It’s unfortunate that in American politics, faith rhetoric has become one more tool in the politics of ‘us and them,’” said Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, who leads the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, saying that the major faith traditions emphasize seeing others as “neighbors.”</p><p>“I’m trying to reclaim that, in the noisy conversation that we in the American family have about who we are,” he added.</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris visited churches during the campaign and occasionally mentioned her pastor — but she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/kamala-harris-religious-church.html" title="">rarely discussed her Christian faith</a> in personal terms.</p><p>Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Ariz., who was involved in Republicans for Harris efforts, saw that as a missed opportunity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“I don’t know if it was because we didn’t have enough time, or because the people that were doing messaging for the campaign for some reason didn’t think that was an important message,” he said. “In hindsight, I think it would have helped.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Ariz., right, saw Vice President Kamala Harris’s infrequent discussions of her faith in personal terms as a missed opportunity.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>State Representative James Talarico of Texas, a Democrat who is studying to become a minister, was more blunt, describing “a hesitancy, even among deeply religious Democrats,” to discuss the subject.</p><p>“Progressives have got to understand that the separation of church and state is not the separation of faith and politics,” said Mr. Talarico, who is weighing a statewide run. “Unless we do, we’re going to keep losing elections.”</p><h2 id="link-1205bd72">‘Being open about your faith actually allows you to get closer to people’</h2><p>In October, Mr. Warnock hosted Mr. Shapiro at his church.

Voters who were not Jewish, he said, would mention it to him.</p><p>“People would come over to me and say, ‘Hey, I saw your ad.

liberal values while identifying herself as a “straight, white, Christian, married suburban mom,” said many Americans, including herself, had complex relationships with religion.</p><p>That, too, can present opportunities for connection, she said — especially when, fairly or not, “people perceive Donald Trump as authentic.”</p><p>“If it is part of your experience in an authentic way, no matter how messy or complicated it is, talk about it, because there are countless people who have that same experience who want to feel seen,” said Ms. McMorrow, who is considering options for a 2026 statewide
