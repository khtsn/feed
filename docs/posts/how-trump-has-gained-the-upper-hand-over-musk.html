Musk’s X feed in recent days has focused more on excoriating immigration protesters in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Trump warned Musk to keep quiet, however.</strong> The president told NBC News that there would be “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-elon-musk-consequences-funds-democratic-candidates-rcna211605" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serious consequences</a>” if his erstwhile ally backed Democratic challengers to Republican lawmakers over the policy bill.</p><p>When Trump was asked if he would get on the phone with Musk anytime soon, the president said, “I have no intention of speaking to him.”</p><p><strong>Trump has a lot of leverage over Musk.</strong> While the Tesla chief <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/politics/trump-musk-policy-bill.html" title="">donated about $275 million</a> to help Trump win re-election in November, in some ways the president has the upper hand:</p><ul><li><p>Musk’s companies were promised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" title="">$3 billion in federal contracts</a> from 17 federal agencies in 2023 alone. Trump following through on threats to cut those contracts would hurt significantly: “Elon, Tesla, and investors are beginning to understand more and more just how much the government has control here,” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cathie-wood-musk-trump-ark-invest-2025-6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cathie Wood</a>, a prominent Tesla shareholder, said recently.</p></li><li><p>There’s also the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/trump-musk-spacex-contracts.html" title="">risk of a regulatory crackdown</a> by Trump. At least 11 agencies were investigating or suing Musk companies before Trump took office, The Times notes. Policy moves like looser regulation of autonomous vehicles — which is key to Musk’s plans for Tesla — could be rescinded. Musk could also lose his security clearance, hurting SpaceX.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Musk rivals see an opportunity.</strong> The Red Letter’s Tara Palmieri reports that <a href="https://www.tarapalmeri.com/p/exclusive-bill-gates-runs-to-white" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bill Gates</a>, who has repeatedly clashed with his fellow tech mogul, visited the White House on Friday to argue for undoing some of the Musk-driven cuts to foreign aid.</p><p>And NASA and the Pentagon urged competitors to SpaceX to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/06/07/trump-musk-spacex-nasa-national-security/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speed up development of alternative rocket systems</a>, after Musk briefly threatened to decommission the Dragon spacecraft that the U.S. uses for space missions, The Washington Post reports. That could benefit Boeing and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Readers weigh in:</strong> Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/business/dealbook/musk-trump-fight.html" title="">Andrew asked</a> if Musk’s public pushback against Trump would inspire other corporate leaders to speak out. An email from Judy Samuelson, the executive director of the Aspen Institute Business and Society Program, summed up many readers’ feelings:</p><blockquote><p>My gut? No, it does NOT catalyze “normal” CEOs, with more traditional relationships and responsibilities. That will only be enabled by collective action, which means business associations and networks and singular leaders able to catalyze others, like Ken Frazier and Ken Chenault did in the wake of George Floyd. One could ask, where and who are those leaders?</p></blockquote><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>Inflation, consumer sentiment and Apple’s A.I. efforts will be in focus this week.</strong> Apple’s annual developers conference is set to kick off today with questions about the iPhone maker’s ability to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/785aeb00-6784-4d64-a706-0cb44288e6be" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">catch up in the artificial intelligence race</a>.

The inflation effect on consumer confidence will be closely scrutinized in the release of the latest University of Michigan household survey, set for Friday.</p><p><strong>Meta is said to be weighing its biggest ever A.I. investment.</strong> The company is in talks to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-08/meta-in-talks-for-scale-ai-investment-that-could-top-10-billion?srnd=phx-deals&amp;sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invest more than $10 billion in Scale AI</a>, the data-labeling specialist that works for many A.I. giants, according to Bloomberg.

This morning, Beijing reported <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/707c4613-30de-4698-97d2-672aa13142b2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a steep drop</a> in exports to the United States last month as Trump’s tariffs begin to snarl supply chains.</p><p>And economists are warning that tariffs could raise inflation and dampen household and business spending in the United States in the second half of the year.</p><p><strong>Who will be in the room? </strong>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, will meet a Chinese delegation led by He Lifeng, Beijing’s top trade negotiator. Bessent, Greer and He met in Geneva last month, reaching a 90-day truce that centered on a lowering of tariffs. But tensions remain, as each country <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/02/china-says-the-us-undermined-geneva-trade-deal-after-trump-accusations.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accuses the other</a> of violating the terms of that agreement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Potentially complicating the U.S. position, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/us/politics/trump-tariffs-appeals-court.html" title="">faces a deadline today</a> to defend the legality of many of its stiffest tariffs before a federal appeals court.</p><p><strong>The sticking points:</strong> China has been especially angered by Washington’s limits on chip exports, measures that are overseen by Lutnick. For the U.S., a major complaint is China’s curb on the flows of critical minerals, which are needed by automakers and military contractors.</p><p><strong>Could China loosen its stance on rare earth magnet exports?</strong> Beijing this weekend said it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-may-speed-up-rare-earths-application-approvals-eu-2025-06-07/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could fast-track</a> applications for rare earth shipments to European Union companies after wrapping up talks with E.U. trade officials.</p><p>Can the U.S. team win a similar arrangement — and what concessions would they need to offer?</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Henry Kravis and Dick Beattie in Tuscany, Italy, in 1986.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Slim Aarons/Hulton Archive, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-7dbce697">Remembering Dick Beattie, legendary M.&amp;A. lawyer</h2><p>For six decades, when the biggest corporate deal makers needed legal advice on mergers and acquisitions, many of them turned to one name: Dick Beattie.</p><p>Beattie, a former Marine pilot and longtime leader of the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett — whose role in KKR’s takeover of RJR Nabisco <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/business/what-s-an-aging-barbarian-to-do.html" title="">was immortalized</a> in “Barbarians at the Gate” — died on Friday of cancer, Michael de la Merced writes.

He first met Beattie in 1969, and came to rely on the young lawyer for much of his deal-making.
