He did not outline the changes, but suggested they were related to further cuts to Medicaid and eliminating clean energy tax credits created during the Biden administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I think this package is en route to get passed,” Mr. Harris said. But he added: “I don’t think it can be done today.”</p><p>Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas and a holdout on the bill, said that the negotiations had yielded “significant progress,” but there was still “a long way to go.”</p><p>Should the bill advance from the committee to the House floor, it could receive a vote as early as Wednesday. But as the panel’s work stretched on, it was not clear when Republicans would even reveal the changes they had made to the legislation, much less be able to call it up.</p><p>“We’re meeting in the dead of night to consider a terrible bill, and you haven’t even drafted or shared some of the most critical parts of the bill,” Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said at 2:40 a.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The House Rules Committee met on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the early hours on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Reflecting the unwieldy negotiations, Mr. Harris’s comments on Wednesday morning were a turnaround from remarks he had made just hours earlier.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In an interview with Newsmax, Mr. Harris suggested that conservatives were unhappy with concessions Republican leaders had made to a group of blue-state Republicans to increase the limit on the state and local tax deduction, now set at $10,000. Those lawmakers, late Tuesday night, had been closing on a deal to raise the cap to $40,000, an increase from the $30,000 level included in the bill, according to three people familiar with the talks.</p><p>The debate was unfolding the day after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-big-beautiful-bill.html?smid=url-share" title="">Mr. Trump visited Capitol Hill to pressure Republicans</a> to unify around the wide-ranging package, which would slash taxes, steer more money to the military and border security, and pay for some of it with cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, education and clean energy programs. Mr. Johnson, his deputies and White House officials spent days haggling with rank-and-file Republicans who wanted changes to the bill.</p><p>If Republicans are able to strike a deal on a set of concessions, the House could be on track within hours to pass <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/house-gop-tax-bill-trump.html" title="">the sprawling legislation</a> — the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — which would largely keep current tax rates in place, while temporarily implementing new cuts like Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to not federally tax tips or overtime. </p><p>“We are delivering on the promise we made to the voters: on no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on seniors,” Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said. “These are real impacts for real Americans.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The bill, which is expected to face changes in the Senate, is a reflection of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/republican-tax-bill-factions.html" title="">competing Republican factions with disparate priorities</a>. A group of fiscal conservatives have demanded structural changes and cuts to Medicaid and other programs to hold down the overall cost of the bill and rein in deficits, while more moderate and politically vulnerable lawmakers have sought to protect Medicaid, demanded larger tax breaks for their constituents and fought to preserve clean energy tax credits.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Johnson can afford to lose only three Republican votes on the spending package if all Democrats uniformly oppose it.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The legislation is projected to cause around 10 million Americans to become insured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Republican leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">opted against more aggressive options they had considered to cut Medicaid</a>, bowing to more moderate Republicans, mostly from politically competitive districts, who warned they could not accept such reductions. Mr. Trump has also opposed such cuts.</p><p>Even with the spending cuts demanded by the fiscal hawks, the legislation was still expected to add trillions to the national debt, which is already at a level that many economists and Wall Street investors find alarming. In a preliminary analysis of an earlier version of the bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would add roughly $2.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.</p><p>In a separate analysis requested by Democrats, the budget office also found that the legislation would leave the poorest Americans worse off while providing a lift to the richest. In 2027, the bottom 10 percent would lose the equivalent of 2 percent of their income largely because of the reduced benefits, while the tax cuts would provide the top 10 percent with a 4 percent increase to their income, the budget office estimated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Facing a tight margin in the House, Mr. Johnson can afford to lose only three Republican votes on the spending package if all Democrats uniformly oppose it, as expected, and every member votes. The speaker has insisted his conference must pass the bill before Memorial Day.</p><p>That self-imposed deadline that has created significant — if artificial — pressure, leading to fevered, down-to-the wire negotiations and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/house-representatitves-asleep.html" title="">an occasionally nocturnal legislative schedule</a>.</p><p>The early-morning meeting of the Rules Committee, a panel that controls whether and how legislation can be debated and what modifications can be made to a bill before it comes to a final vote, was meant to clear the way for a vote later Wednesday or Thursday.</p><p>Democrats criticized Republicans for the scheduling, accusing them of trying to hide parts of their signature legislation from the public and push through changes while most Americans were sleeping.</p><p>“If Republicans are so proud about what is in this bill,” Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the committee, said in the predawn hours of Wednesday morning’s session, “then why are you trying to ram it through in the dead of the night?”</p><p>Maya C.
