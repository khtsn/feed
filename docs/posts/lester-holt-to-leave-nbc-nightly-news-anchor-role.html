The evening newscast was mired in a scandal after it was revealed that Brian Williams, the anchor at the time, had embellished a story about a helicopter attack in Iraq.</p><p>Mr. Holt, then the weekend anchor of the “NBC Nightly News,” filled in for Mr. Williams for several months, and then was given the job full time after it was decided that Mr. Williams would move over to MSNBC after a suspension.</p><p>In a note to staff, Janelle Rodriguez, the executive vice president of programming at NBC News, applauded Mr. Holt’s tenure, and for leading the newscast “during some of the country’s most fraught and challenging times in the past decade.”</p><p>“Quite simply, Lester is the beating heart of this news organization,” she wrote.</p><p>Mr. Holt’s departure comes at a time of change for many news divisions. A slew of veteran anchors — Hoda Kotb, Chris Wallace, Chuck Todd — have left their jobs in recent months.</p><p>The “CBS Evening News” recently transitioned to a new format, turning to two anchors and a slew of correspondents to lead its 6:30 program in lieu of a single person reading off the news.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
