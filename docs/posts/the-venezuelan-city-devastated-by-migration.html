    <h1>The Venezuelan City Devastated By Migration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>It was once a thriving metropolis in the heart of oil country in Venezuela.</p><p>That city, Maracaibo, no longer exists.</p><p>Today, the city is rife with abandoned houses, some of which look like bombs were dropped on them, because homeowners tore windows and roofs off to sell for scrap before they took off on journeys to Colombia, Chile and the United States. Middle-class neighborhoods are filled with for sale signs and overgrown yards.</p><p>Fewer cars drive down the streets, and fewer criminals are around to steal them. Christmas dinners, once packed with noisy relatives, are lonely affairs aided by webcams.</p><p>Nearly eight million people — more than a quarter of the population — have fled Venezuela in recent years, driven out by economic misery and political repression.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-2"><div><figcaption><span>Abandoned and empty homes in Maracaibo, which has been hollowed out by a mass exodus of residents leaving the country for better economic opportunites.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Nowhere is that exodus more staggeringly acute than in Maracaibo, which has been hollowed out by the loss of about half a million of its 2.2 million inhabitants — many of them adults in their late teens to middle age. (The population figure is based on surveys, since the government has not conducted an official census in more than a decade.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The first blow you sense is the loneliness,” said Maracaibo’s mayor, Rafael Ramírez. “It’s devastating, and affects you emotionally.”</p><p>Maracaibo, which is in western Venezuela and remains the country’s second-largest city, has been battered by a collapsed economy, routine blackouts and persistent gasoline and water shortages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Many working adults searching for jobs elsewhere have left their children home until they can establish a firmer footing, leaving aging grandparents to fill the breach.</p><p>“Right now, this is a country of old people,’’ said Antonio Sierra, 72, as he sat in his living room lounge chair and looked up at a window where outside many of the houses on his block are empty.</p><p>All three of Mr. Sierra’s adult children are gone. One of his sons left behind a baby, Rafael, who is now 7. Last year, even the boy’s teachers left. Mr. Sierra and some other grandparents took up a collection to pay a replacement $2 a week to teach first grade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A man holds a young boy while seated on a couch." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb/01venezuela-migration-sierra-cpkb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Antonio Sierra, 72, with his grandson, Rafael, at their home in Maracaibo.

It followed the collapse of the state oil company, which was caused by corruption, a lack of investment and political purges of skilled employees — and exacerbated by U.S. sanctions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>An enormous nationwide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/americas/venezuela-blackout-maracaibo.html" title="">power outage in 2019</a> triggered days of looting in Maracaibo and tipped the scales. The State of Zulia, which includes Maracaibo, borders Colombia, making leaving on foot easier for people who could not afford airfare. (The power went out again on Friday, when a major <a href="https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-power-outage-b8f412456bdbba9c9e2fb17039ba4cc9?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blackout</a> cut electricity nationwide.)</p><p>A recent survey commissioned by the Chamber of Commerce in Zulia showed that nearly 70 percent of the families interviewed had an immediate family member outside the country.</p><p>At least half of the people questioned for another survey commissioned by Maracaibo’s mayor said they were considering leaving, a number considerably higher than the overall national rate of 30 percent of survey respondents who expressed a desire to go, said Efraín Rincón, a political consultant who conducted <a href="https://ccm.org.ve/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PLAN-DATA-MARACAIBO.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the surveys.</a></p><p>“Faced with this reality, we see that the portion of the elderly is growing, but not organically — not because there are more older people,” Mr. Rincón said. “It’s because there are fewer young people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A residential building in Maracaibo where most of the apartments are empty because most of the tenants have left Venezuela.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Much was riding on the election on July 28, when Mr. Maduro faced off against Edmundo González, a retired diplomat who took the place of a more popular opposition candidate barred by the government from running.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-election-results.html" title="">Polling machine tallies collected by electoral observers showed that Mr. González</a> won easily. The government says otherwise, but more than a month after the race, officials have yet to provide precinct-level election results.</p><p>Many people, even longtime supporters of Mr. Maduro’s mentor, former President Hugo Chávez, had counted on an opposition triumph to start reversing the country’s fortunes and lure their loved ones back home.</p><p>María Corina Machado, the opposition leader who was prevented from running, made that a cornerstone of Mr. González’s campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Instead, the government quickly cracked down on demonstrations in the days after the election — arresting around 2,000 protesters, activists, journalists and politicians.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Once a city of 2.2 million, Maracaibo’s population has dwindled by half a million in recent years.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>With the Maduro government showing no inclination to negotiate a solution to the electoral crisis, migration levels later this year are “going to be dramatic,” said Mirla Pérez, a professor and social science researcher at the University of Central Venezuela. “Right now, people are strategizing how to leave.”</p><p>Ms. Pérez said migrants typically first leave their children behind and then send for them later, once they are financially situated. Eventually, they send for their parents, too.</p><p>A recent trip to the airport in Maracaibo found a number of people, including several older adults, leaving for good to join their adult children in Spain and Argentina. Taxi drivers who frequently make the three-hour trip to the Colombian border reported long lines of Venezuelans leaving on foot.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Back in Maracaibo, hundreds of thousands of older people are in precarious conditions, according to a nonprofit, Convite, earning around $3 a month in retirement benefits. Though most people receive some money from relatives abroad, Mr. Rincón’s surveys showed that the average amount was less than $25 a month.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A street in Maracaibo where many homes have been abandoned. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The Maduro administration, in an apparent acknowledgment of the problem, created a Ministry for Older Adults to guarantee access to health care, food and public services.</p><p>Mr. Sierra’s wife, Marlenis Miranda, 68, said she managed the household around the schedule of when power and water were available.</p><p>Electricity comes on maybe once a week, sometimes every other week. When the water turns on every week or so, she fills four huge barrels to use the rest of the week, and reuses bath water to flush the toilets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Their son, a former police officer, is driving for Uber in Texas, while their daughter is working at a nursery school in Vermont.
