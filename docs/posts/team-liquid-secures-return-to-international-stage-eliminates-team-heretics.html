		<p>Team Liquid has eliminated Team Heretics in the EMEA Kickoff lower final after a quick 3-0 win. The victory marks Liquid&#39;s return to an EMEA grand final for the first time since 2023, as well as sending them to their first international event since Champions: Los Angeles. Team Heretics is now out of Kickoff contention, earning only one Championship point for Paris qualification. </p>

<p>Team Liquid&#39;s dominant performance began on Lotus, debuting a new comp to take their opponent&#39;s map 13-4. Abyss also went Liquid&#39;s way, with the eventual winners taking the map 13-4 after a five-round streak on attack. The final map, Fracture, ended 13-7, with Liquid&#39;s dominant scoreline proving too difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>The final team to secure a Masters: Bangkok ticket, Team Liquid will next play against Team Vitality in the Kickoff EMEA grand final. The winner will earn an additional Championship point, which will aid in securing one of two Champions: Paris slots granted to EMEA via the points leaderboard. </p>
