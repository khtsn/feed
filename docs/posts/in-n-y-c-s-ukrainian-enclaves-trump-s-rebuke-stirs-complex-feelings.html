But Mr. Moshchinsky, who voted for Mr. Trump, said “I don’t disagree with the content” of Mr. Trump’s criticisms of Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>The local city councilwoman, Inna Vernikov, a Republican and a Trump supporter, tried to thread a needle, writing on <a href="https://x.com/innavernikov/status/1895599188194300059?s=46&amp;t=NaVZKiZ6BRNnMCrMNrheGA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> that the consequences of Friday’s meeting “could be disastrous” for both countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Working together to end this war and help the people of Ukraine restore their safety and sovereignty is in the best interests of both of our countries and the world,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inna Kir, a Ukrainian immigrant who owns a lingerie shop, applauded President Trump’s attack on President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Inna Kir, 58, who owns a lingerie shop on Brighton Beach Avenue, said she “absolutely agrees” with the tough line Mr. Trump has taken against Mr. Zelensky.

Mr. Makar, who lives in Westchester County north of the city, said his family had fled Ukraine seeking security. The meeting on Friday left him furious and devastated, he said.</p><p>“It was typical bully behavior, and Zelensky stood up to the bullies,” Mr. Makar said. “As a Ukrainian, I’m proud. As an American, I’m disgusted.”</p><p>Jason Birchard, 58, the owner of the Ukrainian restaurant Veselka in the East Village, stood inside the restaurant on Saturday wearing a T-shirt embossed with the tryzub, Ukraine’s national symbol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I’ve worn this shirt many times over the last three years, and I made sure to dig deep into the closet today and pull it out because I really want to back Zelensky,” Mr. Birchard said, as a line streamed around the block.</p><p>Mr. Birchard said the restaurant had seen a surge in customers amid the news.</p><p>“I’m a Ukrainian American, and I try to stay positive and optimistic,” he said. “There is the false narrative that Ukraine invaded Russia. We have to understand that Ukraine has been an independent democratic state for more than 30 years, and that we need to draw the line here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ilia Makarov, a computing student from Ukraine, said he was distressed that many of his neighbors in Brighton Beach support President Trump’s hard line against Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In Brooklyn, on a sunny corner off Brighton Beach Avenue, Ilia Makarov, 20, vented similar frustrations as the Q train clattered overhead.</p><p>Mr. Makarov, a computer science student who came to Brighton Beach from Ukraine five years ago, said he found it “unimaginable” that the United States might now back Russia in the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Usually when you think about the U.S. it is as peacemakers,” Mr. Makarov said. “Now they support literally the terrorists.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brighton Beach and adjacent neighborhoods are home to about 15,000 Ukrainians and 7,000 Russians.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maia Coleman writes about breaking news and the criminal justice system in New York City and its surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maia-coleman">More about Maia Coleman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
