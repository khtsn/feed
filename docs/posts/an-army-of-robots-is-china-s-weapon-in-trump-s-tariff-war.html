More robot carts, and the occasional human driving a forklift, take the components to a warehouse.</p><p>Yet more robots take the panels to the assembly line, where hundreds of robotic arms, working in teams of up to 16, do a complex dance to weld them together into car bodies.

Even with the automation, they are needed to check quality and install some parts that require manual dexterity, like wiring harnesses. There are things cameras and computers cannot do on their own.

Most of the world’s car assembly plants built in the past 20 years were in China, and an automation industry grew up around them.</p><p>Chinese companies also bought overseas suppliers of advanced robotics, like Kuka of Germany, and moved much of their operations to China. When Volkswagen opened an electric car factory a year ago in Hefei, it had only one robot from Germany and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/business/volkswagen-china.html" title="">1,074 robots</a> made in Shanghai.</p><p>China’s rapid advance in factory robotics has been propelled from the top down. Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” initiative, which began a decade ago, set out 10 industries in which China sought to be globally competitive. Robotics was one of them.</p><p>To force the car industry to think about how to use humanoid robots with two arms and two legs, for example, government officials in Beijing told major automakers last year to rent robots and submit videos of them performing tasks in their assembly plants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The videos required many takes to get them right. The robots did only basic tasks, like sorting auto parts in a warehouse. But the initiative has helped push the carmakers along.</p><p>In a show of the automation push, the Beijing municipal government held a half-marathon on Saturday for 12,000 runners and 20 humanoid robots. Only six robots finished the race, and the fastest of them took nearly three times as long as the fastest runners.
