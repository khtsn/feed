With engineers and electricians tending to fleets of robots, these operations are bringing down the cost of manufacturing while improving quality.</p><p>As a result, China’s factories will be able to keep the price of many of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/business/china-trade-surplus-trump.html" title="">exports</a> lower, giving it an advantage in fighting the trade war and President Trump’s high tariffs. China is also facing new trade barriers by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/european-union-china-electric-vehicle-tariffs.html" title="">European Union</a> and developing countries ranging from Brazil and India to Turkey and Thailand.</p><p>Factories are now more automated in China than in the United States, Germany or Japan. China has more factory robots for every 10,000 manufacturing workers than any other country except South Korea or Singapore, according to the International Federation of Robotics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>China’s automation drive has been guided by government directives and backed with huge investment.

He is now preparing to pay $40,000 to a Chinese company for a robotic arm with a camera. The device uses artificial intelligence to observe how a worker welds the sides of an oven, and then duplicates the action with minimal human intervention.</p><p>Only four years ago, the same system was available only from foreign robot companies and cost nearly $140,000. “Before, I never would have imagined investing in automation,” Mr. Li said, adding that a human employee “can only work for eight hours a day, but a machine can work 24 hours.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A worker making ovens and cookware at a small factory in Guangzhou.

More robot carts, and the occasional human driving a forklift, take the components to a warehouse.</p><p>Yet more robots take the panels to the assembly line, where hundreds of robotic arms, working in teams of up to 16, do a complex dance to weld them together into car bodies. The welding area is a so-called dark factory, meaning that the robots can operate without workers and with the lights off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-12"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/22/multimedia/BIZ-CHINA-AUTOMATION-video-forklift-cover-kcfp/BIZ-CHINA-AUTOMATION-video-forklift-cover-kcfp-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/22/multimedia/BIZ-CHINA-AUTOMATION-video-forklift-cover-kcfp/BIZ-CHINA-AUTOMATION-video-forklift-cover-kcfp-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/21/138106_1_BIZ-CHINA-AUTOMATION-video-forklift_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">After a worker leaves, a robotic cart delivers door parts at the Zeekr auto assembly plant.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>China’s factories still employ legions of workers. Even with the automation, they are needed to check quality and install some parts that require manual dexterity, like wiring harnesses. There are things cameras and computers cannot do on their own. Before cars are painted, workers still run gloved hands over them and sand smooth any tiny imperfections.</p><p>Yet some of the later steps of quality control are also being automated with the help of artificial intelligence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Near the end of Zeekr’s assembly line, a dozen high-resolution cameras take photos of each car. Computers compare the images to an extensive database of correctly assembled cars and alert factory staff if a discrepancy is found. The task takes seconds to complete.</p><p>“Most of our colleagues’ jobs involve sitting in front of a computer monitor,” said Pinky Wu, a Zeekr worker.</p><p>Zeekr and other Chinese automakers are also using artificial intelligence to design cars and their features more efficiently.</p><p>Carrie Li, a designer who works at Zeekr’s new office building in Shanghai, uses A.I. to analyze how different interior surfaces will intersect in a car.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“I have more spare time to open my mind and explore for myself which kinds of fashion trends to include in the cars’ interior,” Ms. Li said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A white-glove inspection of a vehicle on the assembly line.

Most of the world’s car assembly plants built in the past 20 years were in China, and an automation industry grew up around them.</p><p>Chinese companies also bought overseas suppliers of advanced robotics, like Kuka of Germany, and moved much of their operations to China. When Volkswagen opened an electric car factory a year ago in Hefei, it had only one robot from Germany and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/business/volkswagen-china.html" title="">1,074 robots</a> made in Shanghai.</p><p>China’s rapid advance in factory robotics has been propelled from the top down. Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” initiative, which began a decade ago, set out 10 industries in which China sought to be globally competitive. Robotics was one of them.</p><p>To force the car industry to think about how to use humanoid robots with two arms and two legs, for example, government officials in Beijing told major automakers last year to rent robots and submit videos of them performing tasks in their assembly plants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The videos required many takes to get them right. The robots did only basic tasks, like sorting auto parts in a warehouse. But the initiative has helped push the carmakers along.</p><p>In a show of the automation push, the Beijing municipal government held a half-marathon on Saturday for 12,000 runners and 20 humanoid robots. Only six robots finished the race, and the fastest of them took nearly three times as long as the fastest runners. But the event helped draw attention to robots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>To demonstrate advances in automation, Beijing held a half-marathon for 12,000 runners and 20 humanoid robots.

The country’s top economic planning agency announced a $137 billion national venture capital fund for robotics, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>China’s government-controlled banks have increased lending to industrial borrowers over the past four years by a staggering $1.9 trillion. That has paid for the construction of factories as well as the replacement of equipment at existing ones.</p><p>China’s universities produce about 350,000 mechanical engineering graduates per year, as well as electricians, welders and other trained technicians.</p><p>By comparison, American universities graduate about 45,000 mechanical engineers each year.</p><p>Jonathan Hurst, the chief robot officer and a co-founder of Agility Robotics, a leading American robot manufacturer, said finding skilled employees had been one of his biggest challenges.

He said that his high school education might not be enough for him to qualify for classes in programming robots, and that he worried he might lose his job someday to a robot.</p><p>“It is not just my concern — everyone worries about it,” Mr. Geng said.</p><p>Automation has threatened and even eliminated jobs around the world for more than a century, often slowing automation’s growth. In China, there are fewer obstacles than practically anywhere else. China has no independent labor unions, and Communist Party control leaves almost no room for dissent.</p><p>Another factor behind China’s automation drive is the country’s demographic crisis.</p><p>The number of babies born each year has dropped by almost two-thirds since 1987. At the same time, two-thirds of people turning 18 now enroll at a university or college, an educational trajectory that has allowed a new generation to aspire to careers outside factory labor.</p><p>“China’s demographic dividend is over,” said Stephen Dyer, head of the Asia industrial practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. “They’re now in a demographic deficit, and the only way out of that is productivity.”</p><p>Li You<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Keith Bradsher is the Beijing bureau chief for The Times.
