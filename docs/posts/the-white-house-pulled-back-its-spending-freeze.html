The directive had been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.</p><p>By rescinding the order, the Trump administration appeared to ease concerns from hospitals, nonprofits and others who had spent the last two days scrambling to understand if they had lost their federal financial support. It was Trump’s first major capitulation of his second term.</p><p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, insisted this afternoon that “This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze.” She appeared to be referring to the fact that the president signed executive orders last week directing government agencies to review and eliminate spending on so-called woke ideologies. Those measures remain in force.</p><p>Trump is now expected to pursue other ways of eliminating voices of dissent inside the federal government. Yesterday, for example, his administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-federal-workers-buyout.html" title="">offered roughly two million government employees the option to resign</a> and continue being paid for several months. Many of his approaches could defy the law — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-firings-officials-legal-test.html" title="">but a legal challenge may be exactly what he wants</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert F.

Kennedy Jr., whose antipathy toward vaccines helped him build a large national following, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/rfk-jr-health-senate-hearing" title="">faced three hours of bruising questions today</a> during in his first Senate confirmation hearing to become health secretary. He rejected accusations that he was anti-vaccine and repeatedly sought to steer the conversation toward different topics, like combating chronic disease.</p><p>One of Kennedy’s most important exchanges today was with Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican physician from Louisiana <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/rfk-jr-republicans-mcconnell.html" title="">whose vote is expected to be crucial</a>. When Cassidy asked about Medicare and Medicaid, Kennedy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/health/medicaid-medicare-rfk-jr.html" title="">appeared to have little familiarity with the enormous health insurance programs</a>, at times seeming to confuse them.</p><p>Kennedy, who will sit for another confirmation hearing tomorrow, “has made plain that he intends to do things a different way,” our heath policy reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg said. “He has spent the better part of the last decade or more sowing doubts about some of the very agencies that he would oversee.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert Menendez arriving at Manhattan federal court, today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-7132de34">Menendez was sentenced to 11 years in prison</h2><p>Robert Menendez, the former New Jersey Senator and once one of the most powerful Democrats in Washington, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/nyregion/bob-menendez-corruption-sentencing.html" title="">sentenced today to 11 years in prison</a>.

Some experts wondered if screen time and school absence are among the causes.
