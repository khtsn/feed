China leveled the latest salvo on Wednesday, bringing its across-the-board levies on American imports to 84 percent.</p><p>President Trump said on Wednesday that he did not think he would need to raise tariffs on China higher than 125 percent and that he expected Xi Jinping, China’s leader, to reach out about a deal. “I can’t imagine it. I don’t think we’ll have to do it more,” he said of additional tariffs on China. “No, I don’t see that.”</p><p>In trading on Thursday, stocks listed in Hong Kong gained around 2 percent, while those listed in Shanghai gained about 1 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, said that Mr. Trump’s latest moves show a shift in focus from reducing America’s trade deficits to gearing up for a trade war with China.</p><p>That means “risks have not been all that significantly reduced” for many countries like Japan and South Korea, which count China and the United States as their top trade partners, Mr. Kiuchi said.</p><p>The Chinese government has taken steps to stabilize its markets. State-owned companies on Tuesday announced they were buying back some shares, a move that typically helps push stock prices higher. On Thursday, an influential state media outlet published a commentary saying it was a good time for the central bank to lower interest rates and take other steps that would support the economy.</p><p>Over the past week, Mr. Trump’s trade broadsides have sent markets into a tailspin and threatened to upend global trade. Even after the rally on Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 remains roughly 12 percent below its February peak. It was also the index’s worst start to a presidential term since the dot-com bubble burst at the start of 2001.</p><p>In Asia, stock benchmarks have dropped around 12 percent in Japan, and more than 16 percent in Taiwan this year. South Korea’s Kospi index has remained roughly flat.</p><p>Ryan Young, a senior economist with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said Mr. Trump’s pivot on tariffs was a relief. But he remains concerned that uncertainty about future policies will continue to paralyze long-term investment. The administration’s tariff actions “have already done a lot of damage, and this pause does not undo it,” Mr. Young said. “Markets want stability.”</p><p>Berry Wang<!-- --> contributed research from Hong Kong.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.</p></div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Law Firms’ No-Win Situation:</strong> If they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-law-firms-orders.html">resist President Trump’s pressure</a>, the firms jeopardize their bottom line, exposing themselves to executive orders that imperil their businesses.
