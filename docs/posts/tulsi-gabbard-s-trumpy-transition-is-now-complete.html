But it did little to quell the anger among many Israelis over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s resistance to a cease-fire deal that would bring home all the remaining hostages — dead and alive.</p><p>The details of the rescue were not immediately clear. The Israeli military spoke of a “complex military operation.” Unnamed senior Israeli officials told The Times that commandos were scouring Hamas tunnels when they came upon Farhan al-Qadi, 52, a member of Israel’s Bedouin minority who was working at a kibbutz when he was seized in the Hamas raid of Oct. 7. In either case, he was the eighth hostage to be freed by the military.</p><p>With the latest rescue, 108 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, including 13 whose deaths have been confirmed, according to Haaretz. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group that represents the families of the hostages, said that the rest cannot hope to be freed by military operations. “A deal is the only way to secure the return of the remaining 108 hostages — the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial,” it <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/08/27/israeli-hostage-rescued-gaza-updates/74962676007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>A deal seemed tantalizingly close at the end of May, when President Biden reported progress toward a phased cease-fire that would lead to the liberation of all remaining hostages and end the grueling fight that has taken more than 40,000 Palestinian lives. But since then, both Netanyahu and Yahya Sinwar, the elusive Hamas leader in Gaza, have repeatedly put roadblocks in the way of an agreement, with Netanyahu insisting on the full destruction of Hamas and Sinwar saying he would accept only a permanent end to hostilities. Last week Secretary of State Antony Blinken, told reporters that a bridging proposal offered by Washington was probably the best — and possibly the last — opportunity for a deal. The last round of talks ended in Cairo on Sunday without one.</p><p>Netanyahu’s insistence on a decisive victory has placed him at odds not only with the hostages’ families but also with the Israeli military, which questions whether a total victory over Hamas is feasible and is concerned about a potential clash with Hezbollah. More broadly, polls have shown that a majority of Israelis support a cease-fire in exchange for the hostages.</p><p>Al-Qadi did not join the debate as he profusely thanked those responsible for his liberation. But in a meeting with the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, al-Qadi urged the government “to do everything to bring people home.”</p><p>“Twenty-four hours without sleep,” he said. “People are suffering, suffering you can’t imagine.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzcyODZlOWNjLTZiYTQtNWQ5YS04OTY1LWI2NDU4ZDk5NjkyMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#tulsi-gabbard-trump-transition" data-source-id="100000009660454"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-27T18:45:43.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 27, 2024, 2:45 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Step back, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. You aren’t even the most interesting ex-Democrat-turned-MAGA-tool to endorse Donald Trump this month.</p><p>For my money, that would be Tulsi Gabbard, the former House member and 2020 contender to unseat President Trump.</p><p>Gabbard has been on quite the political journey. She never got much traction in her 2020 race. But she did win herself a small but intensely passionate following based heavily on her isolationist leanings — which, admittedly, are more electrifying than most, thanks to her penchant for making indulgent statements about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/tulsi-gabbard-syria/508367/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bloodthirsty strongmen</a> such as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/07/politics/tulsi-gabbard-assad-chemical-weapons-blitzer-cnntv" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bashar al-Assad</a> and Vladimir Putin. Indeed, Gabbard’s soft-on-Russia musings have been at times so striking that Hillary Clinton publicly called her “a Russian asset,” prompting Gabbard to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-sues-hillary-clinton_n_5e285903c5b6779e9c2b5d34" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sue</a> Clinton for defamation. (Gabbard later <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/politics/tulsi-gabbard-clinton-lawsuit/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dropped</a> the suit.)</p><p>Gabbard <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/tulsi-gabbard-announces-leaving-democratic-party-rcna51659" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quit</a> the Democratic Party in 2022 and became an independent, saying it had fallen “under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness,” and promptly began making nice with the red team. She <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/04/the-gops-new-russia-friendly-campaign-trail-buddy-tulsi-gabbard-00065024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit the campaign trail</a> for Republican candidates in the midterms. She <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/politics/tulsi-gabbard-cpac-ukraine-russia/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference</a>. Conveniently, she was already a hot guest on Fox News.</p><p>For this election, she has settled snugly into the MAGA fold — all the more so since Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee. Gabbard has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/trump-debate-tulsi-gabbard.html" title="">helping Trump with his debate prep</a>. During a primary debate in 2019, you may recall, Gabbard hit Harris hard from the left — successfully enough to leave a mark and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/politics/tulsi-gabbard-kamala-harris-debate/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tick off Harris</a>. Trump, who has been struggling to figure out how to deal with his new opponent, is clearly hoping some of Gabbard’s mojo rubs off on him.</p><p>Just in case anyone had any doubts as to her new allegiance, Gabbard <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?&amp;q=tulsi+gabbard+trump+National+Guard+Association+of+the+United+States&amp;qpvt=tulsi+gabbard+trump+National+Guard+Association+of+the+United+States&amp;mid=FC5D12150DECF98052EDFC5D12150DECF98052ED&amp;&amp;FORM=VRDGAR" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endorsed</a> Trump on Monday. They appeared together at a National Guard conference in Detroit, on the third anniversary of the bombing in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members. A National Guard veteran, Gabbard asserted that Trump “understands the grave responsibility that a president and commander in chief bears for every single one of our lives.”</p><p>The next day, Trump announced that Gabbard was joining his transition team, as is Mr. Kennedy.</p><p>Team Trump is presumably betting that bringing on former Democrats will send a signal that his campaign is the one with a big tent and mainstream appeal. But when we’re talking about characters as … colorful as Gabbard and Kennedy, I’m betting the signal to many voters is that Trump’s G.O.P. is the home of the politically strange.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzc0NzM1MmRlLWVmZTctNWQ0YS1hMDYzLTc4MDg1MzcxZWE5Mw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#pavel-durov-telegram-arrest" data-source-id="100000009659818"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zeynep-tufekci"><img alt="Zeynep Tufekci" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-27T16:05:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 27, 2024, 12:05 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The detention in France of Pavel Durov, the founder and chief executive of the messaging app Telegram, has sparked a loud outcry about free speech. Elon Musk has portrayed the arrest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/technology/pavel-durov-telegram-detained-france.html" title="">on his X account</a> as an ominous threat to free speech, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. referred to the app as an “encrypted, uncensored” platform and said “the need to protect free speech has never been more urgent.”</p><p>It’s a curious case, and the French government hasn’t helped matters by releasing information in dribs and drabs. While it is possible that there are free speech issues entangled here, some early details suggest the issue may be one of criminal activity.</p><p>On Monday, the French prosecutor said in a statement that Durov — who is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/telegram-pavel-durov-arrest-2c8015c102cce23c23d55c6ca82641c5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a citizen</a> of France, Russia, St. Kitts and Nevis and the United Arab Emirates — was being held for questioning in connection with an investigation into criminal activities on the app, including the trading of child sexual abuse material as well as drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering. Notably, Telegram explicitly boasts that it has never disclosed user data to any government, ever.</p><p>Questions have long swirled around Telegram. Contrary to widespread belief, Telegram is not encrypted in any meaningful sense. That would be “end to end” encryption, so that even the company couldn’t read users’ messages. Telegram — and anyone it chooses — can read all group chats, and there is no way to fully encrypt them. Those very large groups are the main attraction of the platform.</p><p>Private chats on Telegram also lack end-to-end encryption by default. Here, though, users can undergo an onerous process to turn on end-to-end encryption, which then applies only to that conversation. Even the protection provided to private chats is murky: <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/08/25/telegram-is-not-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cryptography experts have long questioned</a> whether Telegram’s limited encryption actually meets security standards.</p><p>Durov was born in Russia, where Telegram is used widely. The Kremlin has Durov’s back: It <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/27/russia-warns-france-over-telegram-founder-pavel-durovs-detainment.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a statement that</a> unless more evidence is provided, Durov’s detention may be “a direct attempt to limit freedom of communication.” Russian antiwar activists <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-kremlin-has-entered-the-chat/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have long wondered</a> how the Kremlin seems to know so much about their activities on Telegram. (Good question.)</p><p>Free speech is an important value, but protecting it does not mean absolving anyone of responsibility for all criminal activity. Ironically, Telegram’s shortage of end-to-end encryption means the company is likely to be more liable simply because it <em>can</em> see the criminal activity happening on its platform. If, for example, Telegram did not cooperate with authorities at all after receiving legal warrants for information about criminal activities, that would mean trouble even in the United States, with its sweeping free speech protections.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RlMzYxOWI3LWY4Y2QtNTZhNS1iNDdmLWE4NWI3YjA5OWU5Mw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#nasa-starliner-astronauts-space" data-source-id="100000009658807"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neel-v--patel"><img alt="Neel V.

What was supposed to be a weeklong mission to the International Space Station will now be an eight-month stay in space, after the spacecraft they launched aboard, the Boeing Starliner, experienced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/02/opinion/thepoint/yes-the-starliner-is-stuck-in-space?smid=url-share" title="">some unexpected glitches</a>.</p><p>Boeing has been utterly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/boeing-starliner-space-defense-business-nasa-8e5f6414629efcc0a78d43fb9c778333" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">humiliated</a> by the Starliner’s failure, not least because the company’s rival, SpaceX, will take Wilmore and Williams home. But it’s NASA that deserves applause: Faced with an unsettling turn of events for its human spaceflight program, the agency has gotten a couple of things right.</p><p>It got the first thing right nearly a decade ago. In September 2014, NASA awarded contracts to both SpaceX and Boeing for their commercial crew programs, effectively saying it would pay two companies to develop new spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts to and from the space station. The veteran aerospace firm Boeing was awarded $4.2 billion, while the newcomer SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion.</p><p>While both companies’ programs were mired in delays, SpaceX eventually vaulted ahead of Boeing and pulled off a successful crewed flight to space in 2020. Boeing remained sluggish. Throughout this period, NASA emphasized that the whole reason it gave contracts to two companies in the first place was in case one company hit snags. The wisdom of that choice is on full display now, as Wilmore and Williams can return home on a SpaceX mission, after the Boeing mission went awry. Redundancy paid off.</p><p>NASA got one other thing right during this debacle. Though Wilmore and Williams are trapped in space until February, the agency is wisely playing it safe. There isn’t much reason to think the Starliner couldn’t securely bring the astronauts back to Earth. But NASA is choosing not to risk a repeat of the tragic Challenger and Columbia disasters. Taking risks is a fundamental part of spaceflight, but the United States is no longer in a race to beat the Soviets. NASA can and should take its time to reduce the odds of risk whenever possible. It’s the right thing to do.</p><p>The astronauts’ delayed return must be truly aggravating for both of them and their families. But it’s unquestionably preferable to an alternative outcome that would put them both in any sort of elevated danger.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Y3YzE4YTkzLTNlMWItNWQzOC04NjEzLWE3ZjE0M2YyMGJhMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#gus-walz-cry-dnc" data-source-id="100000009656960"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-26T19:08:13.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 26, 2024, 3:08 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Gus Walz’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/style/gus-walz-dnc-social-media.html" title="">unbridled emotional reaction</a> last week at the Democratic National Convention to the nomination of his father, Gov. Tim Walz, embodied both the humanity that lies beneath the political process and the momentousness of the political process itself.</p><p>In other words, Gus reacted the way he did because he recognized the import of his father’s nomination. And because the man onstage was his father — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBrnKM0jo40" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“That’s my dad!”</a> — a man who raised and <a href="https://people.com/gus-walz-learning-disorder-secret-power-exclusive-8691793" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported and accepted</a> and loved him for who he is, a 17-year-old boy with anxiety and a learning disorder and, as Tina Brown wrote in her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/tim-walz-son-gus.html" title="">gorgeous essay</a> on Friday, a human being like any other.</p><p>Gus’s reaction was beautiful. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/democratic-convention-tim-walz-son-emotions-criticized-backlash" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">then things got ugly</a>.</p><p>In response to Gus’s exuberance, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ann-coulter-roast-goes-viral-as-internet-gets-revenge-for-gus-walz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ann Coulter posted</a> on X, “Talk about weird …” (She later took her post down.) “Sorry, but this is embarrassing for both father and son,” the conservative radio host Jay Weber posted. “If the Walzs represent today’s American man, this country is screwed,” he said, adding a crude insult of the teenage Walz. (He, too, removed his post.)</p><p>Perhaps they didn’t know the context. They didn’t know anything about Gus Walz beyond the politics of his father. They didn’t realize they should have been kind. Few people do before issuing a least-charitable-interpretation potshot. People’s private lives, their psychological state, their family or personal circumstances and their disabilities are often invisible. This is as true for public figures as it is for private citizens. Gus didn’t deserve “special” treatment — he deserved the kind of treatment any person does.</p><p>If nothing else, Gus reminds us of what an unfiltered human reaction looks like and what a sharp contrast it makes with the noxious swill of performance, hot takes and low blows that passes for online political commentary.</p><p>Let’s dwell on that contrast for a moment. Gus’s surge of emotion offered an image of us at our all-too-human best. Those who chose to disparage him reeked of our all-too-human worst. Gus Walz showed us what it means to really care about other people.

I’m especially curious how she’s faring in Pennsylvania and Georgia, which are the most critical battlegrounds in the race. Given Harris’s and the convention’s focus on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/tim-walz-small-town-conservatives.html" title="">themes</a> like patriotism, small-town values and the economy, I can see her gaining a couple of points in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Democrats’ hammering of Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/kamala-harris-speech.html" title="">on abortion</a> is also going to help Harris in Pennsylvania and Arizona, where abortion rights is a hot-button issue.</p><figure><figcaption><div><h3>The Democrats’ Joyfest is Over. Now Comes The Slugfest.</h3><p><span>Kamala Harris was flying high last week, but Donald Trump is poised to bring her back down to earth.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure><p>But consider this: Harris has won the vast majority of news cycles since she declared her candidacy. And yet, she is only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">two or three percentage points</a> ahead of Trump in the national polling average and effectively tied with him in the seven swing states that will decide the election. Structural factors — polarization, the gender gap, Republicans’ advantage in the Electoral College — are keeping this race tight.</p><p>To that end, with early voting only weeks away, the battle between Harris and Trump will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/kamala-harris-democratic-convention.html" title="">to find the best strategies</a> for the three most important elements of this campaign.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Defining the race:</strong> Harris wants to make the race about the future, freedom and unity; Trump wants to make the race about the past, his presidency and threats to the country. Harris has effectively cast the race as a choice between her and Trump, which helps her because he is so unpopular. But there is still time for this to change, especially if an unexpected or outside event suddenly shifts voter attention to safety or national security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Defining Harris:</strong> So far, Harris is also winning on this front, positioning herself as the candidate of change — an appealing image to many voters. Trump is trying to define her as “<a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/f71c6a76-44ae-4cd3-adc8-b775decdc52a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dangerously liberal</a>” and as the de facto incumbent, but even some Republican strategists tell me that they don’t see strong evidence this is catching on. Trump will campaign in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania later this week; watch for whether he starts trying to define her anew.</p></li><li><p><strong>Defining Trump:</strong> The former president is struggling. He is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/trump-abortion-truth-social.html" title="">trying to appeal</a> to moderate and independent voters by opposing a national abortion ban and talking about the economy; if he had the discipline to bear down on the cost of living, trade and immigration, he’d be doing better than he is in Pennsylvania, where those issues resonate. But as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik put it to me, the only way Trump can win the presidency is by turning out his vote strongly and edging out his opponent with sufficient numbers of swing voters — which is what he did successfully in 2016.</p></li></ul><p>Right now, Harris has the momentum, but I think the Electoral College <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">currently</a> <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/georgia/trump-vs-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">favors</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/25/us-news/james-carville-warns-kamala-harris-polls-arent-as-good-as-they-look/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/harris-battleground-state-tour.html" title="">Nothing will be more critical</a> than the Sept. 10 debate to define the race, Trump and Harris. A debate changes things in an instant. Just ask Joe Biden.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
