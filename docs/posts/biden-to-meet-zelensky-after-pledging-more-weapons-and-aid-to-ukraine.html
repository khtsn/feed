    <h1>Biden to Meet Zelensky After Pledging More Weapons and Aid to Ukraine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Biden will meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the White House on Thursday after announcing a new slate of military weapons and nearly $8 billion of aid for the country’s fight against Russia.</p><p>Mr. Biden made the announcement as Mr. Zelensky traveled to Washington as a part of an effort to urge the administration and Congress to continue bolstering Ukraine’s effort to fend off Russia’s invasion, now in its third year. Mr. Biden also said he would provide Ukraine with glide bombs used by F-16 fighter jets, known as joint standoff weapons, as well as an additional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/us/politics/patriot-missiles-russia-ukraine-us.html" title="">Patriot battery</a> and air defense missiles.</p><p>“For nearly three years, the United States has rallied the world to stand with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom from Russian aggression, and it has been a top priority of my administration to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to prevail,” Mr. Biden said in a statement as he commended the country’s efforts to defend its capital, Kyiv. “But there is more work to do. That is why, today, I am announcing a surge in security assistance for Ukraine and a series of additional actions to help Ukraine win this war.”</p><p>Mr. Zelensky has used his visit to the United States this week — including an address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Wednesday — to urge the administration to equip his nation with additional arms and authorize his military to strike deeper into Russia with Western missiles. The Biden administration has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/biden-ukraine-weapons.html" title="">considering such a move</a>, but Mr. Biden has not yet given the green light.</p></div></div>
