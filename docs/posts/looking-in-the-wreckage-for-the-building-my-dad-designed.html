He told me that buildings have many stages of life, as all beings do. First, for a designer, they exist in your mind, as part of you. Then you draw them, mold them into something better. And then they get built, and exist in the world.</p><p>I’d seen his buildings at just about every stage, from pencil sketches in notebooks to construction sites to finished products. But I’d never seen one after death.</p><p>The truth is, he’d forgotten about 822 Haverford Avenue, even though it had been special to him once. It was the first of his designs to be built, a career milestone for him back then, in 1980. He was 28, just a couple of years older than I am now, and fresh out of graduate school. Seeing it go up, he said, made him feel for the first time that he was a real architect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A drawing by the author’s father of 822 Haverford Avenue. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Flood, Meyer, Sutton &amp; Associates, via Dennis McFadden</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“You realize you have some agency and you have some skills and some power to make something,” he told me. “Building a building, for architects anyway, is leaving a permanent mark on the world.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>We were certain that mark was gone now: The condo complex at 822 Haverford Avenue was in the middle of the area devastated by the Palisades fire.</p><p>He pulled out a dusty portfolio and we pored over it at the kitchen table in the Los Angeles house where he lives and where I grew up. We flipped through laminated pages of plans, hand-drawn in careful black ink, and grainy photographs taken when the building was brand-new.</p><p>“I was a workaholic, not too much different than what I am now,” he said.</p><p>I went looking the next day for the building my dad had designed more than 40 years ago.</p><p>Fire has a way of equalizing. When I got out of my car in Pacific Palisades, each lot looked pretty much the same: one set of rubble next to one set of rubble next to another. I tried to make out the design elements my dad had described the night before.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Two doorways stood precariously over a pit of ashy wreckage. These, I supposed, had been entrances to the first two units. I recognized the thin black window frames — once-rectangular portals placed strategically to give the units privacy and a view of Temescal Canyon. Those window frames survived, strangely intact, like angular line drawings dotting the wreckage.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view looking into the destroyed condo complex.

He flipped through them, silent. “Devastating to look at,” he said after a while. “Shocking.”</p><p>My dad never knew who lived inside 822 Haverford. He hopes they liked it, and that it made a good home. What he told me about buildings being alive was only part of the story, it turns out.</p><p>“You send it out into the world to have a great life,” he said. “And it’s really only alive because of the people who live in it.” </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
