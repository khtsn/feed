    <h1>Appeals Court Again Blocks U.S. From Cutting Texas Border Wire Along Rio Grande</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A district court judge declined to give Texas the injunction it requested, finding that the federal government was likely to win the ongoing case because of sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine that can often shield state and federal governments from lawsuits. In December 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/us/texas-border-wire-biden-administration.html" title="">issued a temporary order</a> limiting the Biden administration’s ability to remove the wire only in cases of medical emergencies. That ruling was vacated by the Supreme Court in January, sending the case back to the lower courts.</p><p>Wednesday’s order, from the Fifth Circuit, rejected claims by the Biden administration that sovereign immunity and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution meant that Texas couldn’t challenge federal actions along the border. Texas, the appeals court found, was seeking “not to ‘regulate’ Border Patrol, but only to safeguard its own property.”</p><p>The Fifth Circuit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/us/new-orleans-appeals-court-trump.html" title="">has been hailed</a> by some Trump-aligned Republicans as a model for the future of conservative jurisprudence. Three of its judges are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/trump-supreme-court-nominees-list.html" title="">often discussed</a> as possible Supreme Court nominees during President-elect Donald J. Trump’s second term. One of those three, Stuart Kyle Duncan, wrote Wednesday’s ruling.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1861902296520511506" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>, Mr. Paxton called Wednesday’s ruling a “huge win,” and said that his office had “fought every step of the way for Texas sovereignty and security.”</p><p>The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
