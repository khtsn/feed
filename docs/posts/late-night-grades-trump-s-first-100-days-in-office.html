It’s been an historic 100 days — some would say prehistoric.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/okSzGyHFs_4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“Today was President Trump’s 100th day in office. Well, 100th day as president, fourth day in office.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“Yes, it has been 100 days of Trump in the Oval Office. I mean that figuratively. Obviously, he spent lots of those days in the steam room at Mar-a-Lago.” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p><p>“It is difficult to give Trump’s first 100 days a grade, but if I had to, I’d say it falls somewhere between ‘F’ and ‘U.’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Let’s be honest: It’s been a bumpy ride. I mean, who knew renaming the Gulf of Mexico might actually be his high point?” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“To mark 100 days in office, Trump kicked off a multiday media blitz that the White House is framing as a victory lap. Yep, and now all he needs is a victory.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“And the whole 100 days thing started back in 1933, right, when F.D.R.’s extraordinary productivity set a first-100-days standard against which all future presidents would be measured. And I think it’s appropriate to compare him to F.D.R., because Trump is well on his way to bringing back polio.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-b97be7c">The Punchiest Punchlines (Mark Carney Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“With Carney’s victory, Canadians rejected his younger, much Trumpier opponent, Pierre Poilievre, which must be a relief for Trump, ’cause now he never has to try to say that guy’s name.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Don’t mess with Canada. They may be polite. You tick them off, they’re like John Wick after they killed his dog.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>”You take that, Trump. That’s what happens when you mess with a country whose national pastime is ‘bar fight on ice.&#39;” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“But, yes, thanks to Trump, the Liberal Party just pulled off a historic comeback, winning all the major Canadian demographics: hockey moms, hockey dads, hockey non-binaries, hockey seniors, hockey hockey players, and, of course, hot Ryans.” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Will Ferrell and Stephen Colbert “Rickrolled” viewers during Tuesday’s “Late Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-1f978490">What We’re Excited About on Wednesday Night</h2><p>John Cale and Maggie Rogers will perform together on “Everybody’s Live With Mulaney.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nearly three hours long, the concert was a characteristic Beyoncé epic.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/arts/music/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tour-review.html" title="">Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter Tour</a>, kicking off on Monday night in Inglewood, Calif., transformed the star’s personal and musical reclamation into a joyful extravaganza.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
