He has made himself increasingly scarce in Washington. And months after he served as the 2024 election’s biggest donor, he said on Tuesday that he planned to spend “a lot less” in future elections.</p><p>It was the latest sign that Mr. Musk is fading into the background of American politics — at least for now.</p><p>“In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” the tech titan said as he appeared virtually for a combative interview with Bloomberg News at the Qatar Economic Forum. “I think I’ve done enough.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Asked if his thinking stemmed from the “blowback” he had faced for helping to guide the Trump administration — a role that has created wide-ranging <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/elon-musk-spacex-trump-budget.html" title="">conflicts</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/technology/elon-musk-boring-company-amtrak.html" title="">interest</a> — Mr. Musk dodged the question and left the door open for future outlays on elections.</p><p>“If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,” he said. “But I don’t currently see a reason.”</p><p>The comments were Mr. Musk’s most explicit yet about whether he wants to keep using his hundreds of billions to try to align the country with his right-wing worldview.</p><p>After the last election, in which he disclosed over $290 million in federal spending, he was widely expected to remain a powerful financial player in Republican politics. On election night, as he flew to Mar-a-Lago, he vowed to play a big role in not only the 2026 midterm contests but also “intermediate elections.” He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-donation.html" title="">signaled to President Trump’s advisers</a> that he wanted to donate about $100 million to pro-Trump groups before the midterms. Along with an allied group, he spent roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-crawford-schimel.html" title="">$25 million on a major Wisconsin Supreme Court race</a> to back a conservative candidate who lost badly.</p><p>But the Wisconsin race may have been a turning point: Mr. Musk appears aware that his public presence in the race backfired, according to a person who has spoken with him. He has said almost nothing — in interviews or on X — about the defeat of Brad Schimel, his chosen candidate in the State Supreme Court contest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Public polling shows that Mr. Musk has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-doge-tesla.html" title="">grown unpopular</a> with voters, and Democrats have rushed to use him as a political foil while Republicans have begun to keep some distance from him.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators protesting Mr. Musk before a town-hall event he held in March in Green Bay, Wis., to support a conservative candidate in the state’s Supreme Court election. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But whether Mr. Musk will ultimately cut off all or most of his political donations remains unclear. One possibility is that he returns to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/elon-musk-trump.html" title="">tactic</a> that he used before the 2024 election: funneling money into politics through nonprofit groups, which are not required to disclose their donors.</p><p>Mr. Musk has not left Mr. Trump’s side completely: He accompanied the president last week for part of a Middle East trip that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/middleeast/gulf-deal-making-spree-also-benefited-elon-musk-and-his-family.html" title="">raised new questions</a> about how the tech billionaire, his family and his companies are benefiting financially from his government role.</p><p>And Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk do not have a poor relationship now, according to people with insight into their actions. The president has taken pains to include Mr. Musk in certain activities; after Mr. Trump was noticeably cold to Mr. Musk in a cabinet meeting, the president invited him to a U.F.C. fight in Miami.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Still, Mr. Trump has suggested to associates in recent weeks that it was time for Mr. Musk’s role to wind down. Mr. Musk said in a CNBC interview on Tuesday that he expected to be in Washington for “a couple days every few weeks,” but a person briefed on his plans said the visits might be more sporadic.</p><p>That is a big shift from the first months of the Trump administration, when Mr. Musk was a constant presence in Washington as he steered an ambitious, controversial effort to cut government spending sharply, called the Department of Government Efficiency. On Tuesday, Mr. Musk defended the effort, which is widely seen as falling short of his wild projections as it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">overstates its progress</a>.</p><p>Mr. Musk, an all-hours-of-the-night poster on X, his social media platform, has been weighing in less there about Mr. Trump, and writing far fewer posts overall in recent weeks. In March, he averaged 103 posts a day, but in April, he dropped to just 52 a day. And while he still engages with political content, a majority of his posts have shifted from promotion of the president to ruminations and predictions about his companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and xAI.</p><p>Indeed, the shift appears prompted by the renewed financial pressures that Mr. Musk is facing from his businesses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Musk campaigned frequently for Mr. Trump during the 2024 presidential race. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>His support for Mr. Trump has led <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk.html" title="">Tesla’s sales to plummet</a> and has caused strife within his companies, as some employees have taken the rare step <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/business/elon-musk-tesla-firing-worker.html" title="">of speaking out</a> against their chief executive’s political activity. Last month, a group of Tesla employees published an open letter calling for his removal as the company’s leader, noting that “the damage done to Elon’s personal brand is now irreversible.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Matthew LaBrot, a program manager who worked at Tesla for more than five years, said he had been fired for organizing the letter, while an X account associated with the employee movement was also suspended.</p><p>“I understood the risks, and I spoke out anyway,” Mr. LaBrot <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthewlabrot_tesla-employees-against-elon-activity-7326284831145758720-LFHK" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on LinkedIn. “Because I believe in Tesla’s mission more than I fear its CEO.”</p><p>Mr. Musk has also pulled resources back to his other companies. Amanda Scales, a human resources executive who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-administration.html" title="">helped lead</a> the Office of Personnel Management as part of his government takeover, recently returned to her role at xAI, according to her LinkedIn.</p><p>After the sharp drop in profit at Tesla, Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html" title="">told Wall Street analysts last month</a> that he planned to spend less time on politics and more on his companies.</p><p>He did say on Tuesday, however, that he planned to be in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday — including for a dinner with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Kate Conger<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering billionaires and their impact on the world.</p></div><div><p>Ryan Mac covers corporate accountability across the global technology industry.</p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent for The Times, reporting on President Trump.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
