    <h1>DRX and PRX enter familiar territory as top seeds entering playoffs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>Surprise results and landmark finishes marked the final week of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2/group-stage" target="_blank">VCT Pacific Stage 2</a> group stage. The eight-team playoff field has been set, with most of the specific seedings not decided until the final matchday.</p>

<p>Here are the results from week four:</p>



<p>The final week of the group stage kicked off with quite possibly the most important match. On one side of the stage, Gen.G had the chance to capture the top seed of Group Alpha, while Nongshim RedForce looked to punch its ticket to the playoffs to keep its quest for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a>, and in turn, survival in VCT, alive. In this match, Nongshim had the perfect read on Gen.G in-game leader <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2489/munchkin">
		Munchkin	</a>
</span>. From reading his lurk timings on Lotus to mollying the positions he typically plays on Ascent, the Ascension squad flipped Gen.G&#39;s trademark map pick and then stood strong for an overtime win on their own pick. The win put Gen.G in limbo, relying on the results of other teams to see if they&#39;d start in the upper or lower bracket, while Nongshim clinched entry into the playoffs.</p>


<p><em>Gutsy trigger discipline from <span data-ref-id="13">

</span>.</em></p>

<p>In a clash between two of the hottest SEA teams in the region, Paper Rex found the edge over TALON, shutting the Thai squad down 2-0 to claim Group Omega&#39;s top seed. A key performance from full-time Duelist player <span data-ref-id="14">

	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9803/d4v41">
		d4v41	</a>
</span>&#39;s efforts on the day, the duo combined for 100 kills. The two players were hand in hand at the top of the leaderboard. TALON, with a win over T1 and a loss to DFM, secured at least third place, meaning their starting position in the playoffs would remain unchanged.</p>


<p><em>Clean shots from something but... no ace.</em></p>

<p>While DRX secured its playoff future weeks in advance, a 2-0 win over Global Esports guaranteed a bye from the first round by clinching Group Omega&#39;s top seed. Global was already sealed out of the playoffs and mathematically eliminated from qualifying for Champions, but still threatened to stun the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/vct-2025-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> winners. Global held a 9-5 lead on DRX&#39;s pick of Lotus, but once the Korean squad picked up steam on its attacker half, it was too late. DRX won eight of the next nine rounds from that point to win 13-10. If Lotus had a lean towards any particular side of the map, Icebox didn&#39;t. Momentum changed hands often, but in the end it was DRX winning by the same 13-10 scoreline. There were three aces in the map, with seven multikills of four or higher lighting up the kills timeline.</p>

<p>In a battle between two teams looking to avoid the bottom spot of Group Omega, ZETA DIVISION toughed out a 2-1 win over BOOM Esports. The result solidified a 0-5 finish to the stage for BOOM, and broke a six-game run of matches without picking up a map. After the teams won their respective map picks, ZETA dominated on Ascent, picking up six rounds on their attacker side before dominating on defense to win 13-8. BOOM&#39;s fate now relies on the final championship point standings, as a top-eight finish would earn them an invite to Pacific Ascension and a finish outside would mean relegation to Challengers.</p>

<p>On the final day of play, Rex Regum Qeon and Team Secret&#39;s clash threatened to turn Group Omega upside down. A Team Secret win would send RRQ home with TS into the playoffs as the fourth seed, while an RRQ win would grant the Indonesian squad the second seed. Additionally, Gen.G relied on a Team Secret win to avoid the fourth seed. Team Secret&#39;s map pick of Ascent was one for the ages. After entering halftime down 9-3 and then losing the next three rounds, the Filipino side pushed forward to force overtime and eventually to a 15-13 win. However, that level of success was missing on the next two maps, as Team Secret managed just seven total rounds to lose the series 2-1.</p>

<p>In the final match of the group stage, T1 and DFM met with seeding implications also on the line. While the losing team would be slotted into the fourth seed, a T1 win would put them in the second seed, while a DFM win would boost them to second. T1 played identical comps on DFM&#39;s Sunset and their own Haven, and rookie Controller <span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/43057/dh">
		DH	</a>
</span> continued to impress. He finished with a match-high 1.27 rating, heavily involved in everything T1 was doing. He finished with a 26/22/23 scoreline. The series was never quite close. On DFM&#39;s Sunset, T1 began on attack and ran out to a 9-3 lead, never looking back to win 13-6. On their own pick of Haven, T1 gave up just four DFM attacker rounds, cruising along to a 13-9 win to close the series.</p>



<p>The Stage 2 playoffs will begin next week with several teams searching for crucial wins. While Nongshim and TALON will look to fight for automatic qualification to Champions, RRQ and T1 will look to find a top-five finish, which could be enough to qualify through points.</p>
