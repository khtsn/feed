subtitles. Now will Emmy voters reward one with the industry’s biggest prize?</p><p>“Shogun,” FX’s luscious, big-budget chronicle of 17th-century feudal Japan, is poised to have a big night at the Emmy Awards on Sunday, standing as the heavy favorite for best drama.</p><p>The show is off to a blazing start. “Shogun” won 14 technical and acting awards last weekend at the Creative Arts Emmys. That means it has already set a record for the most Emmys won by a show in a single year, eclipsing the 2008 HBO mini-series “John Adams,” which had won 13. “Shogun” is nominated six more times on Sunday, including for best drama, as well as best actor (Hiroyuki Sanada) and actress (Anna Sawai).</p><p>If “Shogun” wins best drama, it would be a big breakthrough for a foreign-language series. Though it was made by an American network (FX, which is owned by Disney) and appeared on a domestic streaming service (Hulu), nearly 70 percent of the show’s dialogue was in Japanese. Foreign-language series like “Squid Game” have won a handful of Emmys but never threatened in a top category like best drama.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Shogun” will face competition from several rookie shows (“Fallout,” Amazon’s popular video game adaptation, and “Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith” among them) along with a former best drama winner, “The Crown.”</p><p>Here’s what else we’re watching for at the Emmys:</p><ul><li><p><strong>‘The Bear’ looks to repeat: </strong>“The Bear” is the favorite to take best comedy for a second consecutive year, and Jeremy Allen White is favored to win again in best actor in a comedy. But some industry insiders have grown exasperated that a show so often described as stressful could even be eligible as a comedy. Could that hurt its chances? Max’s “Hacks,” ABC’s “Abbott Elementary” and HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” are hoping to play the role of spoiler.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Emmy goes to … ?:</strong> There is probably no category more competitive than best actress in a comedy, and it will likely be a showdown among recent winners: Jean Smart (“Hacks”), Ayo Edebiri (“The Bear”) and Quinta Brunson (“Abbott Elementary”).</p></li><li><p><strong>Netflix favored in limited series: </strong>Netflix’s out-of-nowhere hit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/arts/television/baby-reindeer-true-story.html" title="">“Baby Reindeer”</a> is the favorite in a whole swath of limited series categories. And Jodie Foster is looking to win her first Emmy in her role as a small-town police officer in HBO’s latest season of “True Detective.”</p></li><li><p><strong>A new reign for ‘The Daily Show’?: </strong>When Jon Stewart helmed “The Daily Show” in the 2000s and 2010s, he won in the late-night category a whopping 11 times. With Stewart’s once-a-week return in February, “The Daily Show” is poised for another run. Stewart is up against Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘The Traitors’ v. RuPaul: </strong>“RuPaul’s Drag Race” has dominated the reality competition category for the past six years, winning five times. But Peacock’s breakout hit “The Traitors” could very well pull off an upset this year. The host of “The Traitors,” Alan Cumming, already won the Emmy for best host in a reality show at the Creative Arts Emmys last weekend, besting RuPaul.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smaller lineup:</strong> The television industry is in the midst of a contraction, and Sunday’s ceremony will reflect that. The number of shows submitted in the drama and comedy categories plummeted this year. Some categories (like best talk show) even lost nominee slots because of a lack of submissions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Two Emmys, one year:</strong> For the first time in 75 years, there will be two Emmy Awards ceremonies in the same calendar year. The 2023 ceremony was delayed until January because of last year’s Hollywood strikes. That January telecast had just over 4 million viewers, the lowest ever recorded, and producers of the broadcast are hopeful for a turnaround.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Koblin covers the television industry.
