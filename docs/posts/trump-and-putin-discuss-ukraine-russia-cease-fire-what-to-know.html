Putin of Russia agreed on Tuesday during a phone call with President Trump to temporarily halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, according to the Kremlin.</p><p>That fell short of the unconditional 30-day cease-fire that Ukraine had already agreed to, at the urging of the Trump administration. </p><p>The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the two leaders spoke for more than two hours. It was their first known conversation since Ukraine agreed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/us-ukraine-talks-rubio-saudi-arabia.html" title="">support a U.S.-backed monthlong cease-fire</a>, as long as Russia does the same. While Mr. Trump has stated his desire to broker a truce as quickly as possible, Mr. Putin has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/putin-ceasefire-ukraine-trump.html" title="">seemed to be seeking</a> more concessions.</p><p>Tuesday evening, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said President Putin had “effectively rejected the proposal for a full cease-fire” backed by the U.S. and Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Putin made “a number of significant points” about the 30-day cease-fire proposal in the call, according to Tass.

The United States said it would immediately resume providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid.html" title="">which the Trump administration had suspended</a> after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/zelensky-showdown-trump.html" title="">an explosive U.S.-Ukraine meeting</a> at the White House.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The United States and Ukraine also agreed to conclude “as soon as possible” a deal to develop Ukraine’s critical mineral resources.</p><h2 id="link-217770aa">Russia’s stance</h2><p>Before his call with Mr. Trump, the Russian leader had said the idea for a cease-fire was “the right one and we definitely support it” — but laid out numerous conditions that could delay or derail any truce. That included demands that Ukraine cease mobilizing new soldiers, training troops or importing weapons for the duration of any pause in fighting.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have dismissed Mr. Putin’s stance as a cynical ploy to use a pause in fighting to strengthen Russian forces, while preventing Ukraine from doing the same.</p><p>While the Russian description of Tuesday’s two-hour conversation said that Mr. Putin reiterated to Mr. Trump that a complete cessation of military aid to Kyiv is the key condition for ending the conflict, the White House made no mention of that demand, or any discussions over what territory Russia might retain after its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its seizure of about 20 percent of Ukraine’s territory.</p><h2 id="link-690e6a96">Conversation topics</h2><p>Mr. Trump had said on Sunday night that he expected to discuss territorial issues with Mr. Putin as well as the fate of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/europe/putin-trump-russia-ukraine.html" title="">Ukrainian power plants</a>. He also noted that there had already been discussions about “dividing up certain assets.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe we can. Maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance.”</p><p>Mr. Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by assets or power plants, but his comments came on the same day Mr. Witkoff mentioned a “nuclear reactor” in an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-witkoff-middle-east-envoy-face-the-nation-transcript-03-16-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with CBS News</a>.</p><p>That appeared be a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, which Russia seized early in the war and still controls. The six-reactor plant is Europe’s largest, and its proximity to frontline fighting has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/world/europe/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-explainer.html" title="">long raised concerns</a> about the risk of a radiological disaster.</p><p>It was not immediately clear, though, whether discussion about the power plant would focus on Russia giving it up — or finding a way to keep it under any truce.</p><p>The power plant sits near the Dnipro River in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, which Russia has declared it annexed, despite controlling only part of its territory. Surrendering the plant to Ukraine would mean ceding territory Russia considers its own. It would also give Kyiv’s troops a foothold in a Russian-controlled area that has been relatively protected from Ukrainian attacks thanks to the natural barrier of the large Dnipro River.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At the same time, energy experts say, the nuclear plant is in poor condition after three years of war and restoring full operations would require a lot of time and investment from Russia. That could mean Russia might see an incentive to try trading it in negotiations for something else, such as the easing of Western sanctions on the Russian economy, experts say.</p><h2 id="link-1a7310c">State of the war</h2></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-13"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="ukraine-russia-kursk-map-wqm7-" data-id="100000010045603" data-source-id="100000010045603"><div slug="ukraine-russia-kursk-map-wqm7-" data-sourceid="100000010045603" id="embed-id-100000010045603">
