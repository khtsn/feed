But the significant increase in tariffs in recent months appears to have prompted an increase trade and customs fraud.</p><p>I’m Ana Swanson, the international trade reporter for The New York Times. I’m looking for unreported instances of how companies may be avoiding or evading President Trump’s tariffs on foreign goods. To better understand the topic and inform my reporting, I’d like to hear from company owners and employees about what they have seen firsthand. I’d be particularly interested to learn whether companies are trying to avoid tariffs on goods that feed into the supply chains of major corporations. And I want to know what tactics are commonly used to sidestep the impact of tariffs.</p><p>I’ll read every submission and contact you if we’re interested in learning more. I won’t publish any submission without reaching out to you and hearing back. We don’t use your contact information for any reason other than to follow up with you, and we don’t share it outside our newsroom.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
