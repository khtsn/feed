The rockets will speak for themselves.”</p><p>In Moscow, the Kremlin said the Biden administration’s decision to allow Ukrainian forces to strike targets in Russia was a major step toward a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.</p><p>“This escalates tensions to a qualitatively new level,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Monday. The decision represented “a qualitatively new situation in terms of the United States’ involvement in this conflict,” he added, referring to the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The shift in the White House stance will allow Ukraine to use a ballistic missile system called ATACMS (pronounced “attack ’ems”), an abbreviation for Army Tactical Missile System. With a range of 190 miles, these missiles would allow Ukraine to strike military targets that it says would degrade Russia’s military, such as garrisons, logistical hubs and munitions depots that are beyond the reach of its conventional weapons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Calling these installations fair targets by the laws of war, the Zelensky administration had for months asked for broad leeway in hitting these sites, but the Biden administration resisted. The arrival of North Korean troops apparently tipped the scales in favor of approval.</p><p>A Ukrainian official familiar with the negotiations between Kyiv and Washington said Ukraine had been waiting for this decision and fighting for it for over a year. “We’ve always simply said that the greater our long-range capabilities, the faster we will defend Ukraine and end this war,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research organization, released <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8b060c46ee6f49908f9fb415ad23051c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interactive map</a> this summer plotting 225 military installations within the range of ATACMS, including missile brigades, storage facilities, radar installations, airfields used to stage attack helicopters, repair depots, ammunition warehouses and logistics hubs.</p><p>The Biden administration agreed last year to supply several hundred ATACMS to the Ukrainians for use on Ukraine’s own territory, including the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. The Ukrainian military has since used many of these missiles in a campaign of strikes on military targets in Crimea and it is unclear how many missiles remain in Ukraine’s arsenal.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
