The president announced this afternoon that nearly all of his so-called reciprocal tariffs would be paused for 90 days.</p><p>The stock market reacted with glee, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-stock-market" title="">rebounding after a week of sharp declines</a>. The S&amp;P 500 ended the day up 9.5 percent, its largest daily increase since 2008. The tariffs, which Trump had raised to the highest level in a century, had caused economists to warn of recession risks.</p><p>Still, Trump made clear that he is not backing entirely away from the levies. He said that imports from China, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/china-tariffs-us-trump.html" title="">which sharply retaliated today</a>, will face an even higher 125 percent tariff, up from a 104 percent figure proposed yesterday. Other countries would face a universal 10 percent tariff — a meaningful fee, but far lower than the tariff that most of them had been subject to this morning.</p><p>White House officials repeatedly tried to suggest that today’s change in policy was a premeditated strategy designed to secure favorable deals. But Trump himself acknowledged that his decision was made in response to the market turmoil, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/bonds-tariffs-safe-haven.html" title="">particularly in the bond market</a>. “You have to be flexible,” the president said. “Over the last few days, it looked pretty glum.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To add to the uncertainty, the president said he might consider exempting some U.S. companies from the tariffs over the 90-day pause period. He said his thinking on the issue would be made “instinctively.”</p><p>Trump even used his social media network to encourage people to buy equities before the market surged.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The prison in El Salvador where Venezuelan migrants were sent from the U.S.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marvin Recinos/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdish special forces searching for ISIS fighters in Hasaka in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-7b00102f">The Islamic State is eyeing a return in Syria</h2><p>The Islamic State has regained strength in Syria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/syria-isis-prisoners.html" title="">where it is attracting new fighters and increasing attacks</a>, according to U.N. and U.S. officials. Any serious resurgence of the extremist group would threaten to undermine the recovery of a country still reeling after the fall of its brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad.</p><p><strong>In other news from the Middle East, </strong>an Israeli airstrike on a Gaza City neighborhood <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-strike-hamas.html" title="">killed 23 people, including eight children</a>, according to Gazan officials.

It was a step forward in our understanding of the brain, but also an indication of how much more challenging a whole brain — mouse or human — will be.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Douglas W.
