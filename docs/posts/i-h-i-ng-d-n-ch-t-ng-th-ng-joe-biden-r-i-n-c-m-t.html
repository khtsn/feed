<em>VCT 2025 will run from January through October with a reworked format</em></p>

<p>The 2025 season will begin in January with Kickoff. The new year brings a new format, as each region will seed their 12 teams directly into a double-elimination bracket, forgoing the group stage and play-in stage from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/295579/vct-kickoff-format-and-points-distribution-revealed" target="_blank">2024</a>. The top two teams from each tournament will qualify to Masters Bangkok. </p>

<p>For the regular season, Stage playoffs will expand to eight teams, compared to the six from 2024. In Stage 1, the top three teams from each region will qualify to Masters Toronto, for a total of 12 teams. Unlike this year, Stage 1 results will not affect the Stage 2 standings. Eight teams will advance to the playoffs, with the top teams qualifying directly to Champions 2025. </p>

<p>The final Champions slots from each region will be determined based on championship points, which have been reworked for 2025. Riot will confirm further details on their points system at a later date. </p>

<p>Finally, Riot will update the Classic skins for team bundles, as well as release a new capsule similar to the LOCK//IN skins from 2023. </p>
