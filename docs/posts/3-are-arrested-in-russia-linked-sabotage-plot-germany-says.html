None have been charged.</p><p>The aim, the prosecutor said in a statement, appeared to be part of a plot to damage logistical infrastructure for commercial freight. The statement did not provide further details about possible targets.</p><p>One of the men, identified only as Vladyslav T. in accordance with Germany’s strict privacy rules, posted two test packages in Cologne containing GPS transmitters in order to trace the route of the packages to Ukraine, the prosecutor said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Another man, Yevhen B., who was arrested Tuesday in Switzerland and will be extradited to Germany, directed that action, the prosecutor said. A third man, Daniil B., delivered the GPS transmitters and other items for the test packages, it said.</p><p>The authorities are treating the men as foreign agents, and believe they had been directed by Russian state actors, the prosecutor said.</p><p>Last year, a package exploded at a DHL hub at the airport in Leipzig, in what Western intelligence officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/europe/russia-plot-dhl-planes.html" title="">believe was a test run for a plot coordinated by Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU</a>. The fire in Leipzig was followed by a similar fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham, England, and at a transport company near Warsaw.</p><p>A Romanian national has since been detained by British police in connection with those fires.</p><p>Poland has also accused Russia of being behind a fire that wiped out 1,400 small businesses when a shopping mall in Warsaw was almost completely destroyed in May of last year. On Sunday, Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland accused Russia of being behind the blaze.</p><p>“We now know for sure that the great fire of the Marywilska shopping center in Warsaw was caused by arson ordered by the Russian special services,” <a href="https://x.com/donaldtusk/status/1921629800730382832" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote on X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The arrests come after several official warnings that Germany has become the target of Russian hybrid attacks.
