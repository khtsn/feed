they were “completely devastated” by the news that Liam Payne had died after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/arts/music/liam-payne-dead-one-direction.html" title="">falling from the balcony</a> of a hotel in Argentina.</p><p>“In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say,” the four former members — Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Harry Styles — said in a statement. “But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly. The memories we shared with him will be treasured forever.”</p><p>Styles, Tomlinson and Malik posted emotional tributes of their own to social media a day after Payne died.</p><p>“I am truly devastated by Liam’s passing,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBPiO3bofS4/?igsh=MnoxOWhudzN2MGxy&amp;img_index=2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Styles wrote</a>, alongside a photo of Payne from behind, looking toward a crowded arena. “His greatest joy was making other people happy, and it was an honour to be alongside him as he did it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He added: “The years we spent together will forever remain among the most cherished years of my life. I will miss him always, my lovely friend.”</p><p>Tomlinson posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBPRBySzeJW/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lengthy tribute</a> that was accompanied by a photo of Payne and him smiling together onstage. “Liam was somebody I looked up to everyday, such a positive, funny, and kind soul,” he wrote. “And for the record, Liam was in my opinion the most vital part of One Direction. His experience from a young age, his perfect pitch, his stage presence, his gift for writing. The list goes on.”</p><p>Tomlinson then addressed Payne directly, writing, “If you’re listening, I feel beyond lucky to have had you in my life, but I’m really struggling with the idea of saying goodbye.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Payne first auditioned on the British talent show “The X Factor” as a solo artist in 2008, and found success with One Direction when he returned to the program in 2010.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Atlantis The Royal</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBPVN-8vDN9/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malik shared</a> a photo of himself and Payne, both much younger and asleep in a car with Malik’s head on Payne’s lap.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Liam, I have found myself talking out loud to you, hoping you can hear me, I can’t help but think selfishly that there was so many more conversations for us to have in our lives,” Malik wrote, thanking Payne for his guidance throughout their time together.</p><p>“I knew nothing in comparison, I was a novice child with no experience, and you were already a professional,” he wrote. “There is no words that justify or explain how I feel right now other than beyond devastated.”</p><p>Payne’s family also released a statement on Thursday, asking for privacy. “We are heartbroken,” the family said. “Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul.”</p><p>Payne first auditioned on the British talent show “The X Factor” as a solo artist in 2008 and found success when he returned in 2010. Simon Cowell, the music executive and television personality, brought Payne together with Styles, Horan, Malik and Tomlinson to compete as a group, which eventually became One Direction, one of the defining boy bands of the early 2010s.</p><p>The group would release five albums and have 29 total hits on Billboard’s Hot 100. In 2015, the members <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/one-direction-says-it-is-taking-a-break-but-not-splitting-up/" title="">announced that they would take a break</a> performing as an ensemble to focus on their solo careers.

Alejandra Hernández, 21, clutched a bouquet of white flowers as she stood weeping among dozens of fans.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I grew up listening to One Direction,” she said, her voice trembling. “It meant so much to me.”</p><p>After Payne’s body was taken away in a fire truck, Mia Elsner, 18, cried inconsolably. “This tears me apart,” she said. “His music was warm and uplifting; he was different from other artists.”</p><p>Elsner said she was trying to avoid social media, where theories about Payne’s death were circulating. “I’m going to skip his songs on my playlists for a while,” she said.</p><p>Camila Martínez, 24, was working in a nearby clothing store when she heard that Payne had died. She quickly asked two friends to join her in mourning.</p><p>“He was my favorite,” Martínez said. “My heart shattered when the band split. My life was tough, and I’d turn to their music whenever I felt sad.”</p><p>“I’m still waiting to hear this is all a lie,” she added.</p><p>Some pop music stars, including Rita Ora and Charlie Puth, shared their memories of Payne on social media after his death.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I’m devastated,” Ora wrote, sharing <a href="https://x.com/RitaOra/status/1846894272345526331" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a black-and-white photo</a> of her working with Payne in which he is resting his head on her shoulder. “He had the kindest soul, I will never forget. I loved working with him so much — he was just such a joy to be around on and off stage.”</p><p>She added: “Our song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtT3qs96yb0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">For You</a> takes on a whole new meaning for me now.
