In the suit, Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, said the woman had admitted to his representatives that she had made up the story.</p><p>But in a statement, Mr. Buzbee said the suit has “no legal merit” and that the woman continues to stand by her account.</p><p>The woman originally sued Jay-Z last year, naming him as a defendant in one of the dozens of cases that have accused Sean Combs of sexual abuse. In this case, the plaintiff accused Mr. Carter and Mr. Combs of raping her when she was 13, at an after-party following the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000. After an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jay-z-rape-accuser-comes-forward-nbc-news-acknowledges-inconsistencies-rcna183435" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC News interview</a> with the plaintiff highlighted inconsistencies in her account, the plaintiff acknowledged that she had “made some mistakes” in presenting the allegations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For about two months, the plaintiff’s lawyers defended the veracity of her allegations in court papers, but last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/arts/music/jay-z-lawsuit-dismissed.html" title="">they withdrew her claim</a> with no public explanation.</p><p>In the new lawsuit, lawyers for Mr. Carter assert that the plaintiff — who is not identified — has “voluntarily admitted directly to representatives of Mr. Carter that the story brought before the world in court and on global television was just that: a false, malicious story.”</p><p>The suit quotes the woman as saying that Mr. Buzbee had “pushed” her toward “going forward with the false story against Mr. Carter.” The complaint makes no explanation of how or why the plaintiff made that admission, and it does not specify to whom.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Buzbee pushed back against the contention that the woman had recanted her account of rape.</p><p>“After speaking with Jane Doe today, it appears that the quotes attributed to her in the lawsuit are completely made up, or they spoke to someone who isn’t Jane Doe,” the statement said. “This is just another attempt to intimidate and bully this poor woman that we will deal with in due course. We won’t be bullied or intimidated by frivolous cases.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The suit ratchets up an already heated legal battle between Mr. Carter and Mr. Buzbee, a Houston lawyer who has filed more than three dozen suits against Mr. Combs. Mr. Carter already sued Mr. Buzbee in Los Angeles last year, alleging that a letter the lawyer sent outlining his client’s rape allegations and demanding a “confidential mediation” amounted to extortion. In a hearing last week, a judge indicated that he was inclined to dismiss the extortion claim but to allow a separate defamation claim to proceed. The judge has not made a formal order in the case.</p><p>In an affidavit in the Los Angeles case, which was filed on Monday, the woman said she had been approached at her home last month by two people who identified themselves as investigators working with Mr. Carter’s lawyer; she said she had refused to sign papers recanting her allegations against Mr. Carter. The affidavit said she had withdrawn her original suit because she was “frightened by the reaction of Jay-Z and his supporters, and the likelihood that I would have to be publicly named and subjected to public attacks.”</p><p>The lawsuit in Alabama brings a defamation claim against the woman, citing the NBC News interview. It accuses her and her lawyers of malicious prosecution, among other complaints.</p><p>In the NBC report, the accuser said that she had called her father after being assaulted and that he had driven to pick her up. But the father, who lived hours away in Rochester, said in the report that he did not remember doing so, noting that would have been “something that would definitely stick in my mind.” The accuser also recalled speaking to a musician at the after-party who was on tour in another state at the time.</p><p>The suit says that, as a result of the woman’s lawsuit, Mr. Carter faced reputational harm. It also says that his entertainment company, Roc Nation, lost more than $20 million, though it does not specify how.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
