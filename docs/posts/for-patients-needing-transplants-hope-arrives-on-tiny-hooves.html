They are kept under warming lights and monitored around the clock for the first days of their lives, given toys and marshmallows as treats. </p><p>But they don’t get to go outside and play in the dirt like other pigs. They are clones and constitutionally weak, genetically engineered to have kidneys, hearts and livers more compatible with the human body.</p><p>These miniature pigs are part of a bold scientific experiment that takes advantage of breakthroughs in cloning and gene editing to realize the centuries-old dream of xenotransplantation — the transfer of animal kidneys, hearts, livers and other organs into humans who need them.</p><p>Success could bring riches to the two biotech companies that are leaders in this space, the Cambridge, Mass.-based eGenesis and the Blacksburg, Va.-based Revivicor, owned by United Therapeutics Corporation. The demand for organs is huge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/00transplants-pigs-12/00pig-kidneys-01-wphv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/00transplants-pigs-12/00pig-kidneys-01-wphv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/07/multimedia/00transplants-pigs-12/00pig-kidneys-01-wphv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two adult pigs in a bright-windowed pen.

A pig’s liver could potentially serve as a bridge for those in need of a human liver.</p><p>Some scientists argue that there is a moral imperative to move forward.</p><p>“Is it ethical to let thousands of people die each year on a waiting list when we have something that could possibly save their lives?” asked Dr. David K.C. Cooper, who studies xenotransplantation at Harvard and is a consultant to eGenesis.</p><p>“I think it’s beginning to be ethically unacceptable to let people die when there’s an alternative therapy that looks pretty encouraging.”</p><p>But critics say xenotransplantation is a hubristic, pie-in-the-sky endeavor aiming to solve an organ shortage with technology when there’s a simpler solution: expanding the supply of human organs by encouraging more donation.</p><p>And xenotransplantation is freighted with unanswered questions.</p><p>Pigs can carry pathogens that can find their way to humans. If a deadly virus, for example, were to emerge in transplant patients, it could spread with catastrophic consequences.</p><p>It might be years or even decades before symptoms were observed, warned Christopher Bobier, a bioethicist from the Central Michigan University College of Medicine.</p><p>“A potential zoonotic transference could happen at any point after a transplant — in perpetuity,” he said.

Scientists edit the DNA in these cells as one might edit a manuscript: adding some genes, deleting others and altering still more.</p><p>The pigs at eGenesis have received dozens of gene edits. Revivicor produces pigs with 10 gene edits, and others with a single gene edit.</p><p>The companies clone embryos from the modified cells, implanting them in sows, where they gestate for about four months before birth.</p><p>Scientists at eGenesis first transplanted the pig kidneys into <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37821590/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">macaque monkeys</a>.

She used a kidney from a pig with six added human genes and four of its own silenced to prevent rejection.</p><p>Soon after the pig kidneys were attached to the brain-dead patients, the organs started functioning as a human’s would — making urine and clearing a waste product called creatinine from the blood.</p><p>Dr. Montgomery maintained one brain-dead patient with a pig’s kidney on a ventilator for two months.
