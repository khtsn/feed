While the court required a count of the signatures collected by unpaid volunteers, that total — 87,675 — came in short, Mr. Thurston’s office said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The majority opinion came on the day of the deadline for state officials to finalize the November ballot. Three of the seven justices — Chief Justice John Dan Kemp, along with Justices Karen R. Baker and Courtney Hudson — dissented.</p><p>Of the nearly dozen states where organizers were looking to voters to restore some abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Arkansas presented perhaps the most difficult environment.</p><p>Its deeply conservative and evangelical base of voters makes it one of the few states where a majority of voters do not support some abortion access. And anti-abortion groups, as well as allies of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, rallied in opposition to the proposed amendment.</p><p>In a bid to appeal to centrists and libertarians in the state, Arkansans for Limited Government crafted a ballot initiative that would not go as far as some other states. Current law only allows for abortions if a pregnant woman’s life is at risk due to a medical emergency; the proposal would have allowed for abortions up to 18 weeks after fertilization and additional exceptions for incest, rape and when a fetus would not survive outside of the womb.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
