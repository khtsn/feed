Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife said last week that the two “were able to work through this situation privately.”</p><p>The administration also cited a police filing from a Tennessee trooper who stopped Mr. Abrego Garcia on a highway in 2022 and raised suspicion of human trafficking. Federal law enforcement officials instructed the trooper not to detain him, and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/18/abrego-garcia-deported-tennessee-traffic-stop/83156188007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife has said</a> he routinely drove workers to their jobs.</p><p>“What Donald Trump is trying to do is change the subject,” Mr. Van Hollen said on Sunday. “Put up or shut up in court instead of litigating this through social media.”</p><p>He added, “If you have evidence, take it to the court.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, also brought Patty Morin, the mother of Rachel Morin, who was killed by an undocumented immigrant, to a press briefing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/immigrant-killing-deportations-leavitt-garcia.html" title="">lay out details about the brutal murder</a> — a case unrelated to Mr. Abrego Garcia.</p><p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/us/politics/trump-deportation-el-salvador-judge-xinis.html" title="">has described the government’s claims</a> accusing Mr. Abrego Garcia of being a member of the transnational street gang, MS-13, as “unsubstantiated” and as based on “nothing more than his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Sunday, Mr. Van Hollen expressed his sympathies toward Ms. Morin’s family while emphasizing the importance of ensuring due process for all of those in the United States.</p><p>“I’m very glad that the killer of Rachel has been convicted in a court of law — that is how we hold guilty people accountable,” Mr. Van Hollen said.</p><p>“You can crack down and hold guilty people accountable and also respect the due process rights of everybody who is in court,” he added. “I am not sure why Abrego Garcia’s rights should be denied based on an awful murder that he had absolutely nothing to do with.”</p><p>In multiple TV appearances on Sunday, Mr. Van Hollen warned that the outcome of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case could ultimately threaten the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens.</p><p>“When you trample on the constitutional rights of one man, you threaten the constitutional rights of every American,” he said. “This is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Van Hollen also responded to some Democrats who were critical of his trip and the attention Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case has generated, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who called the issue “a distraction” from economic issues such as President Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>“I think Americans are tired of elected officials or politicians putting a finger to the wind,” Mr. Van Hollen said, when asked specifically about Mr. Newsom’s comment. “Anyone who can’t stand for the constitution doesn’t deserve to lead.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Minho Kim covers breaking news and climate change for The Times.
