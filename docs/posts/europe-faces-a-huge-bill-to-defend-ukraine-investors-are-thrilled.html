The rally comes as the three-year-old war appears set to move into a new stage after an Oval Office blowup on Friday put President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on the outs with President Trump.</p><p>Shares in Europe’s defense giants — including the British defense contractor BAE Systems, the German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall and the Italian aerospace and defense specialist Leonardo — hit record highs on Monday. The sector’s surge has helped pushed the Stoxx Europe 600, a benchmark once dominated by luxury stocks, to new heights as well.</p><p>But behind the investor enthusiasm lies the question: Can Europe, facing high debt loads, chronically low growth and looming tariffs imposed by Trump, afford more military spending?</p><p>Ending the Russia-Ukraine war carries a high cost. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain rolled out a four-point plan over the weekend at a gathering of European leaders and Mr. Zelensky.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Starmer’s proposal includes an Anglo-French “coalition of the willing” to defend any eventual deal for Ukraine, which could mean “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vygkzkkrvo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boots on the ground and planes in the air</a>.” Britain also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-reinforces-support-for-ukraine-with-226-billion-loan-to-bolster-ukrainian-defence-capabilities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lent 2.26 billion pounds</a> ($2.86 billion) to Ukraine to help bolster its military forces.</p><p>Even before the summit, however, credit agencies had warned about Europe’s finances. For example, increasing the military spending of NATO members to 3 percent of their G.D.P. — which is still short of the 5 percent that Mr. Trump wants — could force European governments to make unpopular spending cuts that weaken social safety nets, <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/higher-defence-spending-will-add-to-pressure-on-europes-public-finances-25-02-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fitch Ratings has warned</a>.</p><p>Other political options include loosening fiscal rules to allow for greater defense spending, rerouting unspent <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/eu-borrower-investor-relations/nextgenerationeu_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post-pandemic recovery funds</a> to military buildup and raising taxes.</p><p>Borrowing would carry a hefty cost, too. Yields on European bonds <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/bond-yields-rise-as-defense-promises-ripple-around-world?srnd=phx-markets&amp;sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ticked higher on Monday</a>, a sign that investors were becoming worried about potential growth in public spending at a time when the region’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/europe-central-bank-interest-rates-economy.html" title="">economy</a> is slowing and its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/europe-economy-competitiveness.html" title="">competitiveness</a> is faltering. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/tougher-calls-ahead-five-questions-ecb-2025-03-03/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Analysts are divided</a> on whether such commitments could muddle the European Central Bank’s plans to cut interest rates; the central bank meets later this week.</p><p>The stakes are high. Failure to help Ukraine could eventually push European nations into accepting a deal that favors President Vladimir Putin of Russia. That could test the bloc’s cohesion, analysts say — but might be welcomed by those interested in seeing a divided Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Trump, Putin (and possibly Elon Musk?) all seem to dislike the European Union,” Holger Schmieding, an economist at the German bank Berenberg, wrote in a research note on Monday. “They would prefer to deal one-by-one with a panoply of minnows and middling countries than with a union that represents the second biggest market in the world.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Bernhard Warner is a senior editor for DealBook, a newsletter from The Times, covering business trends, the economy and the markets.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
