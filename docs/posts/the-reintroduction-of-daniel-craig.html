    <h1>The Reintroduction of Daniel Craig</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In love, it can be terrifying to show all your cards, to make yourself vulnerable, to let your desire be fully seen. What is offered to another person without reservation can also be taken without recompense. Still, because we want to be loved, we risk it.</p><p>Maybe we don’t think much about that aspect of love, preferring to dwell — as most movies do — on all the moony, swoony parts. But that dangerous feeling of exposure is the central preoccupation of the new drama “Queer,” and it can’t be explored without a lead actor who is similarly willing to offer himself up.</p><p>Enter Daniel Craig, 56, our erstwhile James Bond on a bold new assignment.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknj5_0tF2s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In “Queer,”</a> due Nov. 27 and adapted from a William S. Burroughs novel, Craig plays Lee, an American expat in midcentury Mexico City who becomes enamored with a coolly distant younger man, Allerton (Drew Starkey). Lee is undone by a desire that is reciprocated only in fits and starts, and watching Craig pine so vulnerably packs a pop-cultural punch: Once considered the very face of masculine cool, his visage is now soaked in flop sweat.</p><p>Though his performance has been earning raves and Oscar chatter since “Queer” premiered at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/movies/daniel-craig-queer-venice-film-festival.html" title="">Venice Film Festival</a> in September, it may surprise fans to see this side of Craig after watching him play a stoic secret agent for the better part of 15 years. But when I asked the director Luca Guadagnino whether “Queer” is closer to his leading man’s actual sensibility than people might have guessed, he replied, “Every movie is a documentary about the actor playing the character.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>If that’s the case, maybe now is the perfect time to be reintroduced to Daniel Craig.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/21/multimedia/daniel-craig-03-thmz/daniel-craig-03-thmz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/21/multimedia/daniel-craig-03-thmz/daniel-craig-03-thmz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/21/multimedia/daniel-craig-03-thmz/daniel-craig-03-thmz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="In a tight black-and-white close-up, Craig has a hand to his forehead while he turns an eye to the camera.

It was an early morning in October, and I had met Craig for breakfast at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood to ponder the performance of masculinity. “Most men go through life with this act that they do,” he told me. “But it is an act.”</p><p>In person, Craig is much more thoughtful than the endless grind of his James Bond press tours may have suggested: With two pairs of glasses tucked into his blue button-up and floppy blond bangs that fell frequently into his face, he had the affable air of a professor who got up early to go surfing. Self-deprecating to a fault, he apologized for being bleary-eyed. “If I’m looking a bit stoned,” he said, “I’m a little jet-lagged.”</p><p>Though Craig has a quiet focus and concentration, the only thing he treats with the utmost seriousness is his work: If everyone isn’t trying to make the best movie they can, then what’s the point? That driving force possessed him in his Bond days too: “If anything ever dipped, I was like, hang on, whoa, this is the rarest air there is in moviemaking,” he said.</p><p>That all-in attitude also has a toll. “I find it really hard, this job, and it gets harder as I get older,” he said. Though there are plenty of movie stars who reach a certain summit of success, then begin to coast, Craig doesn’t consider himself one of them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Chapeau to that — if you can do it, great, but I just can’t,” he said. “I’m not a method actor, but I’m a nightmare to be with when I’m working. I want to go home and forget it all and just be normal and be like, ‘Hey, family,’ but half my brain’s at work.”</p><p>Bond has given him the privilege to be more careful about choosing jobs, which means he is less prolific these days. “I’ve got a 6-year-old at home,” said Craig, who is married to the actress Rachel Weisz, “and I don’t want to be away from home as much as I have in the past.” When he does commit, he doesn’t take it lightly, requiring months of runway beforehand to study up.</p><p>But all that preparation can take him only so far. To ready himself for “Queer,” Craig worked over and over with an acting coach, refining his accent and poring over old footage of Burroughs for insight and inspiration into his character. Even so, he found himself succumbing to nerves on the first day of filming.</p><p>“I’ve been working on the voice and doing all these things, but still, you’re just [expletive] scared,” he said. After his very first take, Craig couldn’t keep it together anymore: “I was shaking, literally shaking. Luca came up to me and it was like he snapped his fingers: He said, ‘Just loosen it.’”</p><p>Suddenly, the carapace of the character — that fraught performance of masculinity — broke open, and Craig realized that in his quest to show Lee’s fragilities, his own had been on display instead. From that point forward, he let the tension leak out of his shoulders and tried to take a page from his director, since Guadagnino was every bit as exacting as Craig, while still able to project a more freewheeling vibe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“And you know, I’m a tight-arsed Englishman,” Craig said with a grin.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Craig with Drew Starkey in “Queer.” The main character’s sheer need brings him to his knees.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yannis Drakoulidis/A24</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>THOUGH “QUEER” MAY</strong> seem like a radical new direction for Craig, in other ways, it’s a homecoming. Before he was hired as Bond, Craig made his name in British indies like “Love Is the Devil” and “The Mother,” sexually explicit films that required him to bare both body and soul.</p><p>“He has no shame in what he’s presenting as an actor,” said Starkey, who plays his “Queer” love interest. “He finds little intricacies of humanity that we all experience but are maybe too embarrassed to show, and he will wear it on his sleeve.”</p><p>Modern sex scenes can reveal character or simply revel in beauty, but rarely do they bring the feeling of need to the fore like “Queer” does. Among acquaintances at a bar, Lee preens and holds court, but when he is in his bedroom with Allerton — or with a hired hustler played by the singer Omar Apollo — need brings this imperious man to his knees.</p><p>“Sex is surrender,” Craig said matter-of-factly. “That’s what it really boils down to, that’s where real connection is made.”</p><p>Still, his greatest fear was that without vulnerability underpinning all those sex scenes, the story could simply be reduced to “an old white guy walking around Mexico City” on the prowl for younger men, Craig said. “Of course there is lust involved — full-on, dirty lust — but it’s also someone looking for love at a time when everything must have been so complicated.”</p><p>He was just as ardent when it came to the film’s depiction of drug use since Lee, like Burroughs, has spent years addicted to heroin. “I’ve known plenty of people with drug habits, and it’s not pretty,” Craig said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>All of that comes to a climax in a sequence filmed in one unbroken, four-minute take as Lee cooks and injects heroin while alone in his apartment. Presented simply and without adornment — for Lee, this is all as routine as breathing — the moment is nevertheless heartbreaking thanks to Craig’s candor.</p><p>“I was totally certain that scene had to play in real time, without any infringement of the fiction,” said Guadagnino, who brought in an on-set consultant and former drug addict to supervise the sequence. After watching Craig’s first take, Guadagnino said a hushed “Cut” and turned to see the consultant shaking and in pain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Craig “finds little intricacies of humanity that we all experience but are maybe too embarrassed to show, and he will wear it on his sleeve,” said his co-star, Drew Starkey.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thea Traff for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“He said to me, ‘This artist is rendering the experience of my life in four minutes,’” Guadagnino recalled. “Daniel made that gentleman feel so connected, hurt and, at the same time, elated. It was one of the great moments of my life.”</p><p>To hear Craig tell it, putting anything less than his full self onscreen would have been dishonest. “I recognize the character in myself,” he said. “I recognize the pain, the longing, the yearning, the love, the difficulty and all the faults.” How does he feel at the end of a shoot like that, which asks him to bare so much?</p><p>“I usually just get sick,” he said. “Your adrenals go, they just pop.” He joked that his ego gets punctured, too: “You’re surrounded by people who were helping you out all the time, and it’s not like that at home. So you’ve got to come back to the real world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>WHEN HE WAS</strong> trying to break through as a young British actor in the 1990s, Craig found his rough-and-tumble vibe to be a poor fit with the prevailing Merchant Ivory aesthetic. “I don’t think I was very good at being posh, because you had to affect the fringe and look like you went to Eton,” he said. Brushing a hand through his newly floppy fringe in a way that suggested Hugh Grant in his prime, Craig smirked. “Maybe I could do it now,” he said.</p><p>Craig started growing his hair out for “Queer,” then let it get even longer for “Wake Up Dead Man,” the next installment of the “Knives Out” franchise. The first big peek at his new look came in July, when Craig starred in an ad campaign for the fashion label Loewe: Boyishly styled in colorful sweaters, he exuded so much floppy-haired whimsy that The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/style/daniel-craig-loewe-jonathan-anderson.html" title="">proclaimed</a> he had “killed his James Bond dead.”</p><p>All the speculation about his new look has amused him. “Someone interviewed me the other day saying, ‘How long has it taken you to think up this brand change?’” he said. Craig acknowledged, though, that it’s a hairstyle he couldn’t have cultivated until recently.</p><p>“When you’re doing a Bond movie,” he said, “the last thing you want is somebody coming in and messing with your hair when you’re hanging off something.”</p><p>Three years after the release of his final James Bond entry, “No Time to Die,” Craig said the pressures of fame had lessened, allowing him to loosen up a bit. That’s given him new perspective on just how much an artist in the spotlight can begin to withdraw from the world.</p><p>“I’ve had to examine myself a lot over the past 20 years to try and deal with it,” he said. “There was a time when I locked myself away. This is where the madness lies: You think, ‘I can’t go there because I’m so important.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He has been paying attention to the singer Chappell Roan, who has pushed back on the pernicious side of fame during her recent rise to superstardom. “I don’t care that abuse and harassment, stalking, whatever is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous,” Roan <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chappellroan/video/7404957266853645611" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on TikTok</a> in August, adding, “That does not make it OK. That doesn’t make it normal.”</p><p>Craig said, “I really admire the guts to say those things,” and explained, “Celebrity kills you. Really, it’s a terrible, terrible thing that can happen and I think you’ve got to really fight against all of the things that it throws in your face, because it’s so easy to be tempted.” Things are only getting worse, he said: “Generating and maintaining that brand is about how much exposure you have.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After Chappell Roan pushed back against the harassment of stars, Craig said, “I really admire the guts to say those things,” and explained, “Celebrity kills you.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thea Traff for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Asked whether he ever felt pressure to become more brand than actor, Craig wondered aloud, “<em>Am</em> I a brand? You have to do social media, and I can’t do that. I even regret emails I send.” Yet he conceded that if “Queer” had been offered to him 10 years ago, he would have put his loyalty to the Bond brand first.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have done it,” he said. “I was so wrapped up in Bond and what that was, I would have been terrified of doing something like this.” He knows, too, that it might have been perceived as stunt casting: “Especially early on with Bond, I was like, ‘This is enough. Stay in my lane.’”</p><p>Now, though, things are different. Has the idea of what the wider world might think of “Queer” ever entered into it for Craig?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“No,” he said.</p><p>Is it energizing not to care?</p><p>“Yes. It shouldn’t lead the way. Will the audience respond? You do have to take care of your audience in film, I think, but you can’t really be winking at them while you’re making it.”</p><p>Whether the movie shocks his fans or earns Craig his first Oscar nomination was never a top-of-mind concern, his co-star said. “You won’t be able to operate as a performer or an artist or whatever if you’re constantly thinking about that,” said Starkey, who was inspired by Craig’s daring attitude. “He’s punk rock, counterculture to the core, and that’s refreshing to see and to work with. He has nothing holding him back.”</p><p>So maybe Guadagnino was right and “Queer” is a documentary about the man who stars in it, since both the movie and its lead are inclined to lay it all on the line. Or maybe the film is a mirror, Craig suggested.</p><p>“I know lots of tough men in this world who are vulnerable,” he said, “and I like to portray that in movies. That truth is interesting to me.” Maybe watching someone like him yearn with such self-abasement can startle you into wondering whether you do, too.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Kyle Buchanan is a pop culture reporter and also serves as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-projectionist">The Projectionist</a>, the awards season columnist for The Times.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
