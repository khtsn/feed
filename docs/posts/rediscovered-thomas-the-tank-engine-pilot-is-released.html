The picture and sound were cleaned up, and newly composed music was added.</p><p>“I think there’s a sort of a lovely charm and innocence about it, and I think even as a pilot, as a test piece, it still has that lovely, classic, timeless story to it, and the voices, everything is just so delightful,” Mr. McCue said.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Thomas is a cheerful blue locomotive with an<span>  </span>expressive face who first appeared in British children’s books <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/23/nyregion/w-awdry-85-children-s-book-author-dies.html" title="">by the Rev. W. Awdry</a>. The character and his fellow locomotives, like Percy (green) and James (red), rose to new levels of popularity when they were animated for the popular program, which premiered in 1984.</p><p>The show became a favorite of children and parents alike, many of whom were drawn to its relaxed rhythms. “Children live these days in a fast-paced world, but I don’t think children really change,” the producer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/arts/britt-allcroft-thomas-tank-engine-dead.html" title="">Britt Allcroft</a>, who brought the characters to television, said in a 1995 BBC documentary. “They need in their lives gentleness, comfort.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Clips of the show were repackaged for a PBS show, “Shining Time Station,” starting in 1989. Toys, movies and a theme park followed, and humble Thomas became a billion-dollar business.</p><p>Mr. Starr was the original narrator of the series. George Carlin, Alec Baldwin, Pierce Brosnan and others followed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ringo Starr, fourth from left, was the original narrator of “Thomas &amp; Friends.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mattel</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A vast majority of the many characters were originally male — and, apparently, white. More recently, the show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/business/media/thomas-the-tank-engines-expanding-world.html" title="">made efforts to diversify</a>, adding new engines like Yong Bao of China and Ashima of India.</p><p>Loyal fans of the series of all ages <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thomasthetankengine/comments/1ki5xnf/ladies_and_gentlemen_its_happening/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were thrilled</a> by news that the pilot episode had been found, expressing eagerness to see the footage and amazement that it had been lost for so long. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thomasthetankengine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enthusiasts on Reddit</a> posted words like “finally,” “I’m so happy” and “let’s go!” punctuated by other words that Thomas and his friends would never utter.</p><p>Once the restored episode was out, the reactions veered to softer sentiments.
