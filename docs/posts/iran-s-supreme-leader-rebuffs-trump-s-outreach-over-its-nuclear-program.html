    <h1>Iran’s Supreme Leader Rebuffs Trump’s Outreach Over Its Nuclear Program</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The White House did not provide any specifics about the content of Mr. Trump’s letter, which the president said he sent on Wednesday.</p><p>Iranian officials are currently at odds over whether the country should negotiate over the program. While the ayatollah denounced Mr. Trump’s offer, other moderate and reformist leaders have spoken in favor of opening negotiations, including President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office last year. Ultimately however, Mr. Khamenei, who has long said Iran cannot trust the United States, has the final say.</p><p>The 2015 nuclear accord negotiated by President Barack Obama had been effective, officials say. Iran had shipped nearly all its nuclear fuel stockpile out of the country, and international inspectors said the Iranians were abiding by the sharp restrictions on new production of nuclear fuel.</p><p>But Mr. Trump, who had repeatedly criticized the accord, withdrew from the nuclear agreement with Iran during his first term and reimposed heavy economic sanctions on the country, gambling that Tehran would respond by pleading for a new deal more advantageous to the United States.</p><p>Iran did not come back to the table, and now the program has reached a critical juncture, experts say.</p></div></div>
