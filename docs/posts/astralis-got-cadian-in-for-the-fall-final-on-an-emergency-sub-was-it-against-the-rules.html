Days later, Mr. Olmert resigned under a cloud of corruption accusations, and the deal died.</p><p>No one in Israel today is thinking about such peace talks, amid fears that a sovereign Palestinian state would find it easier to mount another attack like the one Hamas undertook last Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and setting off the war in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Diplomacy has taken a back seat to military force, reflecting years of distrust and failed deals that have all but cemented the belief among the adversaries that neither side will negotiate in good faith. Officials and experts doubt those attitudes will be reversed any time soon.</p><p>Among the democratic nations it is widely agreed that Israel has a right to defend itself from the so-called ring of fire it faces from Iran and its proxy fighters in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen that want to destroy Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President George W.

But “there was a plan, a strategy, to finish the war in the Gaza Strip, first and foremost, and then to deal with the north.”</p><p>Diplomacy no longer seems to be a priority, she said, under the increasingly combative policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. “I think it reflects this government’s opinion and policy, generally,” Ms. Rayten Marom said. “Netanyahu, with his extremist coalition partners, chose and still are choosing this path.”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office did not respond to a request for comment this past week. On Wednesday, responding to reports in the Israeli news media, his office said it strongly denied “the claim that he has torpedoed any deal whatsoever due to political considerations.”</p><p>Nevertheless, a few hours earlier, Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, confirmed that “the center of gravity is moving north,” referring to the new focus on Hezbollah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But, he added, “We have not forgotten the hostages and we have not forgotten our missions in the south — we are committed to our duties and we are carrying them out simultaneously.”</p><p>The sophisticated attacks in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday killed Hezbollah operatives, but also several civilians, including children. The blasts wounded thousands, spreading panic across Lebanon, and prompted international concerns that Israel had risked further escalating tensions in the region. Reeling from those attacks and the strike on Friday, Hezbollah responded on Sunday with a missile barrage that went deeper into Israeli territory than most of its previous salvos.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hezbollah supporters during a funeral procession on Wednesday in Beirut for compatriots killed in the pager attacks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I consider this situation extremely worrying,” Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s top diplomat, said <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/lebanon-statement-high-representative-series-explosions-across-country_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> on Wednesday. He called on “all stakeholders to avert an all-out war, which would have heavy consequences for the entire region and beyond.”</p><p>Even Israel’s most reliable ally, the United States, sounded alarmed that negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release in Gaza — efforts it is leading, with Egypt and Qatar — would now be sidelined by the pager attacks. Negotiations were already complicated by Israel’s targeted assassinations of the top leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah and other Palestinian groups like Islamic Jihad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Anything of that nature, by definition, is probably not good in terms of achieving the result that we want, which is the cease-fire,” Secretary of State Antony J.

Another American envoy, Amos Hochstein, was in Israel on Monday to urge the government against escalating tensions with Hezbollah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Antony J.

In 2022, for example, the United States backed an agreement to allow Western companies to explore for natural gas in disputed territory between Israel and Lebanon, where Hezbollah is part of the government. And the Trump administration was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-israel-united-arab-emirates-uae.html" title="">instrumental in brokering</a> the historic Abraham Accords in 2020 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/us/politics/trump-israel-sudan-peace-accord.html" title="">normalized diplomatic relations</a> between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>But recent hopes that Saudi Arabia would finally agree to join the accords were dashed this past week when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a speech on behalf of King Salman, said anew that there would be no normal diplomatic relations with Israel until Palestine is recognized as a sovereign state.</p><p>Israel’s diplomatic contacts with adversaries are generally delivered through intermediaries, mostly Arab states in the Mideast, but also the United States and countries in Europe.</p><p>It does not negotiate directly with Hamas or Hezbollah, both of which want to eradicate Israel, and both of which Israel considers terrorist organizations, as does the United States. It also does not negotiate with Iran, which supports both groups as well as the Houthis in Yemen.</p><p>Israel and its allies say it is unrealistic and naïve to expect diplomatic efforts with groups that are trying to end its existence. “This is a different ballgame when you’re handling this situation, when you have a ring of fire — when you have Hezbollah and Houthis and Iran and Hamas, all these threats all around you,” Ms. Rayten Marom said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Elliott Abrams, an Israel expert who was deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush and is now a senior Middle East fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that attempts at diplomacy with Iran would never amount to “more than a cease-fire, as long as Iran’s ambitions don’t change — and that ambition is to destroy Israel.”</p><p>But Walid Kazziha, a retired professor of Middle East policy at the American University in Cairo, said Israel’s hallmark since its creation in 1948 has been to use military or economic means to coerce its neighbors.</p><p>“If you live by hard power alone, you die by hard power,” Mr. Kazziha said in an interview on Wednesday. “To be able to survive in this world, you’ve got to have soft power,” he said, referring to diplomacy, “so that people feel you’re useful.”</p><p>Either way, a number of officials and experts in Israel believe Hezbollah will continue its frequent strikes until the fighting ends in Gaza and Israeli hostages are freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>Even if Israel were serious about negotiations, a peace deal appears out of reach in no small part because of the, at best, <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/07/fatah-hamas-agreement-increases-chinese-influence-palestinian-affairs-road-unity-rocky" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rocky relationship</a> between Hamas in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that is led by Mr. Abbas. (A later effort during the Obama administration <a href="https://apnews.com/united-states-government-f5b86cd1848945a794e693da977bdd8d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also fell through, in 2014</a>, as did a proposal from the Trump administration, which was roundly rejected by Palestinian officials.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But Mr. Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister, said it was at least time to focus on negotiating an end to the war in Gaza and finding a compromise with Hezbollah that allows citizens to move back to their homes in northern Israel.</p><p>“We have exhausted all the benefits that we can get from a military operation, so we have to stop now and get back all the hostages” in Gaza, Mr. Olmert said. “It think it’s in the interest of Israel. We have to do it.”</p><p>“Look: I prefer negotiations every time, all the time, than fighting,” he said. “Fighting is inevitable and unavoidable. But it has to be the last resort.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
