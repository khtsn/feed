There were no immediate reports of casualties.</p><p>Israel has struck Syria more than 450 times since the collapse of the Assad regime a week ago, according to the Observatory, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-israel-turkey-us-strikes.html" title="">destroying</a> Syria’s navy and dozens of air bases, ammunition depots and other military equipment.</p><p>Israel’s military has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/israel-demilitarized-zone-syria.html" title="">seized</a> and occupied an expanse of territory in Syria over the de facto border between the two countries, including on the Syrian side of the strategic Mt. Hermon. Israel has given no timeline for its departure, apart from saying that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/12/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-syria-buffer-zone-assad" title="">stay</a> until its security demands were met.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The head of the group leading the rebel coalition that now governs Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, said in an interview on Saturday with Syria TV, a pro-opposition channel, that Israel was using pretexts to justify its “unwarranted” territorial seizures in Syria. Still, he said, Syria could not afford any further conflict.</p><p>“Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations,” he said, adding that he was focused on diplomatic solutions. “The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction.”</p><p>The Observatory reported on Sunday that Israeli forces in Syrian territory had asked residents of the countryside in western Daraa Province to surrender their weapons, as they had done in other villages in the area Israel now occupies.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military about its latest strikes in Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The strikes have hit air bases and other military equipment.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Neither the previous Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, nor the new authorities in Damascus have attacked Israel, and Arab countries and France have called on Israel to withdraw and respect Syria’s sovereignty.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israeli officials, however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/12/world/syria-news-assad-rebels/israel-syria-buffer-zone-assad?smid=url-share" title="">say</a> that the raids are necessary to secure the border and to keep Syria’s weaponry from falling into the hands of extremists while the country remains unstable. American officials have echoed those statements, with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-remarks-to-the-press-32/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> on Thursday that Israel had told the Biden administration that its presence in Syria was “a temporary move” to ensure “that this vacuum isn’t filled by something bad.”</p><p>With the Assad regime ousted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/opinion/al-assad-syria-isis.html" title="">some</a> fear a security vacuum that could allow the Islamic State or other extremist groups to exploit the situation.</p><p>The group now in power in Damascus, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has long been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other Western countries for its roots in extremist movements such as Al Qaeda.</p><p>But the group has installed a technocratic administration in Damascus and promised moderate, tolerant governance. That has led some countries to consider lifting the terrorist designation to establish relations with Syria’s new leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Visiting Israeli troops in the Golan Heights on Friday, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Israel’s military chief of staff, insisted that his country was acting to secure its frontier and its citizens even as it crossed the lines established by a cease-fire agreement between Syria and Israel in 1974.

We have no intention of managing Syria. We are unequivocally intervening in what determines the security of Israeli citizens here.”</p><p>The overnight airstrikes lasted for about eight hours, according to the Observatory, which said that weapons and ammunition depots as well as bases in the mountains and countryside outside Damascus had been struck.</p><p>It said Israel had also targeted warehouses in the countryside outside Homs, air defenses at the airport in Hama and other sites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Other foreign powers were also maneuvering to preserve their interests in the post-Assad era, including Russia, which in previous years had helped Mr. al-Assad stay in power, partly to hold onto its two military bases in Syria — springboards for its expanding military presence in Africa.</p><p>Journalists for The New York Times saw a convoy of dozens of Russian vehicles traveling west of Homs on the road to Tartus. The vehicles included fuel tankers, buses and trucks with antiaircraft guns, many with Russian flags.</p><p>Russia has not said what will happen with its forces in Syria.</p><p>While there were reports of Russian military planes leaving Syria, the Turkish defense minister, Yasar Guler, told reporters on Sunday that Russia was simply reshuffling its military assets within Syria.</p><p>“Right now, I don’t think they are going to leave,” he said in comments reported by Turkish media and confirmed by the foreign ministry. “They’ll do everything they can to stay.”</p><p>Russia was in talks with the new Syrian leadership in Damascus about its presence in the country, he added, and Turkey had offered to “provide necessary support to them in that process.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Turkey has long had tacit links with the Syrian rebels who marched on Damascus and is believed to have strong channels of communication with the group.</p><p>Mr. al-Shara, who is better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, was equivocal in his Saturday interview about Russia’s future in Syria, saying only that the relationship should be re-evaluated “in a way that serves common interests.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People walking through the souk of Old Damascus as shops began to reopen on Saturday.
