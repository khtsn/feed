Janet Mills, had previously found fault with local sheriff’s officers who allowed the gunman, Robert R. Card II, a 40-year-old Army Reserve grenade instructor, to keep his firearms despite evidence that he was dangerous. In the new report, the group emphasized the failings of Mr. Card’s Army Reserve commanders, finding that they ignored mental health clinicians who urged them to closely monitor whether he was continuing treatment and to ensure that his weapons were taken away after a brief hospitalization last summer.</p><p>The final report sharply rebuked one of the gunman’s Army Reserve supervisors, Capt. Jeremy Reamer, who, it said, “neglected to follow any of the recommendations” of the psychiatric clinician who had examined Mr. Card last summer at an Army hospital in New York after his statements and behavior raised alarms.</p><p>“In fact,” the report said of Captain Reamer, “he ignored them.”</p></div></div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/20/us/maine-shootings-final-report-document.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/e842f0806dc4ed2d/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div><div><p>On the night of Oct. 25, 2023, Mr. Card used an assault rifle to kill 18 people and wound 13 more at two popular spots in Lewiston, a bowling alley and a bar where cornhole players gathered to unwind. After a two-day manhunt for the missing gunman, he was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><p>The commission held 16 public hearings over the past 10 months. It focused on pressing law enforcement and Army officials to explain why and how their interventions fell short as Mr. Card’s paranoia and erratic behavior escalated.</p><p>Its final report said that the shootings challenged state and local law enforcement agencies in unprecedented ways, creating “utter chaos” at times in the hours after the shooting. Commissioners called for the Maine State Police to undertake a full review of its response to the shooting, “to allow for professional recommendations on improvements.”</p><p>But the commission, whose members included retired judges, a former federal prosecutor and a forensic psychologist, did not issue recommendations of its own.</p><p>“It’s a little disappointing,” Ben Gideon, a lawyer representing families of the shooting victims, said. “This is a huge opportunity, and I think it would have been well received if they had issued policy recommendations.”</p></div></div><div><p>Family members intend to file civil lawsuits in light of the “massive failures to recognize warning signs” about the gunman’s threat to the public, their lawyers said at a news conference outside Lewiston City Hall on Tuesday.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ben Gideon, a lawyer who is representing the families of those killed in the shootings, talks to reporters outside Lewiston City Hall, in Lewiston, Maine, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick Whittle/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Megan Vozzella, whose husband, Stephen Vozzella, 45, a mail carrier, was killed, said she hopes that the commission’s findings will lead to changes that will save other families from suffering.</p><p>“I lost my husband — how much more can our community deal with losses like this?” said Ms. Vozzella, who is Deaf and communicated through an interpreter at the news conference. “There are children involved who lost their parents, parents who are missing out on their children’s lives. It’s time to do some work and see how we can improve things. We are in pain, but all we can do is try to do better.”</p><p>The commission’s <a href="https://www.maine.gov/icl/sites/maine.gov.icl/files/2024-03/Commission%20Interim%20Report%203-15-24.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interim report, issued in March</a>, found that the sheriff’s department in Sagadahoc County, where Mr. Card lived, had “sufficient probable cause” to take him into custody and seize his weapons in the weeks before the shooting. The decision to instead ask the shooter’s family to take away his weapons was “an abdication of law enforcement’s responsibility,” the commission wrote in March.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The county’s own review of the sheriff’s department’s actions, <a href="https://cms8.revize.com/revize/sagadahoc/Report%20(2023-12-08%20Sagadahoc%20County%20Sheriff&#39;s%20Office)%20a.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conducted last year by a Maine attorney</a>, found otherwise, concluding that local officers did not have legal grounds to take Mr. Card into custody.</p><p>Joel Merry, the Sagadahoc County sheriff, said in an email on Tuesday that he had not had time to read the commission’s final report and could not comment until he did so.</p><p>Among those who testified before the commission were survivors of the shooting and relatives of victims, as well as members of Mr. Card’s family, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/maine-shooting-robert-card-family-testimony.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">described their repeated efforts</a> to share their fears about his state of mind with his Army Reserve superiors in the weeks leading up to the shooting.</p><p>“It’s on all of us to make sure the next time we need to get help for someone, we do better,” Cara Lamb, Mr. Card’s ex-wife, told the commission in May.</p><p>The shooting led to renewed attempts to pass more restrictive gun laws in Maine, a state with a robust hunting culture and some of the most permissive gun laws in the country. Maine lawmakers passed several new gun-control laws this year, including one requiring a waiting period for private gun sales and another revising the state’s “yellow flag” law to streamline police procedures for taking people into protective custody when they show signs of dangerousness.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Lawmakers did not vote on a proposal for a “red flag” law, which experts said would have given family members a clearer path to seek the removal of weapons from relatives exhibiting mental health distress.</p><p>An Army investigation into the shooting, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/us/maine-gunman-army-robert-card.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">released last month</a>, found that Army Reserve commanders failed to follow procedures as Mr. Card’s mental health deteriorated last summer and fall. Three Army Reserve officers have been given administrative punishments for their lapses and inaction, though their names have not been made public.</p><p>In a statement on Tuesday, Bryce Dubee, an Army spokesman, said that the Army is making changes to its <a href="https://www.usar.army.mil/PHP/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">psychological health program</a> for reservists and is “committed to reviewing the findings and implementing sound changes to prevent tragedies like this from recurring.”</p><p>The gunman’s concerning behavior in July of 2023, after he had reported for Army Reserve duty, prompted his commander to have him hospitalized at a civilian psychiatric hospital in New York. The hospital determined that Mr. Card was experiencing psychosis and homicidal thoughts and had a “hit list.” But a plan to commit him involuntarily for treatment was dropped by the hospital under what the Army report called “questionable circumstances,” and Mr. Card was released after 19 days.</p><p>The commission’s final report provided more details about his discharge. After Mr. Card announced on July 28 of last year that he intended to leave the hospital, Four Winds in Katonah, N.Y., the hospital filed a petition to commit him until it could complete a discharge treatment plan. After clinicians met with his mother on Aug. 1 and drafted a “safety plan,” the report said, the hospital withdrew its court petition, and he was released on Aug. 3.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The report also noted that a psychiatric nurse practitioner at an Army hospital in West Point, N.Y., where Mr. Card was assessed before being sent to Four Winds, did not file a petition under a New York law to initiate removal of his weapons because the clinician mistakenly believed that the law applied only to New York residents.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/us/maine-shooting-brain-injury.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">autopsy report released in March</a> detailed the findings of scientists who examined the gunman’s brain and found significant damage, similar to the trauma found in the brains of veterans exposed to weapons blasts, the researchers said.</p><p>A new report released last month by the Defense Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/military-suicide-rates-report.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">found higher suicide rates</a> among troops who are repeatedly exposed to blasts.</p><p>But the Army investigation found no link between Mr. Card’s mental health problems and his years working as a grenade instructor, when he was repeatedly exposed to explosions on the practice range. Mr. Card spent eight summers teaching cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to use heavy weapons, including machine guns and shoulder-fired anti-tank guns. By the time he turned 40, he wore hearing aids.</p><p>The chief of the Army Reserve, Lt. Gen. Jody Daniels, told reporters last month that the damage to Mr. Card’s brain could have come instead from an accident in 2008 when he fell from a roof.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jenna Russell is the lead reporter covering New England for The Times.
