That proposal included a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egypt-president-cease-fire-proposal-gaza-israel-palestine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">humanitarian aid component</a> to address severe shortages of food, medicine and critical supplies in Gaza.

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says his country must maintain control of an eight-mile-long stretch of Gaza near Egypt, known to Israelis as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-philadelphi-corridor-gaza.html" title="">the Philadelphi Corridor,</a> to ensure Hamas can no longer smuggle arms.</p></li><li><p>Hamas has rejected the scaled-down proposal that emerged from weekend <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-us-elections.html" title="">discussions in Qatar</a>, signaling that the impasse will be hard to break.</p></li><li><p>Israel also wants the option of resuming military operations in Gaza after a temporary halt in fighting; Mr. Netanyahu says Israel must wipe out Hamas as a fighting or governing force.

Hezbollah did not disarm or withdraw from southern Lebanon, and instead built up its arsenal to become the best-armed militia in the world.</p></li><li><p>The Lebanese Army is not in a position to control Hezbollah, which is a major player in Lebanon’s national government, and the U.N. peacekeepers were not empowered to do so. So it is unclear what would be needed to enable them to police a potential buffer zone in southern Lebanon.</p></li><li><p>Hezbollah has said its presence in the demilitarized zone is justified because Israel did not keep its commitment to withdraw completely from Lebanon. The United Nations assessed that Israel did withdraw. Hezbollah bases its claim on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/world/middleeast/israel-border-shepherds-spies.html" title="">land known as the Shebaa Farms</a>, which Israel contends is part of the Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 war, and not a part of Lebanon.</p></li><li><p>Israel wants any cease-fire deal to explicitly state that it can invade Lebanon again if the terms of an agreement are violated.
