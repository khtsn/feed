It makes clear that at least some Palestinians have put aside their fears about potential retribution by Hamas, which has governed Gaza with a heavy hand. </p><p>“We don’t have anything to lose,” said Mr. Masri. “We have already lost our lives, homes, and money.”</p><p>Before the 2023 attack, Hamas brutally clamped down on Palestinians protesting the miserable living conditions in Gaza and conducted reconnaissance on organizers. But during the latest protests, Hamas’s internal security forces have been largely nonexistent. Their absence, analysts said, was likely a reflection of both Hamas’s delicate position with Gazans and its reduced ability to mobilize forces under the threat of Israeli airstrikes. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest in Beit Lahia on Wednesday.

That would cause even greater anger,” noted Akram Atallah, a Palestinian analyst from the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya. Fearful that Israel could try to kill security officers, Hamas may not be able to deploy them, he added.</p><p>The first protest took place in Beit Lahia around 4 p.m. on Tuesday. The night before, community members sent around a message calling on residents to take to the streets. </p><p>“The square is calling on you,” said a screenshot of the message, shared with The New York Times. “Enough of wars. We want to live in peace.”</p><p>The message came shortly after Avichai Adraee, the Arabic-language spokesman of the Israeli military, posted an order for people to evacuate from Beit Lahia on his social media accounts. Not long after, an airstrike pounded into the town, residents said.</p><p>Nader Ibrahim<!-- --> contributed reporting to this article.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
