Since the fall this month of President Bashar al-Assad, Israeli forces have captured more territory across the de facto border with Syria in what Israeli officials have described as a temporary security measure. The Israeli presence has been viewed as provocative by the Syrian rebel alliance that ousted Mr. al-Assad and is trying to build a new government in Damascus.</p><p>Last week Israeli forces seized territory in southwest Syria that includes the summit of Mount Hermon and other locations that the Israel Defense Forces said are essential for stabilizing control of the area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu met with Israel’s defense minister, the Israeli military chief of staff and other officials “on the Hermon ridge,” according to a statement on Tuesday from his office, which did not specify the exact location of the meeting. “The prime minister reviewed the I.D.F. deployment in the area and set guidelines for the future,” it said.</p><p>Israel has given no timeline for its forces’ departure from the area and said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/12/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-syria-buffer-zone-assad" title="">they would stay</a> until its security demands were met.</p><p>At the same time, Israeli planes have conducted waves of airstrikes aimed at destroying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/10/world/syria-news-assad-rebels" title="">Syrian military assets</a>, including its navy, air force, tanks, weapons production facilities and air defense systems.</p><p>Israel’s government has argued that it is attempting to protect civilians who live in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights and to guard against any threats that could potentially emanate from Syria. Israel seized the Golan Heights during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and the area is considered illegally occupied under international law.</p><p>This week, the Israeli government also approved a plan by Mr. Netanyahu to expand settlements in the part of the Golan Heights that it controls, a move that could double the area’s population.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The leader of the rebel coalition that seized Damascus last week, Ahmed al-Shara, said on Monday that Israel’s military operation it violated a 1974 armistice agreement between the countries.</p><p>The Israeli actions have cast a spotlight on the military challenges facing Syria’s rulers as they struggle to gain territorial control in the face of outside military interests.

There has also been an upsurge in fighting in northern Syria between the Syrian National Army, which is supported by Turkey, and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.</p><p>Russia, long a major backer of Mr. al-Assad, has maintained military bases in Syria, but Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said on Monday that there had been “no final decisions” on the future of those bases.</p><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
