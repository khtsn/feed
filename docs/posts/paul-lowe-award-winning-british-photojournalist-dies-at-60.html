He was 60.</p><p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office filed one count of murder against Mr. Lowe’s son, Emir Abadzic Lowe, 19, for the death, in the San Gabriel Mountains, the county’s Sheriff’s Department said in a statement on Tuesday. The county medical examiner said Mr. Lowe had died from a stab wound in the neck.</p><p>Mr. Lowe’s work as a photojournalist encompassed several conflicts and major events, including the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Russian invasion of Grozny in Chechnya. His best known photographs emerged out of the siege of Sarajevo, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the longest sieges of a capital in modern history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In one of Mr. Lowe’s images from Sarajevo, a young girl plays in the street next to a metal tank barrier.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Lowe/VII, via Redux</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>His son Emir had long struggled with his mental health and was hospitalized on multiple occasions for psychosis over the past year, Amra Abadzic Lowe, Mr. Lowe’s wife of almost 30 years, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Their son took a trip to the United States that was supposed to last days, but he had not returned after more than two months, she said. Mr. Lowe had traveled to California to try to persuade him to come home with him.</p><p>“We were obviously very nervous about the whole situation,” Ms. Abadzic Lowe said.</p><p>Mr. Lowe and his son had been driving around the mountains in the Los Angeles area, she said, and had gotten out of their car to admire the views just before the incident occurred.</p><p>Ms. Abadzic Lowe said she had been in touch with her husband minutes before he was stabbed, and he had said their son seemed calm. But, she said, in cases of severe mental illness, “unfortunately, you don’t ever know what’s happening inside somebody’s brain.”</p><p>She added: “As a parent we felt that we could help him. We never would expect this kind of outcome.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Their son was arrested after crashing the car while driving away, the Sheriff’s Department said.</p><p>Across his career, Mr. Lowe had images published in Time, Newsweek, Life and The Sunday Times Magazine, among other publications. During the siege of Sarajevo, he photographed the daily life of the city’s residents as it was being blockaded by the Yugoslav Army and the Bosnian Serb Army from 1992 to 1996.</p><p>“During the siege, I really tried to document the lived experience of the citizens of Sarajevo,” he told the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network in 2022. “Their resilience, their creativity, their courage, their humor and their energy in the face of the incredible aggression.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Lowe captured this image of a couple kissing at their wedding in Sarajevo in 2004. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Lowe/VII, via Redux</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Lowe worked in recent years as a scholar of the history and ethics of photography at the London College of Communication at the University of the Arts London. He was also a contributing photographer and educator at the VII Foundation, which trains visual journalists from communities that are underrepresented in the media.</p><p>Christian Paul Lowe was born in London on Nov. 6, 1963, and grew up in Liverpool. He graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1986 with a bachelor’s degree in history and philosophy, according to his résumé. He earned a vocational degree in documentary photography in 1988 at the University of Wales, Newport, formerly the Gwent College of Higher Education.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He worked as a photojournalist in more than 80 countries from the 1980s to the 2000s. The first major story he covered was the fall of the Berlin Wall, he said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFGoL8-BmFU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2019 video</a> by the London College of Communication. He also covered Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, the Romanian revolution and famine in Africa.</p><p>“What I was really interested in, as a photographer, was this sense of what happens to ordinary people in these extraordinary situations,” he said. “I experienced that, I photographed that, I documented that.”</p><p>In the 1990s, he photographed the Balkan wars and the aftermath of the breakup of Yugoslavia. He cataloged his images from that period in “Bosnians,” a book published in 2005.</p><p>He met Ms. Abadzic Lowe in 1992, when she was a reporter for the Reuters news agency. They married in 1995.</p><p>For Mr. Lowe, years of working as a photojournalist raised questions about the ethics of documenting conflict and how journalists should interact with the people they cover, he said in the 2019 video. Those questions were at the center of his research in the next phase of his life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He joined the London College of Communication in 2003 as a lecturer and went on to publish several books, including “Behind the Camera” (2016), “1001 Photographs You Must See In Your Lifetime” (2017), “A Chronology of Photography” (2018) and “Photography Rules” (2020).</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An image captured by Mr. Lowe in 1994 after a Russian bombing attack in Chechnya.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Lowe/VII, via Redux</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>His books and lectures, many dealing with the history of photojournalism and the ethics of representing human suffering through images, often spoke of photography’s potential to help bear witness to atrocities.</p><p>“The camera is sort of a way of transporting you through time and place to a location that you couldn’t have been at physically,” he said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFefpNw6Wq8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2018 keynote address</a> in England.</p><p>Mr. Lowe for many years divided his time between London and Sarajevo, where Ms. Abadzic Lowe is from and a city he loved, she said. Journalists often come and go from conflict zones, Ms. Abadzic Lowe said, but in Mr. Lowe’s case “he just kind of stayed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In addition to his wife and son Emir, Mr. Lowe is survived by another son, 17.</p><p>Ms. Abadzic Lowe said he was an avid runner, a cyclist and the kind of dancer people would gather around at parties and make space for on the dance floor. “We just couldn’t compete,” she said.</p><p>Ziyah Gafic, a friend and a colleague at the VII Foundation, said his own photography career had started because of Mr. Lowe.</p><p>Mr. Gafic, who is from Sarajevo, met Mr. Lowe in 1999 as a young photographer with little money. “He gave me 10 rolls of his film,” Mr. Gafic said. With those rolls, Mr. Gafic said, he shot award-winning photos that launched his career.</p><p>They would forge a lifelong friendship. But Mr. Gafic said that even before they met in person, Mr. Lowe’s pictures from the Russian invasion of Grozny in Chechnya had made a deep impression on the young photographer.</p><p>To this day, Mr. Gafic said, “those pictures remain in my mind as classic, iconic photojournalism.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
