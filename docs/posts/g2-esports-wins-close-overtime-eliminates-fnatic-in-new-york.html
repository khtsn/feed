<p>The only map of the lower bracket semifinal was Abyss, with G2 sticking with <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> on Breach but running Tejo, Veto, and Yoru as well. FNATIC instead ran double-Duelist with Yoru and Waylay, which the team ran before in the tournament. The signature Frenzy of <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span> once again delivered G2 a pistol win, before he earned four kills to convert the bonus round as well, reaching round three with 11 kills. FNATIC had to call a timeout down 4-0, and the team won its first round just after. G2 was using the full extent of the team utility as well as keeping the confidence of jawgemo high as the team approached the half with an 8-4 lead.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/438/boaster">
		Boaster	</a>
</span> saved some of the rounds to prevent an extremely one-sided half for G2, and gave FNATIC a chance to bring the map back. FNATIC won the pistol off a strong B split through mid, but G2 stopped the bonus conversion off a great round from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2170/babybay">
		BABYBAY	</a>
</span>. The pressure was now on G2 to defend well on an attack-sided map, and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span> matched that pressure to win G2 a thrifty and regain the economic advantage and reach a 10-7 lead. That lead did not last long, as FNATIC attacked B-site a lot and tied the game at 10-10. </p>

<p>A close round was clutched by valyn, who took advantage of a body block from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/4/crashies">
		crashies	</a>
</span> on his new teammate <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/12928/veqaj">
		Veqaj	</a>
</span>. Just after, trent then fell off the map mid, and the game was tied late once again. Veqaj won a 1v1 against trent to earn FNATIC its first lead of the map, but BABYBAY won a 1v1 against <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> to take the map to overtime.</p>

<p>The first round of overtime was a big clash at A main that G2 won handily to get to map point, but FNATIC won a post-plant after to extend OT.  A chaotic G2 plant was saved by four kills from valyn, reaching match point for the second time, but this time, a smart flank from Yoru and Veto with a teleport to regroup with the rest of the G2 team won the match. The series ended as a 15-13 win for G2 Esports, taking them to the best-of-three lower bracket finals of Red Bull Home Ground 2025, while also eliminating FNATIC from the competition.</p>
