The BBC said that Mr. Norris was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx48gq0y77o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested</a> on suspicion of rape, child sex offenses, child abduction and misconduct in a public office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement that did not give any names, the Avon and Somerset Police said that a man in his 60s was arrested on Friday on suspicion of sexual offenses against a girl, rape, child abduction and misconduct in a public office. The police said he had been released on conditional bail.</p><p>“In December 2024, we received a referral from another police force relating to alleged non-recent child sex offenses having been committed against a girl,” the police statement said.</p><p>“Most of the offenses are alleged to have occurred in the 2000s, but we’re also investigating an alleged offense of rape from the 2020s,” it added. The police said that the investigation was “ongoing and at an early stage.”</p><p>The Labour Party’s move is expected to mean that Mr. Norris will, pending the investigation,<span>  </span>be effectively suspended from representing the party in the House of Commons.</p><p>Last year Mr. Norris won a seat in Parliament representing North East Somerset and Hanham, near the city of Bristol, defeating a former Conservative cabinet minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Norris is also the mayor of the West of England, responsible for the administration of several cities in a western region, a position he has held since 2021, though he is not running for re-election when that post is contested on May 1.</p><p>His political career goes back more than two decades. Mr. Norris was a lawmaker from 1997 to 2010, representing the seat of Wansdyke, in the west of England. He was an assistant whip in the government of Tony Blair from 2001 to 2003, and a junior minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2009 to 2010, under Prime Minister Gordon Brown.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Hang 10 in Hong Kong: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/asia/hong-kong-surfers.html">With the Chinese territory&#39;s unexciting waters</a>, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: </strong>A brewing shift toward religious conservatism <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/bangladesh-islam.html">has emerged from the political vacuum</a> in the country of 175 million people.</p></li><li><p><strong>Huge Tomb of Unknown Pharaoh Found: </strong>The burial chamber in Egypt <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/africa/egypt-tomb-pharaoh-abydos.html">most likely belonged to a ruler in a line of kings once lost to history</a>, researchers said.</p></li><li><p><strong>A New Sydney Beach, 50 Miles Inland: </strong>It’s no Bondi Beach, but Pondi, or Penrith Beach, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/world/australia/sydney-pondi-beach.html">has been a welcome relief for Australians</a> in the sweltering western suburbs.</p></li><li><p><strong>From Something to Fear to Badge of Honor: </strong>Once terrified of being on a list by the ousted Assad dictatorship, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/middleeast/syria-assad-regime-wanted-people.html">formerly wanted Syrians are now sharing that status proudly</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
