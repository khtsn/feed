Farther south into the Mid-Atlantic, in cities such as Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., the winter weather is more likely to fall as freezing rain, leaving a light glaze of ice across the region.</p><p>Temperatures in the Northeast should moderate, returning closer to normal. The rest of the country is expected to remain unseasonably warm. Daytime high temperatures across the Southern Plains could be 15 to 20 degrees above average, resulting in highs well into the 60s and 70s for much of Texas.</p><p>With the springlike weather, the potential for showers and thunderstorms will be present across Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri. At least some risk of hail is possible across portions of Texas, including in Austin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-12-23-xmas-week" data-id="100000009893563" data-source-id="100000009893563"><div slug="2024-12-23-xmas-week" data-sourceid="100000009893563" id="embed-id-100000009893563">
