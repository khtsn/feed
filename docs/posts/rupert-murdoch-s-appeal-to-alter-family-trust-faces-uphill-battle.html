Mr. Murdoch’s brief challenging that opinion is now due by Monday.</p><p>If Mr. Murdoch fails, and the commissioner’s recommendation is ratified by the judge, his lawyers have said Mr. Murdoch will appeal the probate court’s decision. Under the Nevada system, that appeal would be filed directly to the State Supreme Court.</p><p>To prevail, Mr. Murdoch, 93, will have to clear a high legal bar — proving that the Nevada probate commissioner’s finding of bad faith was “clearly erroneous,” according to the <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/courtrules/seconddcr.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rules</a> of the Reno-based court circuit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“These types of decisions are not that easy to challenge because of this ‘clearly erroneous’ standard,” said Kevin P. Walsh, a Nevada estate planning and litigation lawyer who appears regularly in the Reno probate court. “It would have to be something that really slaps you in the face as being a mistake.”</p><p>That might prove especially difficult, he said, because of the breadth and unequivocal language of the Dec. 7 recommendation that the probate commissioner, Edmund J. Gorman, filed under seal this month.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
