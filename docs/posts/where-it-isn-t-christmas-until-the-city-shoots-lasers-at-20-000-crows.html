There is the lighting of the pyramid of kegs at the local brewery. Productions of “A Christmas Carol” and “The Nutcracker” begin.</p><p>Then there are the tens of thousands of crows that descend on the city every day at dusk in early December, and the fireworks and lasers that are deployed to drive them away.</p><p>City officials and wildlife experts estimate upward of 20,000 crows roost downtown nightly.</p><p>“It’s like you’re in ‘The Birds,’” said Rachel Kudiba, referring to Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film about birds on a murderous rampage. Ms. Kudiba was one of four U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services specialists hired by the city to chase and haze the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/science/crows-grudges-revenge.html" title="">massive groups of crows</a>.</p><p>An outbreak of West Nile virus decimated the American crow population in the early 2000s.</p><p>But no one would know it by the sight of the cawing, swirling cloud of jet-black crows over the waterfalls of the Genesee River. They come from miles around, wildlife experts say, seeking warmth in the city’s concrete grid and ambient light after foraging in fields.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The phenomenon plays out in urban centers, with reports of large roosts wintering in upstate New York cities like Albany, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/02/science/in-upstate-new-york-a-winter-hunt-for-crows-and-west-nile.html" title="">Auburn</a>, and Poughkeepsie; in <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2013/01/26/crows-prove-far-too-cagey-to-be-thwarted-in-danville/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Danville, Ill.</a>, in the Midwest; and in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/03/crows-urban-city-habitat/677766/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Portland, Ore.</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/17/us/sunnyvale-california-crows-lasers.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">Sunnyvale, Calif.</a>, in the West.</p><p>Many cities have employed scare tactics to ward them off. But few seem as consistent in their regimen as Rochester, where the annual Yuletide ritual of shooing crows began in 2012.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rachel Kudiba, a wildlife specialist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, shoots off a flare into an area where crows are gathered</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren Petracca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For two or three nights during the season, wildlife specialists comb the city. They have been conducting annual hazing raids in Rochester long enough to have an idea of where the birds gather, and they get help from residents who, in response to city media campaigns, call the city’s 311 hotline.</p><p>When they locate a cluster, which they track by sound as much as by sight, they use a variety of techniques to rouse the crows. They shine spotlights, shoot off screaming fireworks, project laser beams onto nearby buildings and blast recordings of crows in distress. If those tactics don’t work, they clap.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The practices do not harm the crows, according to ornithologists and city officials. But that hasn’t stopped the flow of sympathy for the cagey birds on social media, like the “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/rocforcrows" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rochesterians for Crows</a>” Facebook page and a “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1hclnds/city_of_rochester_vs_the_crows/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">City of Rochester vs the Crows</a>” post on Reddit.</p><p>The crows typically decamp in boisterous groups of thousands, only to alight elsewhere in the city, commencing a game of cat-and-mouse that continues through midnight and picks up again a few hours before dawn the next day.</p><p>“It’s a vicious cycle,” Ms. Kudiba said after repelling a murder of crows outside St. Mary’s Church and nearby Washington Square Park, a favorite roosting spot.</p><p>Her partner in the operation, Daniel Hojnacki, a wildlife biologist, pointed a laser overhead from the driver’s seat of a pickup truck. Where do the birds go?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Where we can’t find them,” he said, laughing.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Daniel Hojnacki, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, uses a laser to drive away a murder of crows gathered in downtown Rochester.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren Petracca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Specialists say their goal isn’t to shoo the birds out of town altogether. That’s a fool’s errand. No laser beam can undo the winter homing pattern that has drawn these whip-smart birds to Rochester for decades.</p><p>Rather, the aim is to break up their roost into less raucous — and less messy — masses. Crows root through trash and drop their own kinds of bombs in the form of excrement.</p><p>Karen St. Aubin, the city’s director of operations, said the city spends about $9,000 a year on dispersing crows. It’s worth it, she said.</p><p>“We used to have to powerwash benches, sidewalks, statues,” Ms. St. Aubin said. “It’s really about maintenance. Some of these larger roosts are in public places and they can make them unusable.”</p><p>Kevin McGowan, who studies crows at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, said it sounded to him like Rochester’s approach was reasonable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“You can get them out of a neighborhood or away from the town hall, but you’re not going to get rid of them,” Mr. McGowan said.</p><p>“It’s an ongoing thing,” he added. “But as I tell people, just having these large aggregations someplace you can see is totally cool.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The authorities in Rochester are trying to keep large groups of crows from leaving a mess behind in downtown. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren Petracca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Criminal to Power Broker: </strong>John Chan was a Chinatown gangster before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/chan-china-nyc-influence.html">remaking himself into a powerful force in New York politics</a> — one closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Slowdown in Enforcement: </strong>For eight months, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/nyregion/new-jersey-state-police-slowdown.html">traffic enforcement on New Jersey’s highways plummeted</a>.
