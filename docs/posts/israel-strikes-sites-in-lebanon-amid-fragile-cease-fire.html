data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Israeli military said on Saturday that it had struck several Hezbollah sites in Lebanon, keeping the country on edge over a fragile cease-fire, as its forces pressed on with their campaign in Gaza with little sign of letting up.</p><p>The cease-fire in Lebanon forged this week ended months of destructive airstrikes and fighting, but it is still not clear when all of the roughly one million people displaced from their homes will be permitted to safely return. Under the deal, Israeli forces are to gradually withdraw from southern Lebanon over 60 days, as Hezbollah fighters also retreat north of the Litani River.</p><p>The Israeli military said it hit a site at the Lebanon-Syria border that was “actively being used” by Hezbollah to transport weapons to Lebanon from Syria, in what it called a violation of the cease-fire agreement.</p><p>It also said it struck three other sites in southern Lebanon where it had observed militants either “approaching Hezbollah structures,” loading vehicles with weapons or engaging in “terrorist activity” at a Hezbollah facility. It declined to provide further details about any of those strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Hezbollah did not immediately comment on the strikes. Israel struck at least two other sites that it described as Hezbollah infrastructure this week after the cease-fire went into effect on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke rising in southern Lebanon near the Israel-Lebanon border, as seen from northern Israel on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stoyan Nenov/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Despite the sporadic attacks, the cease-fire appeared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-ceasefire-hezbollah.html" title="">largely hold in Lebanon</a>. The Israeli military announced on Saturday night that it was loosening restrictions on gatherings and movement in communities near the border with Lebanon.</p><p>The move appeared to be another step toward facilitating the return of tens of thousands of Israelis who fled their homes over a year of conflict with Hezbollah.</p><p>In Gaza, however, any pause in the war <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/israel-ceasefire-hezbollah-gaza.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">feels distant</a>. </p><p>Israel is pressing a weekslong offensive in northern Gaza that has continued to isolate the area. Dozens of people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza on Friday and more were trapped under debris, according to emergency rescue workers in the territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza, an emergency response group, said it believed that more than 75 people had been killed in strikes in Beit Lahia, a farming town north of Gaza City, although it said it had been unable to reach the site because of an Israeli blockade. Civil Defense does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its death tolls, but it said that families were among the dead.</p><p>“Entire families were wiped out in northern Gaza and we don’t know anything about them,” the group said in a statement on Friday night. “There are survivors who remain under the rubble for a long time, and there is no civil defense to rescue them.”</p><p>Rescue workers have been unable to operate in northern Gaza since an Israeli offensive began almost two months ago. Internet and phone service to the area has also been unreliable in recent days, leaving rescue workers and the families of those killed and missing with few ways to obtain reliable information.</p><p>The Israeli military dismissed reports of airstrikes in Beit Lahia as “false Hamas propaganda” on Saturday, but said it was continuing its “counterterrorism activity against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.”</p><p>The military “operates following precise and credible intelligence against Hamas terrorists and terror targets, not against the civilians in Gaza,” the military said in a statement. “We emphasize that the area in question is an active war zone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Israeli military also said on Saturday that it had struck a Hamas fighter who took part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that set off the war in Gaza.</p><p>Separately, Israel on Saturday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-world-central-kitchen.html" title="">said it had killed</a> a World Central Kitchen worker it accused of taking part in that initial Hamas-led attack on Israel. It was the second Israeli strike to kill workers affiliated with the aid group.</p><p>The aid agency Save the Children said one of its workers had also been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, on Saturday, Reuters reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed vehicle following Israeli strikes east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Israel began a major military offensive in northern Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-lebanon-attacks.html" title="">in early October</a> to combat what its military describes as Hamas’s resurgence in the area. Local residents and aid groups say the humanitarian effect of the operation has been severe.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At the start of the offensive, the United Nations estimated that 400,000 people were trapped in the combat zone, and tens of thousands have fled the area since then. The fighting has also brought the flow of humanitarian aid and commerce in the north <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-us-israel.html" title="">to a near standstill</a>, leaving the civilian population with little access to food, water, medicine and other essentials.</p><p>Momen Ahmed, 27, said he spent hours fruitlessly calling his relatives and neighbors in Beit Lahia when he heard that there had been strikes nearby. “No internet or communications are there,” he said.</p><p>Finally Mr. Ahmed reached a neighbor, who he said told him that the family house had “been flattened and everyone who was inside the building when the strike took place must have been killed.”</p><p>Abu Bakr Bashir<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Israel Strikes in Lebanon Amid Fragile Cease-Fire<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
