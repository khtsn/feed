August, recorded a grisly scene: at least seven bodies lying on the road, most of them in civilian clothes.</p><p>Destroyed cars were scattered on the roadside, some with corpses in them. One man lay entangled with a red bicycle. Some bodies had decomposed so badly in the summer heat that they had to be identified by their teeth, according to a volunteer who helped recover the remains.</p><p>The video and photographs that captured the scene were taken in the early days of Ukraine’s offensive, the first invasion of Russian territory since World War II. The area was heavily contested by Russian and Ukrainian troops, with weapons fired in both directions, so it is impossible to determine who was responsible for the deaths with available information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But the Korenevo casualties represent the clearest known example of the toll on Russian civilians of Ukraine’s seizure of territory in Kursk.

Ms. Skrob described remains that had become unrecognizable in the heat and said that, overall, 15 bodies were recovered at the site, a figure that could not be independently confirmed.</p><p>She asserted in an interview that Ukrainian soldiers had shot at fleeing civilians in Korenevo, but did not cite any evidence. Residents of a nearby village, Kurilovka, also claimed Ukrainian forces had shot at fleeing civilians. Ukraine has denied the accusations, and neither claim could be independently verified.</p><p>Residents said periodic Ukrainian shelling in previous months, and a lack of warning from local officials, led many local residents to ignore the signs of approaching battle and remain home until it was too late.</p><p>A Korenevo resident named Olga said she was sitting down to a meal with her family when they heard explosions. “Korenevo descended into hell,” she said in a phone interview. “No one came to evacuate us, no one told us to leave.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As local officials fled, residents took it upon themselves to evacuate those most in need.

The Ukrainian military, in a statement, dismissed descriptions or accounts of the deaths as Russian propaganda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-10"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/17/autossell/uainrussia_Still002/uainrussia_Still002-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Ukrainian soldiers walking along a road in Plyokhovo in the Kursk region.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Ukrainian invasion creates a moral burden for the government in Kyiv, sociologists and military analysts say.
