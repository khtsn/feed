Burns, the C.I.A. director, landed in Qatar on Wednesday to try to advance a deal between Israel and Hamas to finally end the war in Gaza and free the remaining hostages held there, amid rising optimism that an agreement could be coming together after months of fruitless negotiations. </p><p>Officials from countries involved in the talks say the two sides could be nearing a truce in the war that began with the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. A senior U.S. official and another official familiar with the matter confirmed the visit by Mr. Burns, who has been the lead American negotiator, but spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomacy. </p><p>Over months of negotiations, hopes for a breakthrough have risen and fallen, each time with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for the impasse. If an agreement is reached, it would be the first pause in the fighting since November 2023, when the two sides observed a weeklong truce that saw the release of 105 hostages from Gaza and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israel.</p><p>Here’s what we know so far about the latest talks:</p><h2 id="link-64b47414">What’s on the table?</h2><p>In a change from previous negotiations, both sides have generally refrained from leaking the details of the talks to the media. Some analysts said they believed the blackout indicated that Israel and Hamas were more serious about an accord this time around.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>According to officials familiar with the talks, mediators have floated a cease-fire beginning with a 60-day truce. During this phase, Hamas would release some of the 100 or so hostages still held in Gaza — some of them dead — in exchange for Palestinians jailed in Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the so-called hostages square in Tel-Aviv, on the first anniversary of the conflict.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Qatari and Egyptian mediators, who have brokered the talks alongside the United States, hope the initial truce will continue into a permanent cease-fire.</p><p>Israel has demanded that its forces largely remain in two segments of Gaza: one, known as the Netzarim corridor, through central Gaza, splitting the northern and southern parts of the enclave; and the other, called the Philadelphi corridor, along the territory’s border with Egypt.</p><p>Hamas has previously demanded a swift and complete Israeli exit from the enclave. But the group is now willing to tolerate an extended Israeli presence in parts of those two corridors as long as Israel eventually withdraws, according to a person familiar with Hamas’s thinking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-13b2d916">Why has the war gone on so long?</h2><p>For months, Israel and Hamas were deadlocked.</p><p>Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed to eradicate Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks killed about 1,200 people in Israel, the deadliest day in the country’s history.</p><p>Hamas said it would not release any more hostages unless Israel agreed to end the war, completely withdraw its forces and release scores of Palestinians in Israeli jails.</p><p>Qatar and Egypt, as well as the Biden administration, pitched both sides on a three-phase agreement, hoping to build momentum. Those efforts repeatedly broke down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A picture taken from Israel’s southern border with the Gaza Strip shows Israeli army vehicles driving down a road inside the Palestinian territory this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Israeli critics accuse Mr. Netanyahu of putting his own political fortunes and the desires of his political allies above the fate of the hostages. His governing coalition relies on far-right parties that have opposed ending the war, hoping to control Gaza and build Jewish settlements there; they could topple the government if they reject a cease-fire the prime minister approves.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu says he is doing everything he can to free the hostages, although he has said that he will not compromise on eliminating Hamas.</p><p>Hamas has also kept fighting despite the enormously heavy price for Gazans: about 45,000 people killed and many more wounded, according to Gaza health authorities, whose figures don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Nearly two million people — the overwhelming majority of the enclave’s population — have been forced from their homes amid widespread destruction.</p><p>Some Palestinians say Hamas is now battling to salvage its own postwar rule in Gaza, rather than for any larger cause.</p><h2 id="link-49b077f0">What might have changed?</h2><p>Over the past few months, the momentum in the Middle East has radically shifted, creating what some officials and diplomats are calling favorable conditions for a deal.</p><p>In early December, President-elect Donald J. Trump vowed on social media that there would be “ALL HELL TO PAY” unless the hostages were released by his inauguration on Jan. 20. “Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit,” he wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Many in Israel saw that message as aimed at Mr. Netanyahu as well as Hamas. Mr. Trump has called on Israel to “finish up” the war, although his vision for a postwar settlement in Gaza remains unclear. The pace of talks accelerated after Steven Witkoff, whom the president-elect has named his Middle East envoy, met with Mr. Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister in November.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Moving a body from a site hit by the Israeli bombardment of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jehad Alshrafi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>U.S. officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/israel-military-gaza-war.html" title="">suggested</a> that Israel has accomplished nearly everything possible through military might in Gaza. Many Israelis are also deeply worried about the fate of the remaining hostages, whose families fear they might not survive another winter in captivity.</p><p>At the same time, many of Hamas’s leaders and fighters have been killed, and the group is more isolated than ever. Israeli officials say they hope that could push the group toward a compromise.</p><p>Hamas’s ally Hezbollah had insisted that it would keep firing rockets and drones at Israel until it ended the war in Gaza. But after Israel killed many of Hezbollah’s leaders and operatives, the Lebanese militant group buckled and consented to a separate peace last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Soon afterward, rebel forces swept into the Syrian capital of Damascus, toppling the decades-long rule of Bashar al-Assad. Mr. al-Assad was a key ally of Iran, which also backs Hamas and Hezbollah. Both groups now see their patron in retreat across the region.</p><p>Hamas’s leaders once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/sinwar-hamas-israel-hezbollah-iran.html" title="">dreamed of a regional</a> war against Israel alongside other Iran-backed militias. But they now realize that the “cavalry is not coming to the rescue,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in early December.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
