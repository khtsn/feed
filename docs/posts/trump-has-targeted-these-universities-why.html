Though the higher education industry has acknowledged shortcomings and failures, especially since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, it has warned that reducing schools’ federal funding could backfire for American society as a whole.</p><p>University leaders fear that by threatening to withhold funding, or suspending it with little or no warning, the government is trying to stamp out academic freedom, a cornerstone of the American education system.</p><p>The Trump administration has given broad reasons for the cuts, often involving claims that the schools tolerate antisemitism. But its choice of schools and even some of its demands have sometimes confused educators and experts. Northwestern University, for example, recently released a lists of steps it had taken to combat antisemitism that closely tracked with a list of demands the Trump administration gave to Columbia University. Northwestern was targeted anyway several days later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The issue is revealing the dollars-and-cents consequences of the tensions between campus leaders and the Trump administration. But the outcome of the underlying debate — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/trumps-battles-with-colleges-could-change-american-culture-for-a-generation.html" title="">the purpose of higher education</a> — could shape the country for years to come.</p><h2 id="link-5a02591d">Which schools have been targeted?</h2><p>So far, seven universities have been singled out for punitive funding cuts or have been explicitly notified that their funding is in serious jeopardy. They are:</p><ul><li><p>Brown University, which the Trump administration said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/trump-administration-brown-university-funding-pause.html" title="">stood to lose $510 million</a>.</p></li><li><p>Columbia, which is hoping to regain about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/nyregion/trump-administration-columbia-grants-cancelled-antisemitism.html" title="">$400 million in canceled grants</a> and contracts after it bowed to a list of demands from the federal government.</p></li><li><p>Cornell University, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html" title="">the target of a cut</a> of at least $1 billion.</p></li><li><p>Harvard University, which has approximately $9 billion at stake. The government has sent the university <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html" title="">a list of demands</a>.</p></li><li><p>Northwestern, which Trump administration officials said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html" title="">would be stripped of</a> $790 million.</p></li><li><p>The University of Pennsylvania, which saw <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-to-pause-175-million-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy.html" title="">$175 million in federal funding suspended</a> because of its approach to a transgender athlete’s participation in 2022.</p></li><li><p>Princeton University, which said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-federal-grants-princeton.html" title="">“dozens” of grants had been suspended</a>. The White House indicated that $210 million was at risk.</p></li></ul><p>Officials at some of the universities have been puzzled by the cuts, which they sometimes learned about through social media, and insisted that they had taken action to combat antisemitism.</p><p>Dozens of other schools are under also scrutiny, largely by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, and are aware that some of their federal funding is imperiled. But much of the focus is on 10 schools that have been identified for particular attention by a Trump administration task force that says it is devoted to rooting out antisemitism: Columbia; George Washington University; Harvard; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.</p><p>Critics of the administration have not hesitated to point out that all of those schools are in states — or, in George Washington’s case, a federal district — that voted for the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p><h2 id="link-5c4a9812">Why are the schools being criticized?</h2><p>The administration has frequently claimed that the targeted schools harbor antisemitism. When a protest movement against Israel’s war in Gaza swept college campuses from coast to coast in 2024, for example, some of the most volatile scenes were at Columbia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But the administration’s hostility toward major colleges and universities runs deeper roots than just the turmoil tied to that war. Conservatives have looked askance at the elite echelons of higher education for decades, disturbed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/us/edward-blum-affirmative-action-race.html" title="">affirmative action admissions programs</a>, high tuition costs, the views of liberal professors and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/opinion/chris-rufo-trump-anti-dei-education.html" title="">proliferation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives</a> on campuses.</p><p>Many conservatives say that their views have been marginalized in lecture halls and regard top schools as incubators of “wokeism.” They have said they want universities to emphasize academic programs that will lead students to jobs that are essential to the economy.</p><h2 id="link-3ede20ce">How much money is at stake?</h2><p>So far, the government has yanked, or threatened to yank, more than $12 billion. Most of that money is tied to Harvard and its affiliates, like its hospitals.</p><p>Universities have said little about which specific programs were in jeopardy. But Penn, for example, said that researchers in at least seven of its schools were affected.</p><p>“These contracts include research on preventing hospital-acquired infections, drug screening against deadly viruses, quantum computing, protections against chemical warfare, and student loan programs,” J. Larry Jameson, Penn’s president, said in an open letter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-549ca2a5">How have schools responded?</h2><p>Beyond statements of frustration and concern, they have generally not done much publicly.</p><p>But there is one enormous exception. In March, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">Columbia agreed to comply with demands</a> from the administration so that it could enter negotiations about the future of the $400 million that the government had struck. Some of the most important concessions the university made included agreeing to place the university’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/columbia-university-receivership-trump.html" title="">Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies Department</a> under new oversight; strengthening its campus security force; and toughening its disciplinary and protest policies.</p><p>Columbia’s capitulation alarmed higher-education leaders across the country.</p><p>“Academic freedom is a fundamental principle of universities — it has to be protected,” Christopher L. Eisgruber, Princeton University’s president, told “PBS NewsHour” in March. “And so I have concerns if universities make concessions about that. And I think that once you make concessions once, it’s hard not to make them again.”</p><p>Current and former university presidents have also said it was easy to judge a school’s actions from afar.</p><p>“I don’t want to say, if I were sitting in their shoes, that I would have made a different decision,” Mary Sue Coleman, a former president of the University of Michigan and the University of Iowa, said in an interview in March. “I don’t know.”</p><h2 id="link-78aaf326">These schools are rich. Why is the government funding them in the first place?</h2><p>Since around the time of World War II, the U.S. government has leaned on academia to conduct research projects whose findings trickle into the public and private sectors. Federally funded research has almost always had bipartisan support, though there have been occasional complaints (and sometimes outright mockery) about particular projects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In their scramble to counter the Trump administration’s recent moves, universities have tried to tell elected officials and the public that they make important contributions to the country’s health and prosperity. They have also sought to frame university-based research as imperative to the nation’s future.</p><p>“America cannot afford to pause for one second in our race with China and other competitor nations,” the board of the Association of American Universities, an industry group, said in a recent statement, adding, “Now, more than ever, we simply cannot risk impairment of the research enterprise that helped produce many of America’s greatest triumphs.”</p><h2 id="link-1b1f772d">Can’t schools just tap their endowments?</h2><p>Many big schools do indeed have big endowments. Every endowment is different, though, and university leaders note that many donors have restricted how their money can be used. Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance, have openly discussed raising the excise tax on the largest endowments.</p><p>Harvard has an endowment worth about $53 billion, far more than any other American university. But even so, a few days after the Trump administration announced its review of Harvard’s federal funding, the university announced a plan this month to issue $750 million in bonds. The proceeds would give Harvard, which has been engaged in contingency planning, some financial breathing room.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Blinder is a national correspondent for The Times, covering education.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/harvard-university">Harvard University</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/university-of-pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/brown-university">Brown University</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html">321</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html">321</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Law Firms’ No-Win Situation:</strong> If they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-law-firms-orders.html">resist President Trump’s pressure</a>, the firms jeopardize their bottom line, exposing themselves to executive orders that imperil their businesses.
