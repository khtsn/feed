But “soon” appears to be real this time.</p><p>As of <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">May 7</a>, a standard driver’s license or state ID will no longer pass muster at airport security checkpoints, the Department of Homeland Security says. Passengers will instead need to present a security-enhanced, star-emblazoned Real ID or another approved form of identification like a passport.</p><p>The change, nearly 20 years in the making, is meant to enhance security by setting a more consistent standard for state-issued documentation, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Department of Homeland Security</a>.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about the coming deadline.</p><h2 id="link-762b39cb">What is a Real ID?</h2><p>A Real ID is a federally compliant state-issued driver’s license, learner’s permit or nondriver ID. Real IDs are marked with a star — generally gold or black — and vary in appearance by state or territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Any resident of a U.S. state or territory who wishes to use a driver’s license or nondriver ID at a T.S.A. checkpoint must make sure that it is Real ID-compliant. Driver’s licenses that do not have the star are not Real IDs. Some noncompliant IDs will also have the words “Federal limits apply.”</p><p>The percentage of Americans who have updated their driver’s licenses to be Real ID compliant appears to vary widely by state. For example, in Pennsylvania, where there have been <a href="https://6abc.com/post/people-wait-line-hours-get-real-id-penndot-center-king-prussia-pennsylvania/16023685/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports of long lines</a> at license offices, it is a little more than 26 percent, the state’s Transportation Department said. In California, it is just over 55 percent.</p><h2 id="link-24ddfe3f">Why is the government requiring Real IDs?</h2><p>The hijackers responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were carrying U.S. driver’s licenses and state IDs. In the aftermath, the government pushed to tighten national standards for state-issued documentation, and in 2005, Congress passed <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Real ID Act.</a></p><p>The act sets minimum standards for licenses and other types of identification cards. Enforcement of the Real ID Act was initially set to begin in 2008, but it has been repeatedly delayed for numerous reasons, including the Covid-19 pandemic and opposition from <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/why-some-states-wont-comply-with-real-id-requirements" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">states concerned about privacy</a>.</p><h2 id="link-113db39e">Do Real IDs take the place of passports?</h2><p>Real IDs will get you on domestic flights, but they will not let you cross international borders, including those with Canada and Mexico. They can’t be used for international cruises, either. You will still almost always need a passport for such trips.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>However, a handful of states — Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Washington and Vermont — offer <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/enhanced-drivers-licenses-what-are-they" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enhanced driver’s licenses</a>, which travelers can use to cross land and sea borders to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean without a passport.</p><p>Enhanced licenses are Real ID-compliant, although they display an American flag instead of a star. The flag’s location on the card varies by state.</p><p>Enhanced licenses can’t be used in lieu of a passport if you’re traveling internationally by air, and only U.S. citizens can get them. The cost varies by state. In Minnesota, for example, it’s an additional $15; in New York, it’s $30 more.</p><h2 id="link-42b2f7d6">Are there other IDs you can use at the airport?</h2><p>The T.S.A. also accepts certain <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other forms of identification</a> at airport security checkpoints. These include valid passports, permanent resident cards (also known as a green cards) and cards for trusted traveler programs like <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Entry</a> and <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NEXUS</a>, which allows prescreened travelers to transit quickly across the United States-Canada border.</p><p>About 48 percent of Americans have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/travel/passports-real-id-travelers.html" title="">passports</a>, <a href="https://2021-2025.state.gov/expanding-passport-agencies-across-the-united-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the U.S. State Department</a>.</p><h2 id="link-5619a570">How do you get a Real ID?</h2><p>To apply for a Real ID, you’ll generally need to provide a Social Security number or <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/driver-license/applying-for-a-standard-license-without-a-social-security-number-or-ineligibility" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proof of ineligibility</a>, corroborate your address through documents like utility bills or bank statements, and verify your identity and lawful status through a handful of additional documents, including a birth certificate or a passport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Check <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">your state’s driver’s licensing agency website</a> to find out how to apply and learn more about the specific documentation you’ll need.</p><p>Getting a Real ID most likely involves making an in-person appointment, which might take a while. There are <a href="https://6abc.com/post/people-wait-line-hours-get-real-id-penndot-center-king-prussia-pennsylvania/16023685/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports of long lines</a> at licensing offices across states, including Pennsylvania and <a href="https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/kentucky-real-id-deadline-kytc-regional-licensing-offices/417-a16e0c2f-98e6-41e0-9b19-dd20b01c4f86" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kentucky</a>. New York is <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/news/nys-dmv-introduces-real-id-thursdays-extended-office-hours-on-thursdays-for-real-id-processing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extending service hours at select offices</a> and boosting the number of appointments to meet demand.</p><p>In many states, including South Carolina and New York, there is no additional cost to receive a Real ID if you’re already renewing your license. But some states charge extra. Pennsylvania, for example, <a href="https://www.pa.gov/services/dmv/apply-for-real-id.html#:~:text=Online,$39.50%20standard%20license%20renewal%20fee)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charges a one-time $30 fee</a> in addition to the cost of renewal, the first time you upgrade to Real ID.</p><h2 id="link-2adec479">Do children and teenagers need Real IDs?</h2><p>The T.S.A. doesn’t require those under 18 to show <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identification for domestic travel</a>. Individual airlines have their own policies about what types of ID minors are required to carry.</p><p>For international travel, children of all ages are required to carry passports.</p><h2 id="link-14d77b1e">Are fliers without Real IDs really going to get turned away?</h2><p>The Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warns on its website</a> that travelers will need to be in compliance as of May 7.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the T.S.A. has general guidance that passengers who don’t bring accepted forms of identification to the airport <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may still be allowed to fly</a>, after an additional identity verification. If you’re in doubt, your passport will get you on a plane, whether it’s a domestic or an international flight.</p><p>Late last year, the T.S.A. <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/09/12/2024-20616/minimum-standards-for-drivers-licenses-and-identification-cards-acceptable-by-federal-agencies-for" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed a rule</a> to allow for a phased two-year transition to full enforcement of Real ID, citing delays in making state IDs compliant with the rules.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
