But on <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">May 7</a>, Real ID is set to become reality.</p><p>Starting then, a standard driver’s license or state ID will no longer pass muster at airport security checkpoints, the Department of Homeland Security says. Passengers will instead need to present a security-enhanced, star-emblazoned Real ID or another approved form of identification like a passport.</p><p>The change, nearly 20 years in the making, is meant to enhance security by setting a more consistent standard for state-issued documentation, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Department of Homeland Security</a>.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know as the Real ID deadline nears.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-762b39cb">What is a Real ID?</h2><p>A Real ID is a federally compliant state-issued driver’s license, learner’s permit or nondriver ID. Real IDs are marked with a star — generally gold or black — and vary in appearance by state or territory.</p><p>Any resident of a U.S. state or territory who wishes to use a driver’s license or nondriver ID at a T.S.A. checkpoint must make sure that it is Real ID-compliant. Driver’s licenses that do not have the star are not Real IDs. Some noncompliant IDs will also have the words “Federal limits apply.”</p><p>The percentage of Americans who have updated their driver’s licenses to be Real ID compliant appears to vary widely by state. For example, in Pennsylvania, where there have been <a href="https://6abc.com/post/people-wait-line-hours-get-real-id-penndot-center-king-prussia-pennsylvania/16023685/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports of long lines</a> at license offices, it was little more than 26 percent by mid-April, the state’s Transportation Department said. In California, it was just over 55 percent.</p><h2 id="link-24ddfe3f">Why is the government requiring Real IDs?</h2><p>The hijackers responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were carrying U.S. driver’s licenses and state IDs. In the aftermath, the government pushed to tighten national standards for state-issued documentation, and in 2005, Congress passed <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Real ID Act.</a></p><p>The act sets minimum standards for licenses and other types of identification cards. Enforcement of the Real ID Act was initially set to begin in 2008, but it has been repeatedly delayed for numerous reasons, including the Covid-19 pandemic and opposition from <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/why-some-states-wont-comply-with-real-id-requirements" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">states concerned about privacy</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-113db39e">Do Real IDs take the place of passports?</h2><p>No. Regular Real IDs will get you on domestic flights, but they will not let you cross international borders, including those with Canada and Mexico. They can’t be used for international cruises, either. You will still almost always need a passport for such trips.</p><p>However, a passport will get you on a plane, whether it’s a domestic or an international flight. About 48 percent of Americans have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/travel/passports-real-id-travelers.html" title="">passports</a>, <a href="https://2021-2025.state.gov/expanding-passport-agencies-across-the-united-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the U.S. State Department</a>.</p><h2 id="link-431080cf">What’s an enhanced driver’s license?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Real ID-compliant driver’s license has a star on it.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">T.S.A.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An enhanced driver’s license, which complies with Real ID requirements and may be used to board domestic flights, also allows travelers to cross land and sea borders to Mexico, Canada, Bermuda and the Caribbean.

These licenses, which comply with Real ID requirements to board domestic flights, also allow travelers to cross land and sea borders to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean without a passport.</p><p>Enhanced licenses display an American flag instead of a star. The flag’s location on the card varies by state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Enhanced licenses can’t be used in lieu of a passport if you’re traveling internationally by air, and only U.S. citizens can get them. The cost varies by state. In Minnesota, for example, it’s an additional $15; in New York, it’s $30 more.</p><h2 id="link-42b2f7d6">Are there other IDs you can use at the airport?</h2><p>The T.S.A. also accepts certain <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other forms of identification</a> at airport security checkpoints. These include valid passports, passport cards, permanent resident cards (also known as green cards) and cards for trusted traveler programs like <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Entry</a> and <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NEXUS</a>, which allows prescreened travelers to transit quickly across the United States-Canada border.</p><h2 id="link-5619a570">How do you get a Real ID?</h2><p>To apply for a Real ID, you’ll generally need to provide a Social Security number or <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/driver-license/applying-for-a-standard-license-without-a-social-security-number-or-ineligibility" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proof of ineligibility</a>, corroborate your address through documents like utility bills or bank statements, and verify your identity and lawful status through a handful of additional documents, including a birth certificate or a passport.</p><p>Check <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">your state’s driver’s licensing agency website</a> to find out how to apply and learn more about the specific documentation you’ll need.</p><p>Getting a Real ID most likely involves making an in-person appointment, which might take a while. There are <a href="https://6abc.com/post/people-wait-line-hours-get-real-id-penndot-center-king-prussia-pennsylvania/16023685/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports of long lines</a> at licensing offices across states, including Pennsylvania and <a href="https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/kentucky-real-id-deadline-kytc-regional-licensing-offices/417-a16e0c2f-98e6-41e0-9b19-dd20b01c4f86" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kentucky</a>. New York is <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/news/nys-dmv-introduces-real-id-thursdays-extended-office-hours-on-thursdays-for-real-id-processing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extending service hours at select offices</a> and boosting the number of appointments to meet demand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In many states, including South Carolina and New York, there is no additional cost to receive a Real ID if you’re already renewing your license. But some states charge extra. Pennsylvania, for example, <a href="https://www.pa.gov/services/dmv/apply-for-real-id.html#:~:text=Online,$39.50%20standard%20license%20renewal%20fee)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charges a one-time $30 fee</a> in addition to the cost of renewal, the first time you upgrade to Real ID.</p><h2 id="link-2adec479">Do children and teenagers need Real IDs?</h2><p>The T.S.A. doesn’t require those under 18 to show <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identification for domestic travel</a>. Individual airlines have their own policies about what types of ID minors are required to carry.</p><p>For international travel, children of all ages are required to carry passports.</p><h2 id="link-14d77b1e">Are fliers without Real IDs really going to get turned away?</h2><p>Not necessarily, but they may face holdups.</p><p>This year, the T.S.A. <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2025/01/13/tsa-publishes-final-rule-real-id-enforcement-beginning-may-7-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a final rule</a> allowing a phased two-year transition to full enforcement of Real ID, citing delays in making state IDs compliant with the rules. However, a T.S.A. spokesperson said in mid-April that the agency had decided that the phased approach was not necessary and that full enforcement would begin on May 7.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Still, the T.S.A. continues to have general guidance on its website that passengers who don’t bring accepted forms of identification to the airport <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may still be allowed to fly</a>, after an additional identity verification, which “includes collecting information such as your name and current address,” according to the T.S.A. website.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christine Chung is a Times reporter covering airlines and consumer travel.</p></div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Open Up Your World</h2><h3>Considering a trip, or just some armchair traveling?
