<p>The three-map series was played out on TALON&#39;s Fracture, T1&#39;s Bind, and the decider map of Haven. </p>

<p>While Fracture has generally been an attack-sided map globally, it has been more balanced across the Pacific Region. In five maps and 103 rounds of Fracture played throughout <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a>, the rounds have been split 53 to 50, with teams winning three more attack-sided rounds.</p>

<p>T1 opted to begin the map on defense, and made a statement, displaying excellent control of the map to enter halftime with a 10-2 advantage. TALON proved to be too predictable on attack, with the T1 defenders easily taking care of business and only giving up five first deaths.</p>

<p><em>The cherry on top for TALON.</em></p>
