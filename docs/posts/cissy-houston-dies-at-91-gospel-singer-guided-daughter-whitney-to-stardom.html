She was 91.</p><p>Her daughter in-law Pat Houston confirmed the death, in hospice care, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Houston was being treated for Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>Ms. Houston was a gifted stylist whose powerful voice and deep faith made her an influential figure in gospel circles for decades. She won Grammy Awards in the traditional soul gospel category for the albums “Face to Face” in 1997 and “He Leadeth Me” in 1999.</p><p>Before then, she had been among the busiest backup singers in the record business, providing vocal support for Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley and many others. And for more than a half-century she was the choir director for the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, where she got her start as a singer in the 1930s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Houston was the matriarch of a singing dynasty that included her daughter, her nieces Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick and a cousin, the opera star Leontyne Price. She endured the deaths of her daughter, who drowned in a hotel bathtub in 2012, and of Whitney Houston’s daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown, who, in an eerily similar tragedy, was found unresponsive in a bathtub in her Georgia home in January 2015 and died six months later. Whitney Houston had struggled with addiction for many years despite her mother’s intervention.</p><p>Unlike her daughter, Cissy Houston achieved wider fame in her later years, but she was comfortable with that. As she told Jet magazine in 1998: “A lot of the things I’ve done have come late in life, and it’s like a whole new career starting up. I don’t have regrets about the way I planned and lived my life, and I am very proud of what I’ve become.”</p><p>On her own or with her group the Sweet Inspirations, Ms. Houston can be heard singing backup on such hits as Ms. Franklin’s “(You Make Me Feel Like) a Natural Woman,” Van Morrison’s “Brown-Eyed Girl” and Dionne Warwick’s “Walk On By.”</p><p>She was pregnant with her daughter while recording backup vocals for the Drifters’ “On Broadway” in 1963, according to her autobiography, “How Sweet the Sound: My Life With God and Gospel” (1998), written with Jonathan Singer.</p><p>“This was bound to be an interesting child,” she wrote.</p><p>Robert Darden, a professor of journalism at Baylor University and the author of several books on gospel music, said Ms. Houston was “a significant figure not because she sold a lot of records, but because of the people she influenced who did sell a lot and because of her work as a sustainer and nurturer of the gospel music tradition.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Whitney Houston was trained by the best,” he continued, in an interview for this obituary in 2015, “and though she had a once-in-a-lifetime voice, without the training and influence and experience of someone like Cissy, who knew everybody and who could sing in any style, she would not have achieved what she did.”</p><p>Cissy Houston was born Emily Drinkard in Newark on Sept. 30, 1933, the last of eight children of Nicholas Drinkard, a factory worker, and Delia Mae (McCaskill) Drinkard. Her family attended revival-style weekday services, where they first encountered gospel music.</p><p>Cissy began singing, along with her siblings, at age 5 in local churches, and she, her sister Anne and her brothers Larry and Nicky formed the Drinkard Four, a quartet that performed regularly at the New Hope Baptist Church. The group, renamed the Drinkard Singers, was featured in a Carnegie Hall performance in 1951 that starred Mahalia Jackson.</p><p>Ms. Houston’s marriage to Freddie Garland in 1955 ended in divorce. She later married John Houston, with whom she had three children. </p><p><em>A complete obituary will appear soon.</em></p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
