The benchmark index in Germany, whose export-driven economy is exposed to global tensions, dropped more than 1 percent.</p><p>U.S. stocks were set to open about half a percent lower at the end of a volatile week, in which indexes around the world swung dramatically between large gains and losses amid the turmoil and confusion caused by President Trump’s pronouncements on tariffs.</p><p>Beijing’s tariff retaliation came after markets closed in Asia. During Friday’s trading session, stocks in Hong Kong rose 1.6 percent, stocks in mainland China rose 0.4 percent and in Taiwan by 2.8 percent. But Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 2.9 percent, catching up to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/stock-market-tariffs.html" title="">decline on Wall Street the day before</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>All week, markets have been whipped around by the varying intensity and focus of Mr. Trump’s trade policy. Steep “reciprocal tariffs” were imposed on dozens of countries and then, hours later, paused for 90 days. At the same time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/us-china-tariffs-trade-war.html" title="">Washington and Beijing ratcheted up tariffs on goods traded between the countries</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 index slumped 3.5 percent after the Trump administration clarified that tariffs on Chinese imports were a total of 145 percent, not 125 percent as it had said they day before.</p><p>On typical trading days, stock indexes post modest gains or losses but over the past week, the S&amp;P 500 index has suffered some of its steepest declines as well as its biggest one-day gain since the 2000s.</p><p>This week, the VIX volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose to levels last seen during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.</p><p>The turmoil has extended into a wide range of assets. U.S. Treasuries, which tend to be considered a haven in times of turmoil, have lost value, which has pushed yields higher. A bond sell-off happening at the same time as declines in stocks and the U.S. dollar, has puzzled traders and analysts. Some speculation has focused on whether heavy losses in the stock market have led investors to sell their bond holdings or whether a foreign central bank is selling U.S. assets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Friday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was above 4.4 percent, the highest since February.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
