Others had bullets in the head, execution style. In killing after killing, the police would only describe the victims as “drug suspects” who had resisted arrest, a charge that rarely stood up to even minor scrutiny. And yet the slaughter continued with impunity, at the behest of the man who was elected president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.</p><p>But on Tuesday, nearly three years after Mr. Duterte left office, a major step was taken toward accountability for thousands of Filipinos who have long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/asia/philippines-drug-war-duterte-justice.html" title="">sought justice</a> for their loved ones. Acting on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, which had been investigating Mr. Duterte’s antidrug campaign, the Philippine authorities arrested Mr. Duterte at Manila’s main airport as he returned from a trip to Hong Kong. On Tuesday night, he was flown out on a plane that was bound for The Hague, where the court is based, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>The I.C.C. accused Mr. Duterte, 79, of crimes against humanity during his time as president and when he was the mayor of the city of Davao. His case will be a high-profile test of the court, which in recent months has sought the arrest of Israel’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/icc-netanyahu-israel-gaza-war.html" title="">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, and the head of the military junta in Myanmar, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/asia/myanmar-junta-leader-rohingya.html" title="">Min Aung Hlaing</a>, on the same charges as Mr. Duterte. But those orders are unlikely to come to fruition, much like the court’s warrant for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/world/europe/putin-icc-arrest-warrant-war-crimes.html" title="">issued two years ago</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11int-duterte-arrest-01-wvkf/11int-duterte-arrest-01-wvkf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11int-duterte-arrest-01-wvkf/11int-duterte-arrest-01-wvkf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/11int-duterte-arrest-01-wvkf/11int-duterte-arrest-01-wvkf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A body lying face down in an alley on a night when it was pouring rain.

But in the warrant, a three-judge panel wrote that it was investigating killings during the time the Philippines was still a member of the court. And the nation remains a member of Interpol, which can seek arrests on behalf of the I.C.C. A representative of Interpol was present when Mr. Duterte was arrested.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Duterte’s arrest pierced the culture of impunity he had built around his so-called death squads. Even after his single, six-year term ended, he seemed to be above justice. His successor, Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., rose to the presidency after forming a political alliance with Mr. Duterte’s daughter, Sara, who became vice president. Early in his administration, Mr. Marcos indicated that he would not cooperate with the I.C.C.</p><p>But ties between Mr. Marcos and Ms. Duterte unraveled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/asia/duterte-marcos-philippines-feud.html" title="">quickly and in spectacular fashion</a>. By late 2023, Mr. Marcos’s government had quietly allowed I.C.C. investigators to enter the Philippines.</p><p>Harry Roque, Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, said his lawyers were scrambling to file a petition in court for his release.</p><p>In a statement, Ms. Duterte said her father was “being forcibly taken to The Hague.” She added, “This is not justice — this is oppression and persecution.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Before he was elected in 2016, Mr. Duterte announced that he would crack down on drugs and that the country’s “drug pushers, holdup men and do-nothings” had better leave because he would “kill” them. Rights groups say roughly 30,000 ended up dying in his war on drugs.</p><p>Soon after Mr. Duterte was inaugurated, a group of policemen barged into Mary Ann Domingo’s tiny apartment, killing her partner and son. Last June, in a rare conviction, a judge ruled that the four police officers who participated in the operation were guilty of homicide. But they still have not been imprisoned.</p><p>“I don’t feel any sense of justice,” Ms. Domingo said. “Duterte has no remorse.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Even as he took responsibility for the carnage, Mr. Duterte seemed untouchable, until Tuesday.

As mayor of Davao, the second-largest city in the Philippines, for more than two decades, he ran a deadly antidrug crackdown with impunity. In 2016, he parlayed his law-and-order credentials into a victory in the presidential election, even though experts said the country did not have an outsized problem with drugs.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Even as they continued to mourn their relatives, many Filipinos could not imagine a day when Mr. Duterte would be in custody. On Friday, Mr. Duterte embarked on what appeared to be a sudden trip to Hong Kong.
