Activists say the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/world/asia/philippines-duterte-drug-war.html" title="">vast majority of victims</a> were poor, urban Filipinos, some of whom were minors and people who had nothing to do with the drug trade.</p><p>Only a handful of people have been convicted in connection with the killings, which rights groups say totaled roughly 30,000.</p><p>“I am very happy that Duterte has been arrested so we can finally have justice,” said Cristina Jumola, whose three sons were killed during the drug war. “We waited so long for this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Tuesday afternoon, it appeared that the Philippine government was prepared to surrender Mr. Duterte — who was being held at Villamor Air Base in Manila — to the I.C.C. An official familiar with the proceedings said a plane was ready to take Mr. Duterte to The Hague, where the court is based. But Harry Roque, Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, said his lawyers were scrambling to file a petition in court for Mr. Duterte’s release.</p><p>The case will be a high-profile test of the court, which in recent months has sought the arrest of Israel’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/icc-netanyahu-israel-gaza-war.html" title="">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, and the head of the military junta in Myanmar, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/asia/myanmar-junta-leader-rohingya.html" title="">Min Aung Hlaing</a>, accusing both men of crimes against humanity.</p><p>Minutes before he was arrested, Mr. Duterte was characteristically defiant.</p><p>“You would have to kill me first, if you are going to ally with white foreigners,” Mr. Duterte said as he was getting off the plane from Hong Kong, according to <a href="https://x.com/gmanews/status/1899289498485486054" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video posted by GMA News</a>, a Philippine broadcaster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Duterte in custody at Villamor Air Base in Manila, according to his political party, which released this photo. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Partido Demokratiko PilipinoLakas ng Bayan, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>For years, Mr. Duterte seemed untouchable. As mayor of Davao, the second-largest city in the Philippines, for more than two decades, he ran a deadly antidrug crackdown with impunity. In 2016, he parlayed his law-and-order credentials into a victory in the presidential election, even though experts said the country did not have an outsized problem with drugs.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At his final campaign rally that year, Mr. Duterte told the crowd to “forget the laws on human rights.”</p><p>“You drug pushers, holdup men and do-nothings, you better go out,” he said. “Because I’ll kill you.” He said he would give himself and his security forces immunity from prosecution and pardon himself “for the crime of multiple murder.”</p><p>While in office, Mr. Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the I.C.C., which had begun looking into the extrajudicial killings.</p><p>Mr. Panelo, Mr. Duterte’s lawyer, said the arrest was unlawful in part because the Philippine police had not allowed the former president’s attorneys to meet him at the airport. He said he planned to bring criminal complaints against the police and the officials who ordered the arrest.</p><p>He added that the arrest was illegal because the arrest warrant “comes from a spurious source, the I.C.C., which has no jurisdiction over the Philippines.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But in the warrant, the I.C.C. panel of judges wrote that the court still had jurisdiction in the matter because its inquiry was focused on killings that occurred while the Philippines was still a member of the court. The nation remains a member of Interpol, which can seek the arrest of Mr. Duterte on behalf of the I.C.C. A representative of Interpol was present when Mr. Duterte was arrested. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers outside Villamor Air Base on Tuesday.

Marcos Jr. The son of the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, he rose to the presidency after forming a political alliance with Mr. Duterte’s daughter Sara, who was elected as his vice president. Early in his administration, Mr. Marcos indicated that he would not cooperate with the I.C.C.</p><p>But ties between Mr. Marcos and Ms. Duterte unraveled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/asia/duterte-marcos-philippines-feud.html" title="">quickly and in spectacular fashion</a>. By late 2023, Mr. Marcos’s government had quietly allowed I.C.C. investigators to enter the Philippines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Last year, the Philippines’ House of Representatives started an inquiry into Mr. Duterte’s drug war.

I should be the one jailed, not the policemen who obeyed my orders. It’s pitiful, they are just doing their jobs.”</p><p>Marlise Simons<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee">More about Sui-Lee Wee</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/rodrigo-duterte">Rodrigo Duterte</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A New Chinese Embassy: </strong>Britain appears ready to approve what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/europe/china-embassy-britain.html">would be the largest diplomatic outpost in Europe</a>, but neighbors and activists in London fear tapped phone lines and suppressed protests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greenland’s Big Moment:</strong> Ignored for most of its existence, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/europe/greenland-trump-denmark.html">the huge ice-bound island has been thrust into a geopolitical maelstrom</a>.
