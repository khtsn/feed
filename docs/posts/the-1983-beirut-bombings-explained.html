The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said that a second top commander was among those killed and the death toll rose significantly.</p><p>Lebanon’s health minister, Firas Abiad, said the number of people killed in the Friday strike had risen to at least 37, including three children and seven women. At least 68 more people were wounded, he said.</p><div><p>Hezbollah released a list of names of members who had been killed, including the leader of its elite Radwan force, Ahmed Wahbi. A day earlier, Hezbollah confirmed the death of the founder of the force, Ibrahim Aqeel, who had been overseeing its operations against Israel. He was long wanted by the United States for his role in two bombing attacks in 1983 that killed more than 350 people at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine Corps barracks.</p><p>The airstrike was the latest in a string of apparent Israeli attacks against the Iran-backed group this week, operations that have yet again stoked the risk of escalation. The region is <a href="#israel-hezbollah-lebanon" title="">awaiting signs of how Hezbollah</a>, Iran’s most important regional ally, might respond.</p><p>The strike leveled two high-rise apartment buildings in a southern suburb of Beirut where the Lebanese militia holds sway. On Saturday, rescuers brought in more heavy vehicles in an effort to find those thought to be missing beneath the rubble.</p><p>Israel has been signaling for days that it planned to shift some of its military focus north toward Hezbollah in Lebanon and away from the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire across the Lebanon-Israel border since the beginning of the war, and tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the intensifying exchange.</p><p>Here’s what else you should know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Device attacks:</strong> The airstrike followed quickly on the heels of two days of chaos across Lebanon, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" title="">pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members exploded en masse</a>. Hospitals were filled with thousands of wounded, many missing eyes or fingers, and a sense of anger and panic has spread across the country. At least 37 people were killed in those operations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Calls to investigate:</strong> Members of the United Nations Security Council called on Friday for an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/20/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah/a-dangerous-pandoras-box-un-security-council-members-are-alarmed-by-device-attacks?smid=url-share" title="">investigation into the operations in Lebanon</a> — widely attributed to Israel — that detonated the pagers and walkie-talkies. The nature of the attacks, which transformed ordinary objects into weapons, raised alarms and drew widespread condemnation at the meeting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heavy bombardment:</strong> The building struck on Friday in Beirut’s southern suburbs was one of more than 100 sites, mostly in southern Lebanon, that Israel has targeted since Thursday evening. Lebanese officials said the strikes overnight were some of the heaviest bombardment there in months of back-and-forth attacks. Earlier Friday, Israel said Hezbollah fired at least 140 rockets into northern Israel. Israel said its air defenses had intercepted some of the rockets and that others had fallen in unpopulated areas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hezbollah scrambles:</strong> Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, sounded defiant in a speech on Thursday, saying that the group would not cease its cross-border strikes against Israel. But the group was also struggling to formulate an appropriate response to the pager and walkie-talkie attacks, analysts said. Mr. Nasrallah said it had formed committees to investigate the lapses that led the pagers and radios to be compromised.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRiOThiOThhLWYzNzMtNWJjMy1iZTZmLTM2NjIyYjg0OGY5NA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/21/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah#northern-israel-braces-for-a-backlash-even-as-the-conflict-remains-under-the-radar-in-tel-aviv" data-source-id="100000009711493"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack"><img alt="Liam Stack" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/multimedia/author-liam-stack/author-liam-stack-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/multimedia/author-liam-stack/author-liam-stack-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/multimedia/author-liam-stack/author-liam-stack-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-21T13:31:11.813Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 21, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack" itemprop="name">Liam Stack</a></p><p>Reporting from Tel Aviv</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRiOThiOThhLWYzNzMtNWJjMy1iZTZmLTM2NjIyYjg0OGY5NA=="><a href="#northern-israel-braces-for-a-backlash-even-as-the-conflict-remains-under-the-radar-in-tel-aviv">Northern Israel braces for a backlash, even as the conflict remains under the radar in Tel Aviv.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A beach on Saturday in Tel Aviv was a marked contrast to the tensions in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Menahem Kahana/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Northern Israel was bracing for a potential counterattack from Hezbollah on Saturday, after a <a href="#israel-lebanon-attacks-hezbollah-war" title="">week of apparent Israeli attacks</a> in Lebanon killed dozens, including Hezbollah commanders, and wounded thousands more.</p><p>Many towns across the border area have been largely empty since the cross-border fighting drove tens of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html" title="">thousands of people</a> from their homes last October when the war between Israel and Hamas, a Hezbollah ally, began in the Gaza Strip.</p><div><p>For residents who remain, the sounds of air-raid sirens and rockets bursting high overhead have become the norm. On Saturday, Hezbollah fired more than two dozen rockets into Israel, but there were no casualties reported. </p><p>In Safed and Katzrin, two towns where many residents have chosen not to leave, the military advised people on Saturday to stay close to bomb shelters. In the farthest reaches of Israel, including the Golan Heights and a narrow ribbon of land along the Lebanese border, the military imposed restrictions that it said would be in effect until Thursday. They include limits to the size of gatherings, restrictions on some schools and workplaces, and the closing of beaches.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system intercepting rockets fired from Lebanon over the Upper Galilee region of northern Israel on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jalaa Marey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel also took the unusual step on Saturday of closing the airspace in the northern third of the country to all private flights, in an effort to quiet the skies north of Hadera, a beach city halfway between Tel Aviv and Haifa.</p><p>The restrictions do not affect commercial flights, the military said, adding that they were being imposed “ to maintain the security of flights and in accordance with operational activity.”</p><p>But farther south in Tel Aviv, a city sometimes referred to as “The Bubble” because of its geographical and psychological distance from the fighting, the tensions of the past week appeared not to dampen the mood on a bright late-summer Saturday.</p><p>There, in Israel’s densely populated central heartland, few outward signs were visible of the war in Gaza, 40 miles to the south, or the escalating conflict along the border with Lebanon, 80 miles to the north.</p><p>Families flocked to the beach, where children played in the surf and dozens of sailboats bobbed on the waves. Many businesses were closed as usual for the sabbath, but those that were open were bustling and full of life.</p><p>In the Jaffa neighborhood, teenagers crowded into pizzerias, sun-tanned people stood in line for iced coffees at hip cafes, and older people smoked water pipes and drank tea at sidewalk cafes.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjJmOTI0OTAtMTQ2My01MjliLWI4NzAtMzQ2NmFlM2ZiNmQ5"><div id="62f92490-1463-529b-b870-3466ae3fb6d9" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/21/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah#62f92490-1463-529b-b870-3466ae3fb6d9"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward"><img alt="Euan Ward" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-21T13:15:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 21, 2024, 9:15 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward" itemprop="name">Euan Ward</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>At least 37 people have now been killed following the Israeli strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday, said Lebanon’s health ministry.

Israel has not claimed responsibility for this week’s attacks on devices, or for many other attacks that have been attributed to it. They include:</p><h3 id="link-1f54deb2"><span><strong>Attacks on Iran’s nuclear program</strong></span></h3><p>A series of operations, including assassinations and sabotage, over the years have targeted senior leaders involved with Iran’s nuclear program. These included the poisoning of a nuclear scientist in 2007 and the killing of another in 2010 by a remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle.</p><p>From 2010 to 2012, four people with links to Iran’s nuclear program were killed by hit men riding motorcycles. In one case, in 2010, an assassin attached a sticky bomb to a car door. In others, gunmen approached vehicles in the Iranian capital, Tehran, and fired through the window before speeding off.</p><p>In November 2020, Iran’s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was killed by gunshots fired from a truck-mounted machine gun that had been attached to a remote-controlled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fakhrizadeh-assassination-israel.html" title="">robotic apparatus</a>. Experts said the operation had taken months, and likely years, of planning.</p><h3 id="link-28917cd4"><span><strong>Cyber warfare and nuclear secrets</strong></span></h3><p>Starting in 2006, U.S. military and Israeli intelligence officials began a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/how-a-secret-cyberwar-program-worked.html?hp" title="">top-secret cyberwar program</a> against Iran’s nuclear enrichment program.</p><p>Israel’s Dimona complex, the heart of its never-acknowledged nuclear arms program in the Negev desert, was used as a testing ground for the Stuxnet computer worm. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html" title="">destructive program</a> was eventually credited with wiping out roughly a fifth of Iran’s nuclear centrifuges, which Tehran needs to produce a nuclear weapon.</p><p>In 2018, Israeli spies armed with torches broke into a warehouse in Tehran and seized a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/15/us/politics/iran-israel-mossad-nuclear.html" title="">trove of documents</a> about Iran’s nuclear program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel later used the documents to accuse Iran of lying for years about its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/world/middleeast/israel-iran-nuclear-netanyahu.html" title="">efforts to build</a> a nuclear weapon.</p><h3 id="link-ede9f92"><span><strong>After Oct. 7</strong></span></h3><p>Since the Hamas-led attack on Israel last Oct. 7, Israel has conducted a series of assassinations of commanders of Iran’s regional proxy forces, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p><p>These attacks have come at the same time as Israel’s wide-scale military offensive in Gaza, which health officials there say have killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. The United Nations, rights groups and some governments have accused Israel of using disproportionate force in its war in Gaza against Hamas. Israel says its use of force is justified and legal.</p><p>In April, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/world/middleeast/iran-commanders-killed-syria-israel.html" title="">bombed a building</a> that was part of the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing seven people, including a general who oversaw Iran’s covert military operations in Syria and Lebanon. In response, Iran launched a missile and drone attack on Israel, the first time it had attempted to strike the country directly after a decadeslong shadow war.</p><p>In July, Israel assassinated a senior leader of Hezbollah, Fuad Shukr, in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/fuad-shukr-hezbollah-israel-strike.html" title="">airstrike on a house</a> in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.

And in the days before his death, Israel incapacitated hundreds, if not thousands, of the group’s rank-and-file members by remotely blowing up their pagers and walkie-talkies.</p><p>Hezbollah’s response so far: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/world/middleeast/hezbollah-nasrallah-israel-lebanon-explosions.html" title="">calls for vengeance</a> and routine rocket fire into northern Israel.</p><div><p>The assassination of the senior military leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/world/middleeast/beirut-israel-hezbollah-airstrike.html" title="">Ibrahim Aqeel</a>, and other ranking Hezbollah militants on Friday capped a week that threw Lebanon’s most sophisticated political and military force <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-hezbollah-pagers-hospitals-funerals.html" title="">into deep disarray</a> and appeared to hail a stark shift in the calculations that had long governed the decades-old conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.</p><p>Since the two forces effectively fought each other to a standstill in a hugely destructive war in 2006, Israel and Hezbollah have been arming up and preparing for the next major confrontation, feeding a situation of mutual deterrence that kept intermittent clashes along the Lebanon-Israel border from spiraling into another big war.</p><p>Israelis feared that a new conflict could include Hezbollah’s targeting of sensitive infrastructure inside Israel and well-trained Hezbollah commandos rampaging though Israeli communities. Hezbollah knew that Israel’s air force could swiftly cause extensive destruction in Lebanon, especially in the communities from which the group draws its support.</p><p>This past week, however, Israel’s leaders decided to push past that equation and crossed what had been unofficially considered red lines. So far, it appears to have worked.</p><p>“Eighteen years of mutual deterrence has now given way to a new phase of one-sided superiority on the part of Israel,” said Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. “The facade that Hezbollah had been presenting to the world of it being an impenetrable organization is shattered, and Israel has displayed with flair how much of an upper hand it has in this equation vis-à-vis Hezbollah.”</p><p>Both Israel and Hezbollah confirmed that Mr. Aqeel, whom Israel described as leading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/world/middleeast/hezbollah-radwan-ibrahim-aqeel.html" title="">Hezbollah’s Radwan force, an elite combat unit</a>, had been killed in the airstrike on Friday, and Hezbollah on Saturday announced the deaths of about a dozen other fighters, including Ahmed Wahbi, another ranking commander. The Israeli military said that at least 16 Hezbollah fighters had been killed in the strike on Mr. Aqeel, but did not identify them.</p><p>The attack, in a densely populated area south of Beirut known as the Dahiya, brought down two eight-story buildings and terrified people across the Lebanese capital.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The aftermath on Saturday of the Israeli airstrike on a residential building in Beirut’s southern suburbs a day earlier.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>On Saturday, Lebanon’s health ministry said the toll from the strike had risen to 37 dead, including three children, and 68 wounded. In the aftermath, Lebanese families circulated images of missing relatives on social media, including children. Overall, 70 people have been killed in Lebanon since Tuesday, and about 3,000 injured.</p><p>Friday’s strike followed 11 months of tit-for-tat strikes between Hezbollah and Israel across the Lebanon-Israel border that killed people on both sides and forced about 150,000 residents to flee their homes. Hezbollah began striking northern Israel after the start of the war in Gaza last October, saying that it was seeking to bog down Israeli forces in support of Hamas, its ally in Gaza.</p><p>The Hamas assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7 that started the war killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 dragged back to Gaza, damaging Israel’s sense of security and changing how its leaders thought about the threats on their borders.</p><p>Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza that aimed to destroy the group. Months of cease-fire negotiations have failed to stop the violence, and the Gaza health authorities say that more than 41,000 people have been killed.</p><p>Israel’s tolerance for Hezbollah’s military presence on its northern border has also declined, and even before this past week Israeli officials regularly called for stepped-up attacks on the group.</p><p>“It has been very clear since the first months of the war that Israel is saying, ‘This threat that we lived with for 18 years, we are not able to live with it any more,’” said Paul Salem, the vice president for international engagement at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “‘We can’t have this massive force on our northern border.’”</p><p>Underpinning the status quo before the Gaza war was an Israeli resistance to risking losses and sustaining damage compared with the professed willingness of Hezbollah fighters to die for their cause, Mr. Salem said. That dynamic, too, has changed.</p><p>“The simple threat of Hezbollah causing damage no longer has the same effect on Israel that it had before Oct. 7,” he said.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rockets fired from southern Lebanon were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system over the Upper Galilee region of northern Israel on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jalaa Marey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>This past week, Israel dramatically upended how it fights Hezbollah by infiltrating the group’s supply chain to booby-trap thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies, severely disrupting its communications, in addition to conventional airstrikes like the one that killed Mr. Aqeel and other commanders. That combination has constricted Hezbollah’s ability to respond.</p><p>“Hezbollah has been backed into a corner by Israel,” said Ms. Khatib of Chatham House. “Even if its military arsenal remains intact, its ability to deploy it has been curtailed.”</p><p>On Friday, Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, said that Israel would continue its “series of actions in the new stage” of its conflict with Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from the border area can return home. Some experts view that language as suggesting that Israel’s plans could include a ground invasion.</p><p>In a speech on Thursday, Hezbollah’s leaders said they welcomed such a step. Hezbollah was formed in the 1980s to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended in 2000, and fighting on their own turf could give its guerrilla fighters an advantage.</p><p>Despite Israel’s superior firepower, it has not managed to defeat Hamas in 11 months of brutal combat in Gaza, whose borders are closed. Hezbollah is widely regarded as a more sophisticated force and could take advantage of Lebanon’s open borders to rearm in a way that Hamas cannot.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYzQ2MDU2OTItNDllNS01ZDNhLWFjYTYtZDYwYTU0MjJiZWQw"><div id="c4605692-49e5-5d3a-aca6-d60a5422bed0" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/21/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah#c4605692-49e5-5d3a-aca6-d60a5422bed0"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erika-solomon"><img alt="Erika Solomon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-21T09:17:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 21, 2024, 5:17 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erika-solomon" itemprop="name">Erika Solomon</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>Lebanon’s health minister, Firas Abiad, said the number of people killed in Israel&#39;s strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut had risen to 31, including three children and seven women.

The stupendous explosion felt across the capital killed 241 American service members and injured more than 100 others.</p><p>The toll in the Marine Corps, with 220 dead, was its worse single-day loss since the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. A second suicide bomber who drove into a building housing French peacekeeping forces killed an additional 60 soldiers.</p><p>Six months earlier, a similar attack that pancaked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut had killed 17 Americans, including the core of the C.I.A. station in the Middle East, as well as 32 Lebanese and 14 others.</p><p>The murderous attacks were claimed by the Islamic Jihad Organization, considered a precursor to Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese militia and political organization built and backed by Iran to advance its interests in the region.</p><p>In the years since, the United States government singled out Mr. Aqeel, believed to be in his mid-60s, as a “specially designated global terrorist” with a $7 million bounty on his head. He was also believed to have been involved in some of the kidnappings of Western hostages in Beirut in the 1980s as well as attacks in France. Several other senior figures considered to be involved have also been killed in the current conflict.</p><p>Imad Mughniyeh, believed to be behind both the suicide bombings and numerous kidnappings, died in a car bombing in Damascus, Syria, in 2008.</p><p>The United States and several European nations had deployed a peacekeeping force in Beirut in 1982, meant to assure stability in the capital as the armed fighters of the Palestine Liberation Organization withdrew from the city as part of the deal to end an Israeli invasion.</p><p>As time passed, however, the foreign forces were increasingly drawn into the fray. The effort to push the United States to withdraw its troops culminated in the two suicide bombings. Although not unprecedented at that time, no such bombings had been done on that scale before, and it ushered in a new era of similar attacks.</p><p>In addition, although President Ronald Reagan vowed that the American peacekeeping force would stay, as did other European governments, they were withdrawn within months. The bombings had achieved their aim.</p><p>It was the worst but hardly the only attack against American diplomats in the city, and it prompted a strengthening of security measures for U.S. diplomatic missions and military installations around the world. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut, for example, is now an armed fortress on a hill north of Beirut, and the U.S. ambassador moves around in a long motorcade of armored S.U.V.s.</p><p>The attacks came not long after the 1979 revolution in Iran that gave birth to the Islamic Republic, and they also ushered in that country’s violent efforts to assert itself in the region through proxy forces.</p><p>Sheelagh McNeill<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2YxZDQ2MzY0LWIwMDgtNTdhZi05NTFjLTQzMzM2MDZiOTBlNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/21/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah#a-dangerous-pandoras-box-un-security-council-members-are-alarmed-by-device-attacks" data-source-id="100000009710912"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni"><img alt="Ephrat Livni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-20T23:48:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 20, 2024, 7:48 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni" itemprop="name">Ephrat Livni</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2YxZDQ2MzY0LWIwMDgtNTdhZi05NTFjLTQzMzM2MDZiOTBlNg=="><a href="#a-dangerous-pandoras-box-un-security-council-members-are-alarmed-by-device-attacks">‘A dangerous Pandora’s box’: U.N.

He noted that all parties to the conflict were expected to follow international humanitarian law but argued that Hezbollah had shattered stability in the region when it began striking Israel’s northern border in solidarity with Hamas following the Oct. 7 attack that set off the war in Gaza.</p><p>Britain’s representative, James Kariuki, took a similar approach. “Hezbollah launched an unprovoked attack on Israel on Oct. 8, 2023,” he said, adding that Britain was “resolute” in its “support for Israel’s right to defend its citizens.”</p><p>Both the British and American representatives also blamed Iran for fueling tensions in the region by supplying Hezbollah with weapons, and they accused Iran of undermining the Lebanese people’s hopes of living in peace.</p><p>All the council members appeared unified on one matter, however, calling for restraint from everyone involved in the conflict to prevent an escalation that could lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/us/politics/us-biden-israel-iran-war.html" title="">a regional war</a>. “Now is the time for calm heads,” Mr. Kariuki said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzJjOTUwYjFiLWE1YmMtNTNlZi04N2ZlLTc0ZmY2NzNlMmQzMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/21/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah#israel-lebanon-attacks-hezbollah-war" data-source-id="100000009709021"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley"><img alt="Patrick Kingsley" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-patrick-kingsley/author-patrick-kingsley-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-patrick-kingsley/author-patrick-kingsley-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/multimedia/author-patrick-kingsley/author-patrick-kingsley-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-20T16:37:35.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 20, 2024, 12:37 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley" itemprop="name">Patrick Kingsley</a></p><p>reporting from Jerusalem</p></div></div></div></div><p>News Analysis</p><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzJjOTUwYjFiLWE1YmMtNTNlZi04N2ZlLTc0ZmY2NzNlMmQzMg=="><a href="#israel-lebanon-attacks-hezbollah-war">Israel’s attacks bring the conflict closer to all-out war but stop short of a decisive shift.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People gathering at the scene of an Israeli strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bilal Hussein/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Exploding pagers on Tuesday. Detonating walkie-talkies on Wednesday. An unusually intense barrage of bombs on Thursday. And a huge strike on southern Beirut on Friday.</p><p>Israeli attacks on Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, this week constitute a significant escalation in the 11-month war between the two sides. For nearly a year, Israel and Hezbollah have fought a low-level conflict, mostly along the Israeli-Lebanese border, that has gradually gathered force without ever exploding into an all-out war.</p><div><p>Now, Israel is attempting a riskier playbook. It has markedly increased the intensity of its attacks in an attempt to force Hezbollah to back down, while raising the chances of the opposite outcome: a more aggressive response from Hezbollah that devolves into an unbridled land war.</p><p>Israel has sabotaged Hezbollah’s communications devices, blowing up hundreds, if not thousands, of them in a widespread cyberattack. Its fighter jets have pounded southern Lebanon with rare intensity. And on Friday afternoon, they struck Beirut, the Lebanese capital, for the first time since July — killing a senior Hezbollah military commander, according to Israeli officials, and collapsing two buildings, according to Lebanese officials.</p><p>Yet, despite the escalation, the fundamental balance between the two sides appeared to remain unchanged on Friday afternoon, at least for the time being.</p><p>Israel’s moves fell short of a decisive blow, humiliating Hezbollah and spreading horror through Lebanese society, but so far failing to coerce the militia into changing course.</p><p>The militia launched more short-range strikes on northern Israel on Friday, hours after its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/world/middleeast/hezbollah-nasrallah-israel-lebanon-explosions.html" title="">pledged</a> to continue its campaign until Israel ends its parallel conflict in Gaza, which began with deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel in October. But the strikes this week appeared to be tit-for-tat attacks of the kind have been conducted for 11 months.</p><p>Hezbollah has pledged a specific response to Israel’s attacks on its pagers and walkie-talkies, which killed at least 37 people and injured thousands more. But it has not set a time frame for retaliation, a possible sign that, with so many of its operatives in the hospital, the group is still taking stock of its losses.</p><p>Israel’s leaders have said the conflict has entered a new phase, with Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, promising on Thursday that Hezbollah would pay an increasing price “as time goes by.” But he stopped well short of pledging a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.</p><p>The Israeli military has said it moved a paratrooper division to northern Israel but does not appear to be on the cusp of a major ground maneuver, even as its air force and intelligence agencies scale up their attacks.</p><p>For now, both the conflict in Lebanon and the war in Gaza are stuck in limbo: The Israel-Hezbollah conflict seems unlikely to ease without a truce in Gaza, and negotiations to reach that truce have ground nearly to a halt amid persistent differences between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>Both conflicts appear far from a military resolution, too. For all its new moves, Israel still seems several steps away from a decisive military blow in Lebanon, and has failed to achieve one in Gaza, despite decimating Hamas’s forces there. The group still holds dozens of hostages in the pockets of Gaza that it controls, preventing Israel from declaring victory.</p><p>Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM4OWYzYzA2LTYxMTMtNTg3ZS04NmU0LTFhMmRiMjFkOTdlNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/21/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah#ibrahim-aqeel-hezbollah-commander-what-to-know" data-source-id="100000009709023"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman"><img alt="Aaron Boxerman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-20T15:19:26.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 20, 2024, 11:19 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman" itemprop="name">Aaron Boxerman</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM4OWYzYzA2LTYxMTMtNTg3ZS04NmU0LTFhMmRiMjFkOTdlNA=="><a href="#ibrahim-aqeel-hezbollah-commander-what-to-know">Who is Ibrahim Aqeel, the Hezbollah commander targeted by Israel?</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene of an Israeli strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bilal Hussein/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Ibrahim Aqeel, the Hezbollah commander killed by Israel on Friday in Beirut, was one of the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group’s most senior leaders.</p><p>Mr. Aqeel, 61, had already survived multiple assassination attempts, and the United States had offered a multimillion-dollar bounty for his capture. In a statement, Hezbollah mourned his death, saying he had lived a life “full of struggle, action, wounds, and sacrifices” as well as “achievements and victories.”</p><div><p>A member of Hezbollah more or less since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/what-is-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">its establishment in the 1980s</a>, Mr. Aqeel served on the group’s highest military body, the Jihad Council. Over the past two decades, Israel has slowly killed many of the Jihad Council’s members, who are some of the closest advisers to Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p>In an official obituary distributed by Hezbollah, the group said Mr. Aqeel played a major role in overseeing the training and development of its ranks. He oversaw the establishment of the Radwan force, Hezbollah’s elite commandoes, as well as its operations until his death, according to the obituary. </p><p>U.S. officials wanted Mr. Aqeel for his role in two bombing attacks in 1983 that killed more than 350 people at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine Corps barracks, many of them American citizens, according to the State Department.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An undated photograph from a wanted poster circulated by the State Department of Ibrahim Aqeel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. State Department/Handout, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Last year, the State Department posted <a href="https://www.state.gov/rewards-for-justice-reward-offer-for-information-on-hizballah-leader-ibrahim-aqil/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a reward of up to $7 million</a> for information leading to his identification, location, arrest or conviction. It said Mr. Aqeel also directed the abduction of American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s.</p><p>Since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, Hezbollah has been firing rockets and drones at Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza, prompting Israeli counterattacks. In particular, Mr. Aqeel had overseen the Radwan commandoes’ operations along that front, Hezbollah said. </p><p>Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, described Mr. Aqeel as the chief of Hezbollah’s military operations directorate and the de facto commander of the Radwan force. He was responsible for overseeing Hezbollah’s anti-tank missile units and air-defense operations, among other roles, Admiral Hagari said.</p><p>“Aqeel had large amounts of blood on his hands,” he told reporters at a news conference. “He was responsible for the deaths of many civilians and innocents.”</p><p>Mr. Aqeel helped plan a never-carried-out Hezbollah invasion of northern Israel similar to that of the Hamas-led assault of southern Israel on Oct. 7, Admiral Hagari said.</p><p>Israeli officials have long warned that Hezbollah hoped to one day send<span>  </span>highly trained fighters across the border, conquering Israeli towns and seizing hostages in a bloody blow to their foes. </p><p>In 2019,<span>  </span>Mr. Nasrallah confirmed that the group had operational plans for entering northern Israel in the event of a war but declined to give details.

Former U.S. officials called Mr. Shukr, like Mr. Aqeel, one of Hezbollah’s most senior military leaders and a confidant of Mr. Nasrallah.</p><p>Assaf Orion, a retired Israeli brigadier general, said on Friday that Mr. Aqeel was effectively the top operations officer in Hezbollah’s military apparatus, one who was involved in “numerous” attacks against Israelis.</p><p>“He’s an extremely seasoned operations veteran,” said General Orion, a former Israeli military liaison to the international peacekeeping mission along the Lebanese-Israeli border.</p><p>Israel had tried to assassinate Mr. Aqeel numerous times in the past, but each time he managed to escape with his life, General Orion said.</p><p>In 2000, Israeli helicopters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/07/world/israeli-killed-in-lebanon-spurring-calls-to-retaliate.html" title="">fired on Mr. Aqeel’s car</a> in an attempt to avenge the killing of a Lebanese militia leader aligned with Israel, but he survived with only slight injuries.
