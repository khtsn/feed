    <h1>What to Expect From Trump’s Address to Congress</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump goes to the Capitol this evening for his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-speech-what-to-watch.html" title="">first address to a joint session of Congress</a> since his return to the White House in January. The speech will offer him his most prominent platform so far to promote his sweeping transformation of the federal government and lay out his vision for the future.</p><p>“He has had a whirlwind first 43 days, a blitzkrieg of action,” Luke Broadwater, our White House correspondent, told me. “Now he’s going to tout all of the things that he’s done that he believes are good for the country. And he will be cheered by Republicans.”</p><p>There is nothing constitutionally mandated about the event. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-speech-congress-state-of-the-union.html" title="">It’s not technically a State of the Union speech</a>. But every president since Ronald Reagan has used the address to reach a wide audience. And Trump, ever the performer, is not one to turn down an opportunity like that. </p><p>The president promised to “TELL IT LIKE IT IS” during the speech, which is scheduled to begin shortly after 9 p.m. Eastern time. The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/trump-news-doge-ukraine" title="">will stream the address here</a>, with live analysis from reporters. Here are three things to watch for:</p><p><strong>1. Trump will probably mention Ukraine. </strong></p><p>The president has said he wants to be remembered as a “peacemaker,” and he is expected to discuss his promise of a quick end to the war in Ukraine. But his support for Ukraine has seemed to erode: Recently he had a combative meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/europe/trump-ukraine-aid.html" title="">last night</a>, the U.S. temporarily suspended aid to the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/europe/ukraine-us-trump-military-support.html" title="">Zelensky offered new terms today to stop the fighting with Russia</a>. So, as Luke pointed out, it will be interesting to see how Trump addresses Ukraine and whether he still talks about the country as an ally.</p><p><strong>2. Trump is expected to talk up Elon Musk’s team.</strong></p><p>The president is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-speech-congress-doge-ukraine.html" title="">highlight the efforts he and Musk have undertaken</a> to cut government spending — including by firing workers and suspending foreign aid — using executive authority alone.</p><p>An earlier iteration of the Republican Party might have objected to the president’s apparent disregard for Congress’s control of the purse, Luke told me. “But this Republican Party has, block by block, been remade in Trump’s image,” he said. “For many, it’s their dream presidency.”</p><p><strong>3. It’s not clear how Democrats will react.</strong></p><p>Democrats have had a rough few months. Their party is out of power. They are largely leaderless. And they have struggled to respond to the frenzy of activity from the Trump administration. </p><p>“Many Democrats think he is tearing down the government, offending allies abroad and turning the country backward,” Luke said. They want to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/trump-news-doge-ukraine/with-boycotts-stickers-and-guests-democrats-are-protesting-trumps-speech" title="">use tonight to express their concerns</a>, but it’s not clear what will resonate. Some will boycott the speech, and others are inviting fired federal workers to attend.
