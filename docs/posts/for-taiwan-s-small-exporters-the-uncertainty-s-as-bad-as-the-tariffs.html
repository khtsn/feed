His business, like all of Taiwan’s export-dependent manufacturers, could be hit hard.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s 90-day pause on most of the tariffs gave Taiwan, and much of the world, some breathing space. For now, Taiwan faces a 10 percent tariff on many of its products, not the 32 percent Mr. Trump had threatened. The fact that China, Taiwan’s enormous manufacturing rival and would-be ruler, has been hit with tariffs of 145 percent might look like an opportunity. But that could cause aftershocks of its own for Taiwan’s exporters.</p><p>Taiwan needs to be nimble to cope with the new era of disruption in global trade, including the possibility that Mr. Trump could raise tariffs again, Mr. Tang said. His business, Aegis CNC, does not export directly to the United States, but many customers for its precision manufacturing tools are factories in Taiwan and Southeast Asia that do so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-1"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11int-taiwan-tariffs-01-vjbl/11int-taiwan-tariffs-01-vjbl-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“It’s the butterfly effect. It’s not as simple as saying that only those selling to the United States will be affected.”</p><p>Alex Tang, general manger of Aegis CNC in Taichung</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Some U.S. traders that buy from Taiwan have put on a hold, asked their suppliers to put orders on hold” while they try to figure out what might happen, Mr. Tang said in his workshop, a green corrugated shed surrounded by rice fields. “It’s a burden, this uncertainty because of Trump.”</p><p>During two days of interviews in central Taiwan, the island’s manufacturing heartland, other business owners echoed that sentiment: The tariffs are one cost, and the uncertainty is another. And they could face a deluge of competition from Chinese exporters, priced out of the U.S. market by tariffs and seeking customers elsewhere. Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, visited the central city of Taichung on Friday to discuss the tariffs’ effects with manufacturers.</p><p>Taiwan is known for its semiconductor plants, which make the world’s most advanced chips. Those were spared tariffs by Mr. Trump because of their importance to U.S. tech companies. But Taiwan, with some <a href="https://eng.stat.gov.tw/Point.aspx?sid=t.9&amp;n=4208&amp;sms=11713" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">23 million people</a>, also makes plenty of the consumer goods that stock American stores — bicycles, car parts, kitchen appliances, stationery and even <a href="https://www.anvil.tw/en/service/product/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lacrosse sticks</a>. It also makes many of the factory-floor machines that create those products, either in Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-4"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11int-taiwan-tariffs-05-vjbl/11int-taiwan-tariffs-05-vjbl-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“Tariffs are a blow to our industry. I was stunned when the hammer came down.”</p><p>Tsan-Jung Bai, president of the Sun Jen textile company in Changhua</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Many Taiwanese manufacturers are small and medium-size businesses, like Mr. Tang’s company, which makes precision lathes that cut, grind and drill lumps of metal or other materials into product parts.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Taiwanese companies have thrived by remaining small and very frugal, with no debt,” said Alicia García Herrero, the chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, an investment bank. “But often they have not scaled up, and this is very different from the Chinese mainland.”</p><p>Taiwanese manufacturers said Mr. Trump’s tariffs were just the latest shock they had endured in recent years. Others included the Covid crisis; Europe’s faltering growth, especially after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; and, perhaps above all, the surge in exports from China.</p><p>Most said they could cope with Mr. Trump’s 10 percent tariff on Taiwan. Some predicted opportunity as American importers look for alternatives to China. But many worried that the uncertainty and broader price pressures generated by Mr. Trump’s tariffs could drive orders down well beyond the United States.</p><p>“It’s like a typhoon,” Catherine Yen, a sales manager for Aegis CNC, said of the trade upheavals. She said she had spent her days trying to drum up new orders in the Middle East and elsewhere. “The eye of the typhoon is the instant impact directly on exports to the United States, but actually there’s also the wider circles from that swirling around us — the upstream and downstream connections — and that’s the scary thing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-8"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11int-taiwan-tariffs-02-vjbl/11int-taiwan-tariffs-02-vjbl-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“I’m in sales, so I just have to keep working on opening up regions that weren’t as hard hit.”</p><p>Catherine Yen, a sales manager for Aegis CNC</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>An American flag flies along with a Taiwanese one over Henry Yang’s company in Taichung. The firm exports plumbing products — valves, faucets, pipes — to the United States, an example of the close bonds that many small Taiwanese exporters have formed with U.S. customers.</p><p>Mr. Yang said he sympathized with Mr. Trump’s goal of reviving American manufacturing, but wondered how long it would take the United States to recruit and train workers for sophisticated, demanding manufacturing jobs. Even in Taiwan, he said, it was getting harder to find young people willing to work in factories. (Many Taiwanese plants employ migrant workers from Southeast Asia.)</p><p>“I think that the manufacturer will certainly have to absorb some of it, and the importer will, too,” Mr. Yang said of the new 10 percent tariffs on many Taiwanese products. He said of Mr. Trump: “If you ask my personal view, I think he’s got his reasons for doing this, because the United States has been hollowed out.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-11"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11int-taiwan-tariffs-03-vjbl/11int-taiwan-tariffs-03-vjbl-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“We’re still waiting to hear from a lot of our American clients on their strategies for the tariffs.” </p><p>Richard Yang, a vice president of marketing and sales at his father’s plumbing parts business in Taichung</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Yang, 73, is from Lukang, a town <a href="https://tourism.chcg.gov.tw/AttractionsContent.aspx?id=547&amp;chk=49a7203f-581e-45e6-bcbf-71b576f58431&amp;l=EN" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">known for making plumbing products</a>. He turned that background into a business, filling orders from the United States and elsewhere by tapping into a wide network of manufacturers for parts.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>That formula has served Taiwan well. For decades, its small and medium-size manufacturing firms have defied expectations that bigger Chinese competitors would overwhelm them. Instead, they learned to adapt, using their flexibility and their networks to address customers’ needs and developing bonds of trust with buyers abroad.</p><p>“Taiwan’s strength lies in doing small orders and lots of choices,” said Jack Lee, the chairman of 7-Leaders Corp., which makes cutting tools sold by American retailers under a variety of brands. “Mainland China may be catching up and has a few firms that are competitive with us, but what if they get locked out of the United States by the tariffs?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-15"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11int-taiwan-tariffs-04-vjbl/11int-taiwan-tariffs-04-vjbl-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“America can do all the design and technology, but it’s hard there to find people to operate machinery.”</p><p>Jack Lee of 7-Leaders Corp., which makes cutting tools in Taichung</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Taiwan has about 144,000 small and medium-size businesses in its manufacturing sector, employing about two million workers, and they directly account for 12 percent of the island’s manufactured exports, according to <a href="https://www.sme.gov.tw/article-tw-2344-12183" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government statistics</a>. But these firms often make parts for bigger Taiwanese exporters, disguising the real scale of their contribution.</p><p>“With their highly decentralized, highly flexible production and supply networks, they can supply many different customers. That’s been a main source of their competitiveness,” said <a href="https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/fellow/michellefeiyuhsieh" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michelle Hsieh</a>, a sociologist at Academia Sinica, a research academy, who studies the role of small Taiwanese firms in <a href="https://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/Articles/Details?Guid=b5d26eca-8927-4a7a-ab7f-17fc6609c32a&amp;CatId=9&amp;postname=Spinning%20Wheels%3A-How%20Taiwan%20Became%20a%20Hub%20for%20High-End%20Bicycle%20Manufacturing&amp;srsltid=AfmBOord5p1obt8JUJAzXthPD8dzlqbI9pQeJJ2p-98-OgErRvH-Yo06" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">making bicycles</a> and other goods. “They’re often talking about providing manufacturing service solutions that are very specific to the customer.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Taiwanese manufacturers with markets in Europe and elsewhere said they were worried that Chinese competitors would try even more ferociously to undercut them, perhaps helped by state subsidies. On the other hand, Samuel Hu said companies like his would seek new customers in the United States, where Mr. Trump’s tariffs could put Chinese imports out of reach. Mr. Hu is the president of <a href="https://astroeng.com.tw/index.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Astro Tech</a>, a company in central Taiwan that makes high-end e-bikes and bike frames for retailers, mostly in Europe.</p><p>“For Taiwanese manufacturers, this is also an opportunity to enter the U.S. market,” Mr. Hu said.
