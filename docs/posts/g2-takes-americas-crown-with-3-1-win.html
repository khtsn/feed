		<p>G2 Esports has defeated Sentinels 3-1 in the VCT Americas Stage 1 grand final. G2 is now the first-ever back-to-back Americas champions, as well as the only team to win two Americas titles in the partnership era. </p>

<p>The eighth encounter between the two teams began on Haven, with G2 taking the map 13-9 despite a strong first half from Sentinels. Split mirrored the first map, another 13-9 for G2 with a dominant second half. Sentinels bounced back on Pearl, continuing an undefeated streak on the map after denying G2 a comeback. Defense-sided Ascent was the final map, a 13-10 going G2&#39;s way thanks in part to taking both pistol rounds and having a better attack than their opponents. </p>

<p>The win allows G2 to skip the Masters: Toronto swiss stage, seeding them directly into the playoffs. G2 also earns five Championship points, setting them well on track for Champions: Paris qualification. Sentinels, meanwhile, will go to Masters as the second Americas seed, and only earning three Championship points for their efforts. </p>
