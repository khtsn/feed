</span> has <a href="https://x.com/teamrrqofficial/status/1978795102899511463" target="_blank">announced</a> the departure of head coach <span data-ref-id="1">Marthinus		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8347/ewok">Ewok</a>&#34;
		Jacobus Van Der Walt</span>. </p>

<p>&#34;Today, we announce the difficult decision that Ewok will be taking a break from the 2026 season,&#34; a <a href="https://x.com/calvinthenderan/status/1978803518132879398" target="_blank">release from RRQ co-owner Nano read</a>. &#34;We, together with Ewok, have explored various ways for him to continue into the upcoming season, but ultimately reached the difficult conclusion that he will not be able to continue as a full-time coach... Though we wished for a different outcome, we fully respect Ewok&#39;s decision and on behalf of everyone in RRQ would like to sincerely thank him for his dedication, hard work, and invaluable contributions to RRQ Valorant.&#34; </p>

<p>Ewok joined RRQ ahead of the 2023 season, Valorant&#39;s first year of the partnership era, and has pulled them from one of the region&#39;s middling teams to one of the top contenders. Prior to RRQ, he held coaching positions at <span data-ref-id="2">

In his first campaign with the team, Ewok and RRQ finished seventh in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1191/champions-tour-2023-pacific-league/league-play" target="_blank">Pacific League</a>, just missing out on the regional playoffs, and then fourth at the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1660/champions-tour-2023-pacific-last-chance-qualifier/main-event" target="_blank">Pacific LCQ</a>. In 2024, RRQ again fell short of reaching the international stage, finishing 7th-8th with a fourth-place finish in their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2002/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-1/regular-season" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> group. A stronger <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> earned them a spot in the playoffs, but they fell in the opening knockout round to eventual winners <span data-ref-id="4">

<p>In 2025, RRQ looked to get overcome their past hurdles as a middling team in the region. While another early elimination befell them in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/vct-2025-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a>, resulting in a 7th-8th finish, a personnel change, bringing in <span data-ref-id="5">

</span> as a new in-game leader, appeared to spark a change. After finishing atop a four-way tie of 3-2 teams in their group, RRQ ended the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> playoffs victorious, defeating Gen.G to lift their first-ever VCT title and qualify for their first international LAN in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. While RRQ disappointed with an 0-2 showing in the playoffs at Toronto, they returned to regional play with a repeat on their minds. They finished second in their group to qualify for the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> playoffs, and this time forced to make a lower bracket run after being dealt an early defeat. After four straight victories, RRQ clinched their spot in the grand final, where they came up short against perennial powerhouse <span data-ref-id="6">

</span>. RRQ qualified for their first-ever Champions event, but only went as far as the group stage in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025/group-stage" target="_blank">Paris</a>.</p>

<p>&#34;After 3 incredible years with RRQ, I&#39;ve made the difficult decision that I&#39;ll be taking a temporary break from full time coaching,&#34; Ewok <a href="https://x.com/CoachEwok/status/1978796336138125498" target="_blank">said</a>. &#34;Its been some of the most amazing years of my life and I would like to thank everyone involved from the bottom of my heart. I&#39;ll still be in and around Valorant in different ways. This won&#39;t be the end of my coaching career, but rather a break to focus on some other areas of my life.&#34;</p>
