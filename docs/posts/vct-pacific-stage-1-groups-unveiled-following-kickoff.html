		<p>After the conclusion of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2683/vct-2026-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">VCT Pacific Kickoff</a> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/595659/rex-regum-qeon-vs-paper-rex-vct-2026-pacific-kickoff-lbf" target="_blank">Lower Final</a>, an on-stage draw was held to unveil the groups for VCT Pacific Stage 1.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/624080/vct-americas-stage-1-groups-drawn" target="_blank">Americas draw</a>, the region&#39;s 12 teams were split into six pools sorted by their Kickoff placement, with one team from each pool drawn into Group Alpha and the other into Group Omega.</p>

<p>The draw was as follows:</p>









<p>The draw brings forward a handful of eye-catching matchups. In Group Alpha, a grudge match between head coaches is promised when DRX and Global Esports meet in a group that will have four different Pacific champions competing. In Group Omega, all three of the region&#39;s Japan-based orgs will clash against each other, while T1 and RRQ will meet in a rematch of the Middle Final.</p>

<p>Stage 1 is set to begin on April 3, with the group stage set to run until May 17. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/605406/vct-pacific-takes-to-vietnam-for-stage-1-finals" target="_blank">Finals weekend</a> is set to take place in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, bringing a VCT event to the country for the first time ever.</p>
