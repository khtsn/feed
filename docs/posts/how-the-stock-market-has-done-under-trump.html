    <h1>How the Stock Market Has Done Under Trump</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This time around, investors have been shaken by the Trump administration’s messaging on tariffs. What at first seemed to some like a talking point or a negotiation tactic has started to take effect, in fits and starts, as policy.</p><p>Mr. Trump has reiterated his commitment to sweeping tariffs on America’s largest trading partners but has been uneven about imposing them, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-tariff-european-union-whiskey.html" title="">announcing new levies</a> on some products while delaying or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-canada-tariffs-metal.html" title="">abruptly calling off</a> others.</p><p>The market turmoil of the past few weeks is a reflection of the uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump’s policies, and their potential effects on the broader economy. The worry is that consumers may be hesitant to spend, and businesses to invest, in the face of the uncertainty, driving the economy into a downturn.</p><p>And Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees are also looming.</p><p>The Trump administration has seemingly acknowledged that its economic policies could result in near-term pain, while emphasizing their goal of promoting long-term job growth. Asked if he expected a recession this year in an interview that aired on Sunday, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/trump-recession-lutnick.html" title="">declined to rule out</a> the possibility.</p><p>“I hate to predict things like that,” he responded. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.”</p></div></div>
