</span> to earn the right to challenge BBL for the last Paris slot. </p>



<p>With the Champions qualification race coming down to the wire, this match was set to determine the region&#39;s third representative between BBL and Heretics. Ultimately, Liquid barely survived a chaotic 2-1 encounter against BBL, securing a spot in the grand final and qualifying Heretics to Champions based on points. Now down to the lower bracket, BBL will have to secure the remaining grand final spot in order to qualify.</p>

<p>“I don&#39;t think we deserved it,” <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/29873/benjyfishy">
		benjyfishy	</a>
</span> commented after the match on qualifying thanks to Liquid. “We&#39;ve gotten a second chance now, and we&#39;ve just gotta prove that we did deserve…this opportunity that we got.” </p>

<p>The showdown began on BBL&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530932/bbl-esports-vs-team-liquid-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-ubf/?game=231412&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Ascent</a>, where they brought back their distinct triple Initiator composition that stumped <span data-ref-id="6">

</span> and Heretics last week. Liquid, however, were well-prepared against BBL&#39;s fast mid splits, shutting them down to take an early 5-0 lead. A timeout from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/30280/pal">
		PAL	</a>
</span> helped BBL recover and draw it back to 7-5 in favor of Liquid at the half.</p>

<p>BBL took the second pistol after a 2v4 from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/20144/lewn">
		LewN	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9780/jamppi">
		Jamppi	</a>
</span> to make the score 7-7. From there, the map was neck-and-neck as a 9-8 lead for BBL turned into an 11-9 and then 11-10 for Liquid. Round 22 was the pivotal one as <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2168/trexx">
		trexx	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/457/nats">
		nAts	</a>
</span> won out a 2v2 to get Liquid up to 12, allowing them to win the map 13-10.</p>

<p>nAts led his team by example with 23 kills to 13 deaths and 180 ADR on Cypher. <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/309/patitek">
		paTiTek	</a>
</span>, in part spurred on by the support of his former teammates on Heretics, also delivered a strong performance on KAY/O with 21 kills to 16 deaths, 13 assists, and 162 ADR. </p>

<p>The next map of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530932/bbl-esports-vs-team-liquid-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-ubf/?game=231413&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a> threw the rest of the series into chaos, starting with an unthinkable 1v3 full stick defuse from <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2173/magnum">
		MAGNUM	</a>
</span> to win the round 2 eco.</p>


<p><em>MAGNUM gets away with highway robbery.</em></p>

<p>The rest of the half was filled with similarly shocking rounds, including another full stick in round 4 after <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11494/keiko">
		Keiko	</a>
</span> couldn&#39;t fire his Showstopper at the defuser in time and a hero Guardian round from <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/5568/sociablee">
		sociablEE	</a>
</span> in round 6, propelling BBL to an 8-4 half. </p>

<p>Liquid attempted to mount a comeback, winning a bonus round to draw things at 8-8, but a 1v2 clutch from sociablEE in round 19 enabled his team to close it 13-10. </p>

<p>sociablEE was near-invincible throughout the entire map, delivering a monstrous 36 kills, 411 ACS, 256 ADR, and a 2.02 rating. No other player on his team came away from the map with a positive K/D ratio. </p>

<p>Everything came down to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530932/bbl-esports-vs-team-liquid-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-ubf/?game=231414&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, where BBL brought out a new composition with LewN on Iso and sociablEE on Yoru. BBL seemed to be running away with the first half at first, converting the bonus and exploiting Liquid&#39;s B defense to go up 7-3, but a timeout from the Liquid camp helped them get to 7-5 at the half.</p>

<p>The second half was a desperate battle. BBL took the pistol round, but Liquid responded with an eco and a 1v2 from nAts to tie things up at eight rounds apiece. From there, almost every round was a highlight, including a BBL eco round in round 17, LewN sprinting through Keiko&#39;s Orbital Strike to win a 1v1 on three HP in round 18, a close 1v2 from trexx in round 21, and a surprise Guardian 3K from LewN in round 23 to get BBL up to 12.</p>


<p><em>LewN disrespects Keiko&#39;s Orbital Strike to win the 1v1 with three HP remaining.</em></p>

<p>In the final hour, the veteran nAts came alive, pulling off an ace in the final round of regulation to force overtime and taking his team over the line to win 14-12. The in-game leader ended the map with 30 kills to 18 deaths and 223 ADR on his signature Viper pick. </p>


<p><em>nAts pulls an ace out of nowhere when his team needs it the most.</em></p>

<p>“I hope it was [enjoyable] to see the game, at least from the fans&#39; view,” nAts said in the post-match interview regarding the tumultuous match. He and the rest of his team will await the winner of BBL versus GIANTX in the grand final on Sunday to compete for the regional crown.</p>



<p>Both GIANTX and NAVI had carved impressive Cinderella runs through the lower bracket, but one of them had to end in a rematch of their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530925/giantx-vs-natus-vincere-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-ur1" target="_blank">upper round 1</a> confrontation, where GIANTX won 2-1. In the end, GIANTX reasserted their superiority over NAVI and now stand one win away from qualifying to an international event for the first time since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1657/valorant-champions-2023/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions 2023</a>. </p>

<p>NAVI opened with their pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530933/giantx-vs-natus-vincere-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr3/?game=231415&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Icebox</a>, a map they were undefeated on this stage. The entire game was a convincing shutout as NAVI coasted to a 4-0, and then a 7-1, and then a 9-3 lead. Even GIANTX&#39;s third round only came about as a result of a 1v3 from <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/34684/westside">
		westside	</a>
</span>. </p>

<p>A pistol in favor of GIANTX in the second half prolonged the map, but NAVI regained control to win the map 13-6 with little difficulty. As expected, <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/18677/ruxic">
		Ruxic	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/29867/hiro">
		hiro	</a>
</span> continued to put up numbers, the former going 20/10/4 with 174 ADR and the latter going 19/8/3 with 179 ADR. </p>

<p>Next up was GIANTX&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530933/giantx-vs-natus-vincere-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr3/?game=231416&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a>. NAVI took an early 4-2 lead as key duels went their way, but GIANTX found answers later in the half, winning five rounds interrupted only by a 1v2 from Ruxic to take a 7-5 lead. </p>

<p>After winning a second pistol thanks to a 2v4 from westside and Cloud, GIANTX snowballed through the rest of the map on their attack side, dismantling NAVI&#39;s defense and taking the map 13-6. </p>


<p><em>westside and Cloud make a 2v4 situation look easy.</em></p>

<p><span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11332/ara">
		ara	</a>
</span> ran circles around the opponent on Neon with 23 kills and 214 ADR, while <span data-ref-id="20">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4181/cloud">
		Cloud	</a>
</span> on Sova scored 20 kills and 163 ADR. Notably, Cloud repeatedly shut down <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/25906/alexiiik">
		alexiiik	</a>
</span>&#39;s entries, finding six out of his seven first kills against NAVI&#39;s Duelist. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530933/giantx-vs-natus-vincere-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr3/?game=231417&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a> was the decider. When these two teams previously met in the upper bracket, GIANTX picked Haven and won 13-8, leaving NAVI to demonstrate that they had found answers since then. </p>

<p>Instead, the map was even more dominant than last time in favor of GIANTX. ara ran rampant on the defense side with both the rifle and the Operator on Neon, finding eight Operator kills over the course of the map. Combined with proactive pushes, strong retakes, and sharp headshots from westside, GIANTX forged ahead to a 9-3 lead at the half.</p>


<p><em>westside finds the gap and lands three Sheriff kills to win the Thrifty.</em></p>

<p>A second pistol for GIANTX for five pistol wins in the series sealed NAVI&#39;s fate as they quickly closed out Haven 13-4. ara ended with 19 kills to go 56/28/5 over the course of the match, while westside followed close behind with 17 kills on Haven and a 51/35/13 KDA for the series. </p>

<p>“Compared to before, we were not fully confident in ourselves…now we are coming on the stage with [a] different attitude. We are coming and in our heads already winners,” said westside when asked about GIANTX&#39;s mindset in the group stage compared to playoffs.</p>

<p>VCT EMEA will return tomorrow with a year-defining <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530934/bbl-esports-vs-giantx-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lbf" target="_blank">lower bracket final</a> between BBL and GIANTX. The winner will claim the final Champions berth; the loser will go home with nothing.</p>
