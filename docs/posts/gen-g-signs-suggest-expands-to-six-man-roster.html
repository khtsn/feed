</span>. Suggest hit the ground running with DFM in 2022. Across <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/stats/997/champions-tour-japan-stage-2-challengers-week-1" target="_blank">Week 1</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/stats/1012/champions-tour-japan-stage-2-challengers-week-2" target="_blank">Week 2</a> of Japanese Challengers Stage 2, he was rated as one of the competition&#39;s best players. In Week 1, he had the fourth-highest rating, and the highest kill-to-death ratio of any player. In Week 2, he had the competition&#39;s highest rating and second-highest kill-to-death ratio. Despite this success, DFM was not able to qualify for an international event in 2022.</p>

<p>As Valorant entered its franchising era in 2023, DFM was selected as a partnered organization. However, Suggest&#39;s role on the team changed. He started the year as the team&#39;s duelist, but that changed as he picked up the sentinel and then the initiator roles to end the year. That season, he competed in seven of DFM&#39;s ten matches throughout the Pacific season, including <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1191/champions-tour-2023-pacific-league/league-play" target="_blank">league play</a> and the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1660/champions-tour-2023-pacific-last-chance-qualifier/main-event" target="_blank">Last Chance Qualifier</a>.</p>

<p>Suggest was <a href="https://x.com/DFM_VALORANT/status/1754459877135757462" target="_blank">released</a> by DFM in 2023 after just over two years with the organization, and <a href="https://x.com/Suggest5811/status/1754472493799325803" target="_blank">shared</a> that he would take a break for the near future. His arrival to Gen.G marks his return to professional Valorant after over a year on the sidelines.</p>

<p>Suggest and Ash&#39;s additions bring a sense of familiarity for Gen.G&#39;s coaching staff. While Ash is an internal promotion, Suggest has had playing experience with the coaching staff. Head coach <span data-ref-id="11">
