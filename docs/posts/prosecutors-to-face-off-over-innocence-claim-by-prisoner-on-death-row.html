But the hearing on Wednesday in St. Louis County will be the first time that a court will consider DNA evidence that could exonerate him.</p><p>The case is notable because it has put two law enforcement officials, the local prosecutor and the state attorney general, on opposite sides. The prosecutor, Wesley Bell, supports Mr. Williams’s bid for exoneration and has filed a 63-page motion to overturn his conviction. The attorney general, Andrew Bailey, has argued that Wednesday’s hearing should not even take place.</p><p>Mr. Bell, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/politics/cori-bush-wesley-bell-primary.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">recently defeated</a> U.S. Representative Cori Bush in the Democratic primary for her House seat in a heavily Democratic district, so he will very likely be heading to Congress in January. Mr. Bailey, a Republican who was appointed to his office midterm to fill a vacancy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/politics/andrew-bailey-missouri-attorney-general.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">fended off</a> a primary challenge this month and is also likely to win the general election in the deeply red state.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In his short time in office, Mr. Bailey has opposed three wrongful-conviction claims, going so far as to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/missouri-andrew-bailey-exonerated.html" title="">try to keep people in prison</a> after they have been exonerated. In the Williams case, he has asked both the trial court and the State Supreme Court to block the hearing.</p><p>Tricia Rojo Bushnell, executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project, which is representing Mr. Williams, said Mr. Bailey’s efforts were costly and counterproductive. “Especially if there’s an execution date, we should absolutely want this evidence to be heard,” she said. “But instead we’re going to use all of these resources, all of our state resources, to try to prevent a hearing from even happening.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Williams was convicted of killing a woman in 1998. He has long maintained his innocence.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Marcellus Williams legal team</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Williams, 55, was convicted of killing Felicia Gayle, a well-known reporter for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, during a 1998 burglary of her home in a gated community in University City, a St. Louis suburb.</p><p>Ms. Gayle was stabbed more than 43 times with a kitchen knife, according to court filings. The crime scene yielded bloody shoe prints, bloody fingerprints and hairs believed to belong to the perpetrator that were collected from Ms. Gayle’s T-shirt, hands and the floor. Ms. Gayle’s purse and her husband’s laptop were missing.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Bell has argued that new DNA evidence and other facts cast “inexorable doubt” on the conviction. Mr. Williams has been excluded as the source of the shoe prints, fingerprints and hairs, and DNA testing found another man’s DNA on the knife. Mr. Bell also said that Mr. Williams’s lawyer at trial presented no evidence of his troubled background, which might have spared him from a death sentence, and that the prosecutor improperly struck Black potential jurors from the jury pool.</p><p>Mr. Bell’s <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024.01.26-First-Motion-to-Vacate_Filestamped.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">motion to overturn the conviction</a> was made under a 2021 law that allows prosecutors to challenge past convictions if they believe the person is innocent or was convicted in error. The law says that when a prosecutor brings such a motion, the circuit court “shall” hold a hearing and issue “findings of fact and conclusions of law.”</p><p>But Mr. Bailey has argued that the hearing should not go forward because the State Supreme Court has “exclusive authority to review death sentences,” and that court has already heard and denied each of Mr. Williams’s claims.</p><p>For many months after Ms. Gayle’s death, the police were unable to identify a suspect, even after the family offered a $10,000 reward. Almost a year after the killing, though, a man who had just been released from jail told the police that he had been Mr. Williams’s cellmate and had heard him confess to the killing.</p><p>The police then arrested Mr. Williams’s girlfriend on outstanding warrants, told her about the reward money and promised to help with her warrants if she provided information about the killing, according to Mr. Bell’s motion. The prosecution’s case ultimately depended on testimony from the two witnesses.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In the motion, Mr. Bell outlined what he said were significant problems with both witnesses’ credibility, including accounts that changed over time and details that contradicted the physical evidence. Both had incentives to testify, Mr. Bell wrote. The former cellmate, Henry Cole, refused to cooperate fully until he had received a portion of the reward money, typically distributed only at the conclusion of a case.</p><p>One of the few things tying Mr. Williams to the crime was the fact that he sold the stolen laptop. The jury was not permitted to hear testimony that Mr. Williams had mentioned receiving the laptop from his girlfriend, who became a witness against him, because the testimony could have been considered hearsay, which is permitted as evidence only under very limited circumstances.</p><p>Mr. Williams has long maintained his innocence. In 2015, the State Supreme Court issued a stay of execution in his case to allow for DNA testing of the murder weapon. A special master oversaw the testing, which the lab said was inconclusive.</p><p>In 2017, Mr. Williams’s execution was again halted by Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, who empaneled a board of retired judges to review the case. But Mr. Greitens left office before that inquiry was complete; his successor, Mike Parson, also a Republican, disbanded the panel in June 2023, and Mr. Bailey immediately asked that an execution date be set.</p><p>Mr. Williams’s lawyers say that experts have reviewed the DNA test results and found that they exclude him.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shaila Dewan covers criminal justice — policing, courts and prisons — across the country.
