But Russia and Ukraine have been holding firm, and neither was expected to present terms that are acceptable to the other side.</p><p>The talks — which took place at a five-star hotel on the shore of the Bosporus and lasted less than two hours — came a day after Russia and Ukraine exchanged some of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/world/europe/russia-ukraine-strikes.html" title="">most intense air attacks of the war</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Here’s what you need to know about the cease-fire talks:</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5a41c0ae">What happened in the first round?</h2><p>At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">the first Istanbul meeting</a> in mid-May, both sides agreed to conduct a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-prisoner-swap.html" title="">large prisoner swap</a>, — and to write up and share with each other the conditions for a possible cease-fire.</p><p>After those talks, Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia spoke for about two hours by phone. Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-cease-fire.html" title="">backed off his demand</a> that Russia declare an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine, instead endorsing Mr. Putin’s call for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olena Nehir embraces her husband Oleksandr Nehir after his release from Russian captivity in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Putin made it clear that he was not budging from his demands and that Russia was not on the verge of declaring a cease-fire. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump later told reporters that he expected to see progress in the talks soon, but that if he did not, he was “just going to back away.” Then, after a Russian attack on Kyiv, Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Putin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/us/politics/trump-putin.html" title="">saying</a> that “he has gone absolutely CRAZY” and that Mr. Trump was considering imposing additional sanctions on Russia. So far, Mr. Trump has not acted on any of his threats.</p><h2 id="link-4260b111">What’s at stake?</h2><p>The largest land war in Europe since World War II, which began after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, has taken a heavy toll in lives, physical destruction and economic hardship. It has prompted much of the West to isolate Russia diplomatically and commercially, while also undermining European economies.</p><p>Both Ukraine and Russia have been maneuvering to set the terms and tempo of peace negotiations, while simultaneously trying to win over the White House amid its threats to abandon talks altogether.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky wants an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, followed by negotiations over a potential peace deal. But Mr. Putin, who appears confident of Russia’s upper hand on the battlefield, is refusing to stop fighting before he secures major concessions from Kyiv and the West.</p><p>Mr. Putin also wants to keep the attention of Mr. Trump, who is promising a new era of warm ties between Moscow and Washington, and to convince the White House that he is not stonewalling the peace in Ukraine that Mr. Trump promised as a presidential candidate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But the Russian leader is also still seeking Ukraine’s capitulation, both on the battlefield and in negotiations, after more than three years of full-scale war that has come to define his rule.</p><h2 id="link-3bb75ee4">What is Russia’s position?</h2><p>When Mr. Putin and other Russian leaders talk about ending the war, they focus on what they call the “root causes” of the conflict — Kremlin shorthand for a range of issues including the existence of Ukraine as a fully independent and sovereign nation aligned with the West.</p><p>Specifically, the Kremlin says it wants control over five Ukrainian territories, including large areas of land it has failed to seize despite the years of war. Mr. Putin has also demanded that Ukraine agree to strict limitations on its military, and to not join NATO. </p><p>From the start, the Istanbul negotiations were not expected to yield any huge breakthroughs. But the meetings have served as a tactical win for Mr. Putin, who managed to start the talks without first agreeing to the cease-fire that Ukraine and almost all of its Western backers had sought as a precondition for negotiations.</p><h2 id="link-2afc7a7a">What is Ukraine’s position?</h2><p>Ahead of Monday’s talks, Kyiv said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/europe/ukraine-russia-peace-talks.html?searchResultPosition=13" title="">submitted its own peace terms</a> to both Russia and the United States. But Russia said it would only share its memorandum during the new round of negotiations, prompting Ukraine to accuse it of slow-walking the peace process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Kyiv’s goal remains to secure a cease-fire first, before moving to negotiations for a broader peace deal. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, said its proposals included provisions for a cease-fire on land, at sea and in the air, with monitoring to be carried out by international partners.</p><p>With Russia holding the initiative on the front for more than 16 months, many Ukrainians have concluded that they are unlikely to drive the Russians off their lands militarily. And so Ukraine wants to freeze the fighting where it is and then make a case that any formal recognition of Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian lands would violate basic tenets of international law and set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>Ukraine has also said it will not accept any limitations on its military. </p><h2 id="link-44a26ae5">Who are the negotiators?</h2><p>The composition of the delegations — mostly government officials with limited political leverage — suggested that Monday’s discussions remained technical in nature.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who in recent days dampened expectations for the discussions, said on Monday that Kyiv’s delegation in Istanbul was “ready to take the necessary steps for peace” in talks with Russia.” But if the Istanbul talks yield nothing, Mr. Zelensky added, “strong, new sanctions are urgently, urgently needed” from both the European Union and from the United States.</p><p>Kyiv’s <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/3592025-55161" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14-member delegation</a> was led by the Ukrainian defense minister, Rustem Umerov.</p><p>Russia’s delegation was led by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Mr. Putin. After the previous round of talks, Mr. Medinsky, a conservative historian, told Russian state television that “as a rule, as Napoleon said, war and negotiations take place at the same time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-2e45a1eb">What is happening on the battlefield?</h2><p>As negotiations sputter, attacks on the battlefield have intensified. The Russian army appears to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-offensive.html" title="">launching a new offensive</a>, advancing at the fastest pace since last fall and opening a new front in the northern Sumy region. It has also bombarded Ukrainian cities with some of the biggest drone and missile attacks of the war, including a barrage of 500 drones and decoys on Sunday.</p><p>Ukraine, for its part, has adapted and evolved in the face of a much larger military with deeper resources. Ukrainian drones, in an ambitious, coordinated attack, struck air bases deep inside Russia this weekend.</p><p>Erica L.
