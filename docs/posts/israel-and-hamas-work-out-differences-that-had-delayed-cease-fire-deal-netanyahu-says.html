Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s hard-line national security minister, threatened to resign and remove his party from the Israeli government if the cabinet voted to approve the provisional cease-fire deal.</p><p>“This deal would effectively erase the achievements of the war,” said Mr. Ben-Gvir, adding that the cease-fire would leave Hamas in power in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While Mr. Ben-Gvir’s threat could destabilize Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition at a critical time, it was unlikely to scuttle the cease-fire deal, which would also free hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Mr. Netanyahu would still command a majority of 62 seats in the 120-member Parliament.</p><p>Opposition lawmakers have pledged to support Mr. Netanyahu’s push for a cease-fire if more hard-line allies leave the coalition. “This is more important than all the differences of opinion that there have ever been between us,” said Yair Lapid, the leader of the parliamentary opposition.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s announcement suggests that a cease-fire could still come into effect by this weekend. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken had said on Thursday that he was confident the agreement would go into effect as planned on Sunday.</p><p>President Biden and other mediators announced on Wednesday that Israeli and Hamas negotiators in Qatar had reached a deal to stop the fighting and free hostages held in Gaza. The difficulties on Thursday underscored the volatility of the truce and prompted fears of further delays.</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump, who had pressured the parties to reach an agreement before his inauguration on Monday, repeated his warning that he wanted the deal closed <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/trump-warns-hostage-deal-better-be-done-before-i-take-the-oath-of-office-on-monday/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">before he took office</a> in a podcast interview on Thursday. He told the host, Dan Bongino, that “it better be done.” In December, weeks after he was re-elected, Mr. Trump said there would be “hell to pay” if a cease-fire and hostage deal was not reached.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
