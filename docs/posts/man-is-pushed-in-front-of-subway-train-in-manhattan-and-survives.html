He was in critical but stable condition several hours later.</p><p>Officers detained a man for questioning shortly after the attack, the police said. The man, who had not been arrested or charged, was being held at the Police Department’s Transit District 1 at the 59th Street-Columbus Circle subway station. The police had not identified the man or the shoving victim as of Tuesday evening.</p><p>Video of the attack, which happened around 1:30 p.m., shows a man in an orange jacket who appears to be looking down at his phone while standing near the edge of the southbound platform at the 18th Street No. 1 station.</p><p>A person in a dark coat is then seen passing behind the man in the orange jacket before doubling back and shoving him forcefully off the platform and into the path of a southbound train.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://x.com/VioletPaley/status/1874170540673687979/video/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Other videos posted to social media</a> appear to show a group of firefighters pulling the man out from between train cars and onto the platform. As he lies flat on the floor, his hand moves slightly. “He’s alive!” one person exclaims.</p><p>Emergency services workers responded to the scene, stabilized the man and put him on a stretcher, according to the Fire Department. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, the police said.</p><p>Power to the tracks was shut off in the area for an hour, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. Service resumed a little before 4 p.m.</p><p>Dale Roberts, 75, got off a southbound 1 at the station around that time on his way home from work. He said he had moved to the city in 1974 and was not surprised that someone had been shoved in front of a moving train there.</p><p>“There’s a real sense of more than just kind of precautionary sensibilities,” he said of the general mood he detected among passengers these days. “There starts to become an embedded fear. And that’s not good for the city or the riders in general.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Roberts said he felt that many of those who committed violent acts in the subway were seriously troubled and unable to get the care they needed. “They just need to be removed” from the system and put in a facility of some kind, he said.</p><p>“You could be laissez-faire about things,” he said, “but at a certain point, public safety, quality of life and these issues start to come to the forefront. And if that starts to deteriorate, the city as it is, is just going to fall.”</p><p>A short time later, Steven Schmatz and Riyu Banerjee got off an uptown train at the station, which is close to Mr. Schmatz’s home. They said they just been talking about the shoving attack and were shocked to learned that it had happened at 18th Street.</p><p>“I’ve never felt unsafe here,” Mr. Schmatz said. “That’s crazy.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve seen any major incidents since I’ve lived in New York for the past seven years,” he added. “I’ve seen antisocial behavior, but I haven’t seen anything super dangerous. It does seem like there’s been an uptick recently.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alyce-mcfadden">More about Alyce McFadden</a></span></p></div><div><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius is a criminal justice reporter for The Times, covering the New York Police Department.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chelsia-rose-marcius">More about Chelsia Rose Marcius</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/ny-metropolitan-transportation-authority">N.Y.
