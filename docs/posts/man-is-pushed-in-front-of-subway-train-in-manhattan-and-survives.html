    <h1>Man Is Pushed in Front of Subway Train in Manhattan and Survives</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A man waiting on a subway platform was violently shoved into the path of an oncoming train in Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon, the police said. He is in critical but stable condition.</p><p>Officers brought a man in for questioning shortly after the incident, the police said. The man, who has not been arrested or charged in the shoving, was being held at a police office inside the 59th Street-Columbus Circle station.</p><p>Video of the attack, which happened around 1:30 p.m., shows a man in an orange jacket standing near the edge of the platform at the 18th Street No. 1 station in Chelsea. He appears to be looking down at a cellphone. A person in a dark coat passes behind him before doubling back and shoving him hard off the edge of the platform. Seconds later, a southbound No. 1 train speeds into the station.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/VioletPaley/status/1874170540673687979/video/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Videos posted to social media</a> appear to show a group of firefighters pulling the man onto the platform from in between train cars. As he lies flat on the floor, his hand moves slightly. “He’s alive!” an onlooker exclaims.</p></div></div>
