Seconds later, a southbound No. 1 train speeds into the station.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/VioletPaley/status/1874170540673687979/video/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Videos posted to social media</a> appear to show a group of firefighters pulling the man onto the platform from in between train cars.
