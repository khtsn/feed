No serious injuries have been reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/03/18/surge-in-tesla-protests-5-teslas-damaged-in-targeted-attack-in-las-vegas/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Five more vehicles at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas</a> were damaged on Tuesday in what the local authorities said was a targeted attack.</p><p>“The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism,” Ms. Bondi wrote in a statement. “We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There is no stand-alone federal domestic terrorism law that includes penalties, although it is defined under federal statute, so those charged in the attacks would be charged under other federal laws. Ms. Bondi did not specify what charges could be brought, but she said that if convicted, some of those accused could face sentences of at least five years in prison.</p><p>Ms. Bondi’s remarks echoed President Trump’s labeling of the vandalism as terrorism. On Tuesday, he baselessly suggested in a Fox interview that the vandalism was paid for “by people very highly political on the left.”</p><p>Congressional Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, have pressured Ms. Bondi to call such attacks domestic terrorism — after successfully resisting efforts by Democrats in 2022 to pass legislation to counter the rise in activity by white supremacists and other far-right groups.</p><p>Ms. Bondi supported Mr. Trump’s mass clemency for hundreds of his supporters who violently ransacked the U.S. Capitol, including some who assaulted police officers. The F.B.I. described those involved in the planning and perpetration of that attack as <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/examining-the-january-6-attack-on-the-us-capitol-wray-061521" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“domestic violent extremists,”</a> whom they had previously identified in threat assessments.</p><p>Several Tesla facilities have been targeted in the past several days.</p><p>On Monday, police arrested a 26-year-old woman with spraypainting anti-Musk messages on the front windows of a Tesla facility in Buffalo Grove, Ill., on Friday. That same day vandals <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/03/17/encinitas-tesla-dealership-vandalized-with-swastikas-smashed-windows/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke windows and defaced a dealership</a> in the San Diego area with swastikas and slogans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, working with the local police, are investigating vandalism of Cybertrucks at a Tesla dealership in Kansas City, Mo., the F.B.I.’s Kansas City field office said in a statement posted to Facebook. An unknown attacker fired more than a dozen shots at a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Ore., last week, damaging some of the vehicles and store windows.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Deportations:</strong> The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-venezuela-deportations-doj-court-order.html">asked a federal judge to dissolve the orders he put in place</a> barring it from deporting suspected members of a Venezuelan street gang from the country under a rarely invoked wartime statute called the Alien Enemies Act.</p></li><li><p><strong>Medical Research at Columbia:</strong> Dozens of medical and scientific studies are ending or at risk of ending, leaving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/nyregion/columbia-research-grants-trump.html">researchers scrambling to find alternative funding</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Military Academies:</strong> President Trump moved to stack the boards overseeing U.S. military service academies with conservative activists and political allies, including Michael T.
