It was unclear how many of those drones had been intercepted by other means, such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/europe/us-weapons-russia-jamming-ukraine.html" title="">electronic interference</a>, and how many had struck targets.</p><p>Some critical infrastructure was hit and residential buildings were damaged in several regions, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Damage to the power grid in Ternopil, a city in western Ukraine, caused electricity and water outages, <a href="https://t.me/V_Negoda_TODA/1273" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the local authorities said</a>.</p><p>Russia’s military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drones.html" title="">attacked Ukrainian cities with waves of drones</a> almost every night since September in a campaign that analysts say is intended to test and wear down air defenses. The drones have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-power-grid.html" title="">targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure</a> in a renewed effort to plunge the population into cold and darkness as winter sets in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The overnight drone assault, however, stood out for its sheer scale. It came as both Ukraine and Russia have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/podcasts/the-daily/ukraine-missiles-trump.html" title="">stepping up tit-for-tat air attacks</a> over the past week.</p><p>Last Tuesday, Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia-atacms-missiles.html" title="">struck deep inside Russia with U.S.-made missiles</a> for the first time. Moscow vowed to respond and test fired an intermediate-range missile designed to deliver nuclear weapons, though it was not armed with nuclear warheads. The strikes represented a demonstration of force by both sides and shifted the focus away from ground assaults to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missiles.html" title="">a Cold War-style missile brinkmanship</a>.</p><p>On Tuesday, ambassadors from Ukraine and NATO’s member states were set to discuss a possible response to Russia’s use of the intermediate-range missile, which was fired at the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine. The strike caused little damage, but it raised alarm in Ukraine at a time when Moscow has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/world/europe/russia-missile-threat-reactions.html" title="">elevating threats</a> of nuclear war.</p><p>Ukrainian officials were expected to use the Tuesday meeting, to be held in Brussels, to reiterate their requests for allies to send more air-defense systems to counter Russian attacks.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/world/europe/ukraine-missile-defenses.html" title="">Months of Russian drone and missile bombardments</a> have depleted Ukraine’s air defenses. In recent weeks, Russian drones have increasingly penetrated central Kyiv, home to government administration buildings and the presidential palace. The once rare buzz of drones flying overhead at night and the rat-tat-tat of heavy machine guns trying to take them down now echo regularly through the heart of the capital.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
