    <h1>Nova secures playoffs, Bilibili keeps winning in Stage 1</h1>

		<p>The fourth week of VCT China 2025 Stage 1 saw many close series between teams fighting for their playoff lives. Bilibili Gaming stretched their undefeated run in Stage 1 to 4-0, while EDward Gaming, Nova Esports, and Xi Lai Gaming all scrapped their way to series wins. Group Omega has its four playoff teams already solved, while Group Alpha remains competitive heading into the final week of the Stage 1 regular season.</p>

<p>Here is how the penultimate week of VCT China 2025 Stage 1 turned out:</p>



<p>Group Omega&#39;s playoff qualification ended in week four, with Trace Esports, Xi Lai Gaming, and Wolves Esports all earning their playoff spot with the outcome of their matches. Despite losing a tight three-map series to XLG, Trace still earned their spot by winning a map. Plus, the team stacked a great round differential in their earlier games, making their worst possible finish still rank above both JDG Esports and All Gamers.</p>

<p>Nova will fight EDG for the top slot in Group Alpha, but they secured the first playoff slot for the group with their map and round differential. Their 2-1 win over TYLOO started worryingly but quickly shifted into a stomp, with <span data-ref-id="12">

</span> stepping up on map three to confidently secure that playoff spot. EDG kept their new signing and sixth man <span data-ref-id="13">

</span>, and similarly to Nova, had a tough map one followed by two strong maps to win their series over TEC.</p>

<p>DRG swept FPX to further complicate the playoff picture in Group Alpha, with TEC joining them at a 2-2 record. However, the week&#39;s statement win belonged to BLG with their victory over Wolves in a tight battle. It didn&#39;t end up changing either team&#39;s Stage 1 playoff hopes, but their dominance on Haven and Ascent was notable. While <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4885/whzy">

</span> did get a lot of kills, the highest match rating on BLG belonged to <span data-ref-id="16">

</span>.</p>

<p>However, neither of them are the player of the week. That belongs to <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3741/vo0kashu">

</span> of DRG, who led his team flexing from Sentinel to Duelist and topped the week&#39;s match rating with 1.70. In that sweep, vo0kashu had 50 kills, 325 ACS, and an absurd 220 ADR.</p>

</span> from TYLOO fighting hard in his series loss.</p>

<p>As for playoffs, Group Omega is only fighting for seeding, as their top four teams have qualified for the playoff stage of Stage 1. Nova is the only team officially in the playoffs from Group Alpha, as every other team aside from TYLOO could fall in or out based on the final week of the Stage 1 regular season.</p>

<p>Here are the upcoming matches for the fifth week of VCT China 2025 Stage 1:</p>
