It said the two trips, both of which had been previously unknown to the public, took place in 2021 and were provided by Harlan Crow, a real estate magnate in Texas and a frequent patron of Justice Thomas’s.</p><p>One trip took place that July by private jet from Nebraska to Saranac, N.Y., where Justice Thomas stayed at Mr. Crow’s upstate retreat for five days. The other came in October, when Mr. Crow flew Justice Thomas round trip from the District of Columbia to New Jersey for <a href="https://jerseycatholic.org/beloved-franciscan-sister-a-life-long-mentor-of-justice-thomas-honored-with-new-jersey-cemetery-statue" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the dedication of a statue</a>, including hosting him overnight in New York on his yacht.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The disclosures were one of the few new revelations in a report that otherwise largely summarized information about largess accepted by justices — and failures to disclose it — that had already become public.
