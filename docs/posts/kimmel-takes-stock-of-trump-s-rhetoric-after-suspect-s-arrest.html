I can use it too, far better than they can, but I don’t.’ Right, you are nothing if not a calming influence.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“This is a man who, for the past week, has been spreading a complete lie that he knows is a lie, saying Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. This is a man who, just last week, joked about Nancy Pelosi’s 84-year-old husband being brutally attacked with a hammer by one of his deranged fans. This is a man who, literally hours before this happened, posted on Truth Social the words ‘I hate Taylor Swift.’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-156c6df9">The Punchiest Punchlines (Real Fake News Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“During a new interview, JD Vance admitted that he created the false claim about immigrants eating pets to create media attention.

The only way to expose the truth is to spread a lie. It’s the power of storytelling.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Yep, Vance admitted that he made the whole thing up, but besides being overtly racist and making Trump look like a total fool at the debate, no harm done, right?” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Guillermo Rodriguez brought his “Back to Back” segment to the Emmys for Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-102ce59">What We’re Excited About on Tuesday Night</h2></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The comedian Ms. Pat will sit down with Seth Meyers on Tuesday’s “Late Night.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dave Navarro, left, and Perry Farrell performing with Jane’s Addiction in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amy Harris/Invision, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
