Somalia, the first major U.S. military operation overseas since he took office.</p><p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement that the military’s initial assessment was that “multiple operatives” in the remote Golis Mountains in the country’s north were killed in the strikes, and that no civilians were harmed.</p><p>The strikes were conducted by Navy and Air Force warplanes, including F/A-18 fighter jets from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman operating in the Red Sea, three Defense Department officials said.</p><p>“This action further degrades ISIS’s ability to plot and conduct terrorist attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners and innocent civilians,” Mr. Hegseth said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The strikes were more symbolic than substantive, several U.S. military and defense officials said, meant more to burnish Mr. Trump’s image as a commander in chief protecting the country from terrorists in the early days of his administration than to neutralize a serious threat.</p><p>On Thursday, the military’s Central Command said a U.S. airstrike in northwest Syria had killed a senior operative in Hurras al-Din, an Al Qaeda affiliate.</p><p><a href="https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/35701/us-forces-conduct-strike-targeting-isis-somalia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The strikes in Somalia on Saturday</a> were a much larger operation, military officials said, and the fact that Mr. Trump had to approve it meant that at least one of the operatives was probably a senior leader of the Islamic State in the African country.</p><p>Mr. Trump said in a message on social media that the strikes had killed a “Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited” who were “hiding in caves.”</p><p>Somalia, though, is better known as a harbor for Al Shabab, the terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda, than for the Islamic State. U.S. intelligence officials estimate that Al Shabab in Somalia has roughly 7,000 to 12,000 members and an annual income — including from taxing or extorting civilians — of about $120 million, making it the largest and wealthiest Qaeda affiliate in the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>However, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/us/new-orleans-attack-shamsud-din-jabbar-isis.html" title="">an Army veteran’s ISIS-inspired attack</a> in New Orleans on New Year’s Day and amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/middleeast/us-funding-freeze-isis-camps-syria.html" title="">fears of a resurgent Islamic State in Syria</a> after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s government, counterterrorism specialists have warned the new administration that it needs to take such threats seriously.</p><p>“For Trump, this is important to show a muscular response, especially if he plans to draw down U.S. troop levels from conflict zones,” said Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm based in New York.</p><p>President Trump withdrew about 700 U.S. troops from Somalia in January 2021. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/us/politics/biden-military-somalia.html" title="">redeployed around 450</a> of those forces after he took office. It is unclear what Mr. Trump might do this time. Those troops provide training to Somali forces and do not conduct counterterrorism operations, Pentagon officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A U.S. Special Operations commander speaking to Somali soldiers at the military base in Baledogle, Somalia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The strikes on Saturday also aimed to counter critics who say that rushing active-duty troops to the southwestern border to stem the flow of migrants — a top priority for Mr. Trump — could jeopardize other military missions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Hegseth said on Saturday that the United States “stands ready to find and eliminate terrorists who threaten the United States and our allies, even as we conduct robust border-protection” missions.</p><p>To be sure, there are threats in northern Somalia, where the Islamic State operates.</p><p>In May, the military carried out an airstrike against ISIS fighters in a remote area southeast of Bosaso, Somalia, and killed three. Some analysts thought the strike killed a Somali militant believed to be the head of ISIS’s worldwide operations. That assessment proved incorrect, counterterrorism officials said.</p><p>In January 2023, U.S. Special Operations commandos killed a senior Islamic State leader in an early morning helicopter raid in a remote area of northern Somalia.</p><p>The Pentagon identified the leader, one of the terrorist group’s top financial operatives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/us/politics/isis-somalia-kabul-bombing.html" title="">as Bilal al-Sudani</a>. American officials said that he was operating in Somalia but that his influence extended across Africa, into Europe and even to the ISIS branch in Afghanistan that carried out the August 2021 bombing at Kabul’s airport that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/us/politics/kabul-airport-attack-report.html" title="">killed 13 American service members</a>.</p><p>That raid took place in a remote mountainous cave complex in the Puntland region of northern Somalia, months after American spy networks detected Mr. al-Sudani’s hidden headquarters and monitored the location to study his movements.</p><p>The commandos scooped up laptop computers and hard drives, cellphones and other information from Mr. al-Sudani’s hide-out that have provided leads in other counterterrorism operations.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Trump Orders Airstrikes Against ISIS in Somalia<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/islamic-state">Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How the World Is Reeling:</strong> President Trump’s order to halt most foreign aid has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/world/asia/trump-usaid-freeze.html">intensified humanitarian crises and raised questions</a> about the United States’ reliability as a global leader.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk’s Twitter Takeover Tactics:</strong> Federal agencies have offered exits to millions of employees and tested the prowess of engineers — just like when Elon Musk bought Twitter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/technology/musk-doge-x-playbook.html">The similarities have been uncanny</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prosecutors Dismissed:</strong> The Justice Department’s campaign of retribution against officials who investigated Trump and his supporters accelerated with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/prosecutors-us-attorneys-office-trump-firings.html">firing of more than a dozen federal prosecutors at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington</a>, according to a department memo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Bureau Chief Fired:</strong> Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was fired, prematurely ending a five-year term that was scheduled to run through late 2026. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/business/cfpb-rohit-chopra.html">He was known for his aggressive enforcement and expansion of consumer protection laws</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Halt on Climate Spending:</strong> Trump’s order that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/climate/trump-ira-climate-spending-halt-jobs-construction.html">all federal climate spending be paused</a> is paralyzing federal agencies, causing confusion in states and cities, delaying construction projects and forcing some companies to furlough workers.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
