The plane’s pilot reported “mechanical issues” just before the crash, he said, adding that investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were on their way to the scene to investigate.</p><p>Footage from television news showed debris on a set of train tracks beneath a highway overpass. The Boca Raton police said <a href="https://x.com/CityBocaRaton/status/1910707711907365029" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a major section of Interstate 95</a> had been closed near the crash site. Flightradar24, a flight tracking site, <a href="https://x.com/flightradar24/status/1910709999673684000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">captured a dizzying flight pattern</a> as the plane looped and zigzagged around the Boca Raton area. It took off around 10:15 a.m. local time from Boca Raton Airport and was headed to Tallahassee, Fla., according to the site.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The plane, a Cessna 310R built in 1977, was registered to a limited liability company in Delaware, according to a Federal Aviation Administration database. That model seats four to six people. The identities of the victims were not immediately made public.</p><p>An N.T.S.B. spokesman, Peter C. Knudson, said an investigator was at the crash site on Friday afternoon documenting the wreckage, which will be moved to a secure facility for further evaluation.</p><p>As part of the investigation, the agency will review flight data, air traffic control communications, the plane’s maintenance records, weather data, the pilot’s license history and activities in the 72 hours before the crash, witness statements and video footage, including from doorbell cameras. A preliminary report is expected in 30 days, Mr. Knudson said.</p><p>A business manager at the airport said shortly after the crash that the airport had closed because of an “aircraft incident.” The airport, which mainly operates private and charter flights, had reopened by noon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Emergency workers standing near debris from a small plane crash on a set of train tracks." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv/11xp-bocacrash-wjlv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/376a69e3-ca11-59c9-bf6d-fb0304ca1e83" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Three people were killed when a small plane crashed on the Tri-Rail commuter rail tracks in Boca Raton, Fla., on Friday morning, the authorities said.

Planes are restricted to flying least 1,000 feet over congested areas, he said.</p><p>“Even someone with a special flight permit wouldn’t be able to do that type of thing,” he said. “Right then and there I knew something was wrong.”</p><p>Mr. Echeverria did not hear the crash because of his hurricane-proof windows, he said, but the next thing he knew, there was a large black plume of smoke.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Remy Tumin is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news and other topics.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
