Local officials in Kerr County said Sunday that 11 girls and one counselor from Camp Mystic, an all-girls’ Christian summer camp, are still missing.</p><p>On Sunday, near the bank of the Guadalupe in Ingram, the search for survivors grew more desperate as volunteers prepared horses to help search and rescue efforts. Rescuers in Hunt had to work around piles of debris and fast moving water. Flood damage made it difficult for vehicles to reach many areas. The death toll is expected to rise, and more rain fell in areas that were already hard-hit.</p><p>Here’s what we know about those who were killed.</p><h2 id="link-38818c63">Jeff Wilson</h2><p>Jeff Wilson, a longtime high school teacher in suburban Houston, was killed in the flood while camping near the river with his wife, Amber, and their 12-year-old son, Shiloh, according to several friends, people at the school where he worked, and his brother-in-law John Dustin Ledford.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The family had been in the area for the Kerrville Open Pro Rodeo, where his son, a third-generation cowboy, had been set to compete on Friday in the bareback/saddle/mini bronc riding event. As they often did, they had traveled to the rodeo in their truck with a camper set atop it, so they would not have to pay for a hotel.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jeff Wilson</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kathleen Ortiz</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>On social media on Saturday, Mr. Ledford said that he was able to locate the family’s truck in the water, but the family was not in it and the camper was nowhere to be seen. He added that Ms. Wilson and Shiloh are still missing and asked for prayers.</p><p>In a letter emailed on Sunday to the families of students at Kingwood Park High School, where Mr. Wilson taught collision repair and auto body refinishing, and Creekwood Middle School, where Shiloh was a rising seventh-grader, the principals of the two schools said that the community is continuing “to hold onto hope during this incredibly difficult time.”</p><p>Mr. Wilson, 55, had worked in the Humble Independent School District for 30 years and was beloved by students and his colleagues, said Missi Taylor, an architecture teacher whose classroom at Kingwood Park High School was next to Mr. Wilson’s. He was the kind of guy who would do anything to help another teacher or student, she said, including even happily fixing the dings on people’s family cars.</p><p>He also would regale students and teachers with his rodeo past, Ms. Taylor said. His father, Stanley Wilson, is in the Texas Rodeo Hall of Fame, and Jeff also was a successful cowboy: He rode steers, bulls and saddle bronc horses, but was forced to retire in 2004 because of injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident, according to the KP Times, the student newspaper.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“He was just so genuine,” Ms. Taylor said, choking up. “He loved his wife so much and his son was just such a big part of his life.”</p><p>She paused before adding, “This is just so surreal, like, this just can’t be happening.”</p><h2 id="link-1ed75bdc">Tanya Burwick</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tanya Burwick</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Zac Burwick</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Tanya Burwick, 62, was driving to work in San Angelo on Friday morning when her vehicle was caught in rising floodwaters, according to Ms. Burwick’s son, Zac, who confirmed his mother had died during the floods. Ms. Burwick was found dead on Saturday morning, the San Angelo Police Department said on social media.</p><p>Ms. Burwick worked at Walmart and lived in Blackwell, about 48 miles south of San Angelo.</p><p>“She had a heart of gold,” Mr. Burwick said. “She never knew a stranger and loved everybody that was around her.” Nobody else from the Burwick family was impacted by the floods, he added.</p><h2 id="link-eb0ee55">Chloe Childress</h2><p>Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old counselor at Camp Mystic, died when floodwaters swept through the camp, according to the school she had recently graduated from.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Jonathan Eades, head of school at the Kinkaid School in Houston, wrote in a statement that Chloe lost her life upholding a “selfless and fierce commitment to others.”</p><p>“She was wise beyond her years, with a steady compassion that settled a room,” he wrote. “Whether it was sharing her own challenges to ease someone’s burden or quietly cheering a teammate or classmate through a tough day, Chloe made space for others to feel safe, valued, and brave.”</p><p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Ms. Childress had been working as a counselor at Camp Mystic since June, shortly after graduation.</p><h2 id="link-54b424f9">Dick Eastland</h2><p>The longtime director of Camp Mystic, Dick Eastland, was among the dead, elected officials and family members confirmed.</p><p>Mr. Eastland and his wife, Tweety, have run the nearly-century-old Christian summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe for decades. He was reportedly swept away while trying to rescue children from rising floodwaters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“If he wasn’t going to die of natural causes, this was the only other way, saving the girls that he so loved and cared for,” Mr. Eastland’s grandson George wrote on Instagram. “That’s the man my grandfather was. A husband, father, grandfather, and mentor to thousands of young women, he no longer walks this earth, but his impact will never leave the lives he touched.”</p><h2 id="link-b82366d">Julian Ryan</h2><p>Exhausted from a long night working as a dishwasher at a local restaurant, Julian Ryan, 27, was asleep in his trailer home in Ingram, Texas, when the river reached his front door on Friday before dawn.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Julian Ryan</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christinia Wilson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>By the time he and his fiancée, Christinia Wilson, woke up, water was up to their ankles. His mother, Marilyn Ryan, and his 6-year-old son had already rushed into the room for safety.</p><p>In what seemed like a blink, Ms. Wilson said, the water was up to their waists, their front door had burst open and the river had gushed into the house. Their mattress began to float, so they placed their 13-month-old son and the 6-year-old atop it. The bedroom door was stuck shut from the water pressure on the other side.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In a panic, Mr. Ryan tried to punch through a window so they could escape. But the sharp glass cut nearly through his arm, causing him to bleed profusely, Ms. Wilson and his mother said on Saturday in a phone interview.</p><p>They called 911 again and again, but no one came, both women said. With the water rising to their chins, the women shouted for help as Mr. Ryan started to lose consciousness, they said.</p><p>“He had lost so much blood and knew he wasn’t going to make it,” Ms. Wilson said. “He said, ‘I love you. I’m so sorry.’ In minutes, he was gone.”</p><p>Ms. Wilson said the trailer was torn in half by the force of the water, yet everyone in the family but Mr. Ryan survived.</p><p>“He was the best father, and was always such a happy person who was never above helping people, no matter what it cost,” she said. “He died trying to save us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-7d445a67">Blair and Brooke Harber</h2><p>Two young sisters, Blair and Brooke Harber, were staying in a cabin along the Guadalupe with their grandparents when their cabin was washed away, according to the Rev. Joshua J. Whitfield, the pastor of their Dallas church, St. Rita Catholic Community. Blair, 13, was headed to eighth grade at St. Rita’s school. Brooke, 11, was bound for sixth there.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Blair, left, and Brooke Harber in an undated photo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Jennifer Harber/Facebook</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Both girls died and their grandparents are still missing, the pastor said on Saturday in a letter to parishioners. Their parents — Annie Harber, a first and second grade instructional specialist at St. Rita’s, and RJ Harber — were staying in another cabin and are safe, he said.</p><p>“In moments like this, we are reminded of life’s fragility and the lasting power of faith,” Mr. Whitfield wrote, adding, “We will honor Blair and Brooke’s lives, the light they shared, and the joy they brought to everyone who knew them.”</p><p>A prayer service for the girls was held at the church Saturday afternoon. A photo of the service shows a packed house.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-492ef4be">Katheryn Eads</h2><p>Katheryn Eads, 52, died after being swept away in the floodwaters, her husband Brian Eads said in a brief phone call on Saturday.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Katheryn Eads</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Kerrville Daily Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The couple were awakened by rushing water surrounding them inside their R.V., Mr. Eads said. They managed to get out, and a man driving another R.V. offered them a ride. They made it across the street when the vehicle they were in died, Mr. Eads said. The couple was swept out of the truck by water. Mr. Eads said he was struck in the head by debris and lost track of his wife. He survived by holding onto a tree until he reached dry land, he said.</p><h2 id="link-3316531b">Sarah Marsh</h2><p>Sarah Marsh, an 8-year-old student at Cherokee Bend Elementary in Mountain Brook, Ala., was one of the campers at Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sarah Marsh</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Kerrville Daily Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In a statement posted online, Stewart Welch, the mayor of Mountain Brook, a suburb of Birmingham, confirmed that Sarah was among those who died in the flood and said the city was heartbroken.</p><p>“This is an unimaginable loss for her family, her school and our entire community,” he wrote. “Sarah’s passing is a sorrow shared by all of us, and our hearts are with those who knew her and loved her.”</p><p>In a text message on Saturday, Sarah’s grandmother, Debbie Ford Marsh, said that Sarah’s parents were not able to talk and declined to comment on behalf of the family.</p><p>Earlier, on Facebook, she posted: “We will always feel blessed to have had this beautiful spunky ray of light in our lives. She will live on in our hearts forever!”</p><h2 id="link-2fd35ee4">Janie Hunt</h2><p>Janie Hunt, 9, of Dallas, died in the flash flooding, her grandmother Margaret Hunt said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Janie Hunt</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Kerrville Daily Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Janie was also attending Camp Mystic.

Janie’s parents drove to Ingram Elementary, the reunification center, where they were told to visit a funeral home and identify their daughter. Janie, a great-granddaughter of the oil baron William Herbert Hunt, is the eldest of three children.</p><h2 id="link-23fa423e">Bobby and Amanda Martin</h2><p>Bobby Martin, 46, and his wife, Amanda Martin, 44, were among those killed,</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amanda and Bobby Martin</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Kerrville Daily Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Martin’s father, John Keith Martin, told The New York Times.</p><p>The couple, from Odessa, Texas, were reportedly camping by the Guadalupe River when their R.V. was swept away by the rising floodwaters.
