Political support from other countries was welcome, but their financial aid was not essential to survive.</p><p>Since his rebel coalition toppled President Bashar al-Assad in December, Mr. al-Shara, who spoke to The New York Times this month, has been navigating more complex geopolitical waters. And that foreign support is not just welcome, it is critical to his government’s survival.</p><p>To bring Syria’s economy back from the brink, he must persuade U.S. and other Western officials wary of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html" title="">his jihadist past</a> to lift sanctions. To keep the country from plunging back into civil war, he needs military assistance to build a new army. And to keep the government functioning and the country from spinning into total disarray, he needs foreign financing to pay public workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A joyous crowd lines a road, some standing on cars and waving Syrian flags." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj/00int-syria-shara-01-hbzj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/415d88c1-8d96-5c2d-ae7b-641dee1123b5" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Celebrating the fall of the Assad regime on a road leading to the border with Syria, in Bar Elias, Lebanon, in December.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The case he is presenting to the West, Europe and the wealthy Gulf monarchies is straightforward — Syria’s stability affects the entire Middle East.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Any chaos in Syria will damage not just neighboring countries but the whole world,” Mr. al-Shara said in a wide-ranging interview in the capital, Damascus.</p><p>A former Al Qaeda affiliate who now presents himself as a statesmen, Mr. al-Shara said his government is negotiating deals with both Turkey, a longtime political backer, and Russia, a stalwart supporter of Mr. al-Assad when he was in power.

And any new agreements have to ensure “Syria’s independence, the stability of its security, and that no country’s presence creates a threat or danger to other nations via Syrian territory,” Mr. al-Shara added.</p><p>During the civil war, Russia sent aircrafts, warships, troops and military advisers to Syria to prop up Mr. al-Assad and killed thousands of civilians.</p><p>It remains unclear what role, if any, Russia will play in postwar Syria. But Mr. al-Shara said Moscow had supplied the Syrian military for decades, implying that his country may need Russia or other nations’ support again in the future.</p><p>“Until now, we have not had offers from other nations to replace Syrian arms” which are primarily Russian produced, he said.</p><p>Mr. al-Assad fled to Russia in early December as his regime collapsed and in January, Syrian officials asked the Kremlin to hand him over as a condition for maintaining a military presence in Syria.

Mr. al-Shara is also still under U.N. sanctions as is the rebel group he led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In recent weeks, Europe has eased sanctions and the United States has issued a temporary carve out to allow humanitarian aid into Syria. But that relief has had little effect on the economy so far.</p><p>Before his rebels seized power, “the economy was systematically being destroyed,” Mr. al-Shara said. “Entire sectors were nearly destroyed: Agricultural, economical, the financial sector, the service industries, tourism.”</p><p>This month, Mr. al-Shara visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar looking for financial support. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatar-plans-help-boost-syrian-government-salaries-sources-say-2025-01-07/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Qatar has offered to pay</a> public sector salaries through Syria’s central bank, but is concerned that doing so would violate U.S. sanctions.</p><p>Last month, American officials listed eight demands for lifting sanctions, according to two officials with knowledge of the issue. They include destroying any remaining <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-weapons-assad.html" title="">chemical weapons stores</a> and cooperating on counterterrorism efforts.</p><p>American and European officials have also pushed for the removal of foreign fighters who served in Mr. al-Shara’s rebel coalition and, in some cases, have been appointed to roles in his government, making this another condition of sanctions relief.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The destroyed Jobar neighborhood of Damascus, Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>That demand in particular puts Mr. al-Shara in a bind: On the one hand, he must cooperate with Western countries if he wants to win their support. On the other hand, he needs to appease the more extremist factions within his former rebel coalition that helped him topple Mr. al-Assad and bring them under the government’s fold. Otherwise, they could threaten the country’s fragile peace.</p><p>Mr. al-Shara said that some American conditions “need to be discussed or modified” and declined to elaborate further.</p><p>He also suggested his government would consider giving Syrian citizenship to foreign fighters who have lived in the country for years, are in some cases married to Syrian citizens and “who have stuck beside the revolution.” That could complicate his bid for sanctions relief and stoke fears among Western countries about Syria becoming a haven for extremists, experts say.</p><p>Mr. al-Shara has sought to assuage those concerns, pledging to prevent Syrian land from being used to threaten any foreign country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“Syria has been committed from the beginning, before we reached Damascus, to preventing its land from being used in any way that can threaten any foreign country,” he said.</p><p>So far, his government has struggled to maintain security and exert its authority over the more extremist former rebel factions.</p><p>In March, Assad loyalists launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/middleeast/syria-clashes-assad.html" title="">a coordinated attack</a> on the new government’s troops in a coastal region that was once the heartland of Mr. al-Assad’s base. In response, thousands of armed fighters — including many among the more extremist factions — flooded into the region and killed an estimated 1,600 civilians within days, according to a war monitoring group.</p><p>The sectarian-driven killings targeted the Alawite religious minority, which the Assad family belongs to. They exposed how little control Mr. al-Shara has over former rebel forces that served in his coalition and the weakness of the new national army he is trying to build, which struggled to quell the violence for days.</p><p>Mr. al-Shara said his government is committed to maintaining peace on the coast and will hold those responsible for the violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>The building up of a unified military is one of the chief challenges Mr. al-Shara faces as he tries to secure government control across the country.
