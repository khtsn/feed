For just $1 million, you can join Freedom 250, a public- private partnership that offers special access to the president. It’s that private sector part that’s unique here. That cash gets you a private reception and a historic photo opportunity. Drop 2.5 million and they’ll even let you speak onstage in D.C. on the Fourth of July. This party is more than just fireworks. The plan includes building a triumphal arch near the Lincoln Memorial, a U.F.C. fight on the White House lawn —— “It is definitely going to happen.” And an Indy car race around the National Mall. This is about rebranding America in Trump’s image. But while the president sells tickets to his birthday party, the princelings of his administration are busy selling something else. “Come on, buddy, let’s go. Let’s have some fun with this.” Trump’s sons and the son of a cabinet member have made at least $1.2 billion in cash from their new crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. They even sold a secret $500 million stake in the company to a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family. “President Trump’s own son signed the deal for half a billion dollars.” As we approach the semiquincentennial, the message is clear. The golden age of America is here. As long as you have the cash to buy your way in.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><header><div><div><div><nyt-betamax><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template><nyt-betamax-cover><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template><nyt-betamax-poster><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-jumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75" data-testid="betamax-poster" sizes="(width &lt; 740px) 95vw, 500px" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-master180.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 180w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-blog225.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 225w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-popup.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 282w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-slide.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 282w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-master315.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 315w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-tmagSF.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 362w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-blog427.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 427w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-blog480.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 480w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-master495.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 495w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-blog533.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 533w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-jumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 576w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-tmagArticle.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 592w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-articleLarge.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-master675.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 675w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-master768.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 768w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-master1050.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 1050w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/13/arts/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb/DMT-BIRTHDAY-PARTY_clean-thumb-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 1080w" fetchpriority="high"/></template></nyt-betamax-poster></nyt-betamax-cover><nyt-betamax-overlay-controls><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template></nyt-betamax-overlay-controls><nyt-betamax-ads><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template></nyt-betamax-ads></nyt-betamax></div><div><p><span>As the United States prepares to turn 250, the Trump administration is turning the celebration into a pay-to-play spectacle where even a speaking role on the National Mall is up for sale.</span></p><p>By Kathleen Kingsbury</p><p>February 14, 2026</p></div></div></div></header></div></div></div></div>
