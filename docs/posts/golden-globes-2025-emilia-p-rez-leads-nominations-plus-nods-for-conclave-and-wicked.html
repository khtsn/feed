On Monday, the companies behind the Globes announced the 2025 list of nominees, and — ka-ching! — there are a ton of stars on it, including Angelina Jolie, Timothée Chalamet, Zoe Saldaña, Nicole Kidman, Jamie Foxx, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ariana Grande, Keira Knightley, Pamela Anderson, Zendaya, Demi Moore, Glen Powell, Selena Gomez, Daniel Craig, Kate Winslet, Miley Cyrus and Denzel Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Netflix’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/movies/emilia-perez-review.html" title="">“Emilia Pérez,”</a> a Spanish-language musical exploring trans identity, received 10 nominations, the most of any movie, including one for best comedy or musical. “The Brutalist,” “Conclave,” “Wicked” and “Anora” will be among the other films contending for the top prizes, with “The Bear,” “Shogun,” “Only Murders in the Building” and “Baby Reindeer” among the programs vying for the TV equivalents.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Notable nominations included Winslet, a surprise double nominee for “Lee,” a little-seen biopic with mediocre reviews, and “The Regime,” a poorly reviewed HBO mini-series. The best director category included Coralie Fargeat for her satirical body horror film “The Substance” and Payal Kapadia for “All We Imagine Is Light,” about a Mumbai nurse; both women will now figure more prominently in the Oscar conversation.</p><p>And the notable omissions? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/movies/danielle-deadwyler-the-piano-lesson.html" title="">Danielle Deadwyler</a> (“The Piano Lesson”) and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/movies/marianne-jean-baptiste-mike-leigh-oscars.html" title="">Marianne Jean-Baptiste</a> (“Hard Truths”), both perceived as potential Oscar nominees, were among several Black performers who did not make the list. Similarly, the prison drama “Sing Sing” was largely passed over, although its star, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/movies/colman-domingo-the-color-purple-rustin.html" title="">Colman Domingo</a>, received a nod.</p><p>Some nominees are Globes warhorses. Kidman, nominated for best actress in a drama for her performance in “Babygirl,” an erotic thriller, has now racked up 19 career nominations. (She’s a six-time winner.) Washington, recognized for “Gladiator II,” now has 11 career nominations. (He has won twice.)</p><p>First-time nominees included Adam Brody, for the “hot rabbi” Netflix series “Nobody Wants This,” and Kathryn Hahn, singled out for her performance in the Disney+ series “Agatha All Along.”</p><p>The comedian Nikki Glaser will host the 2025 Globes, which CBS and Paramount+ will broadcast live on Jan. 5.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/movies/the-golden-globes-lawsuit-hollywood-foreign-press.html" title="">Hollywood Foreign Press Association</a> invented the Globes in the 1940s to gain access to movie stars. In 2023, after a series of ethics, finance and diversity scandals, the nonprofit organization sold its assets to Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which is part of Penske Media. The companies then recruited entertainment journalists from 85 countries to form a mostly new 334-person voting body. (The H.F.P.A. no longer exists. It had about 80 voters.)</p><p>But the more the Globes have tried to change, the more they have seemed to stay the same.</p><p>The 2024 Globes telecast was widely criticized as a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/golden-globes-2024-show-review-awards-insider?srsltid=AfmBOoqEtP6XCfoX1gk66bz466oj1U_vF8kO07KL_hoKtvBRhf9FUkxi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chaotic fiasco</a>. Jo Koy was hired to host at the last minute after bigger names publicly passed on the gig. He bombed. “The evening was otherwise dominated by rushed, perfunctory speeches by honorees who hardly seemed happy to be there,” Alison Herman <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/tv-reviews/golden-globes-2024-review-1235864448/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in Variety</a>, the Hollywood trade publication.</p><p>The Globes have been in turmoil since 2021, when The Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members#:~:text=After%20a%20year%20defined%20by,Assn.%20has%20drawn%20widespread%20attention." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discovered</a> that the voting pool had no Black members. More than 100 publicists closed ranks, refusing to make stars available for Golden Globe appearances and leading to NBC’s cancellation of the 2022 telecast. Citing subsequent Globes reforms, NBC brought back the show in 2023 before walking away completely, ending a three-decade partnership.</p><p>CBS rescued the 2024 Globes, although it paid less than $10 million for the rights; NBC had been paying $60 million annually. The show attracted roughly 9.5 million viewers, a sharp increase from the prior year, according to Nielsen. Encouraged, CBS agreed to televise the Globes for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/business/media/cbs-5-year-deal-golden-globes.html" title="">five more years</a>.</p><p>As with the Oscars, Globes viewership tends to fluctuate based on the popularity of nominated movies. The most-recent Globes rode “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” to Nielsen ratings success. (Together, they collected more than $2 billion at the worldwide box office.) “Wicked,” nominated for four prizes on Monday, will help this time around; it has taken $456 million over its first three weeks in theaters. “Dune: Part Two,” nominated for two Globes, took in $714 million in the spring.</p><p>Aside from “Wicked” and “Dune: Part Two,” few of the movies nominated for best drama or comedy-musical have connected with audiences. “Anora,” about a romance between a sex worker and a Russian scion, has collected $13 million in four months of release in the United States. “Emilia Pérez” officially has ticket sales of zero, and the response on Netflix has been muted.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Brooks Barnes covers all things Hollywood.
