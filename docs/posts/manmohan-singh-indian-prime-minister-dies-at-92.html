Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced the death on <a href="https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1872328464658808947" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">X</a>, in which he called Mr. Singh one of India’s “most distinguished leaders.”</p><p>With his trademark powder-blue turban, Mr. Singh was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/world/india-swears-in-13th-prime-minister-and-first-sikh-in-job.html" title="">first Indian prime minister from the country’s small Sikh minority</a>, which is concentrated in the northern state of Punjab.</p><p>Born in what is now Pakistan, he belonged to a generation whose early lives were molded by the mass migrations that followed partition as India won independence in 1947 — the precursor to many tortured decades of ethnic, religious and regional conflicts, punctuated by the assassinations of political leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Such was his fabled reticence that he gave only a handful of news conferences, even as the economy slowed and his government became mired in accusations of scandals related to the allocation of cellphone licenses and coal fields.</p><p>Mr. Singh came to public prominence in 1991 when, as finance minister and a former governor of India’s central bank, <a href="https://yourstory.com/2016/09/manmohan-singh-economic-reforms/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he oversaw changes</a> that set his vast, turbulent nation of more than 1.1 billion people on a path toward becoming a regional economic dynamo. The changes fueled a huge expansion in white-collar prosperity in a country that nonetheless continued to struggle with extreme poverty.</p><p>As a prime minister of coalition governments from 2004 to 2014, he held office in the world’s most populous democracy with the crucial support of the political party<span>  </span>created by Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, the founders of modern India.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Singh, center, as India’s finance minister in 1995, with other officials in his department.

Gandhi, headed the powerful Indian Congress Party, which won a surprise victory in the 2004 elections over the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Defying expectations that she would assume a top office, Ms. Gandhi declined the role of prime minister, citing fears that her non-Indian roots would provoke opposition. But she maintained her position as head of the Congress Party while Mr. Singh became prime minister, drawing criticism that he was little more than a placeholder for her son, Rahul Gandhi.</p><p>Sonia Gandhi cast the appointment in a different light.</p><p>“Manmohan Singh became prime minister at a time when the country was on the edge, when its collective nerves were frayed and when its secular fabric was under assault,” she said in late 2018. “Within months, his persona and policies had a profound calming effect. The country once again had the assurance that the man at the very top was not a divisive person, that no group or individual need feel insecure.”</p><p>Once in office, Mr. Singh pressed forward with attempts at reconciliation with Pakistan, which, like India, was a nuclear-armed regional player with ambitions for more influence and a visceral suspicion of its neighbor. Those efforts came under severe strain when terrorists from a Pakistan-based jihadist movement, Lashkar-e-Taiba, launched a three-day assault on targets in Mumbai in<span>  </span>2008 that killed 171 people.</p><p>The onslaught was the bloodiest and most sustained in a string of attacks that had begun six months earlier in Indian cities, and it exposed Mr. Singh to charges that his administration had been ineffective against terrorism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pakistani terrorists attacked the Taj Mahal Palace hotel and other targets in Mumbai, India, in November 2008.

But during that period, he grew remote.</p><p>“Great leaders, even moderately good ones, are willed to action in times of crisis,” Vaibhav Vats, an author and journalist based in New Delhi, <a href="https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/the-man-who-forgot-he-was-prime-minister" title="">wrote in The New York Times</a> in early 2014. “Mr. Singh retreated into a perplexing and imperturbable silence.”</p><p>In 2014 he announced that he would not run for a third term. “History will judge me more kindly than the contemporary media,” he said at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Manmohan Singh was born on Sept. 26, 1932, in the village of Gah, which is now in Pakistan. His mother, Amrit Kaur, died when he was a child, and he was raised by the family of his father, Gurmuk Singh.</p><p>Mr. Singh married Gursharan Kaur in 1958. They had three daughters, Upinder Singh, Daman Singh and Amrit Singh. His wife and daughters survive him.</p><p>He studied at Hindu College and Panjab University in Chandigarh, India, and went on to St. John’s College at Cambridge<span>  </span>in 1957. In 1960 he started a doctoral thesis at Nuffield College, Oxford, that explored India’s export performance in the 1950s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Singh meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House in 2013.

He began his career in public policy in 1972 as chief economic adviser in the Finance Ministry. He became governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central bank, in 1982.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In June 1991 — to his surprise, he said — he was appointed finance minister by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, who took office after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi as India seemed on the verge of economic collapse.</p><p>Mr. Singh’s appointment was regarded as an unconventional choice. His policies broke from the mold in a country with a centralized economy, permitting a degree of deregulation and opening India up to foreign investment. One government minister once called him the Deng Xiaoping of India, referring to the Chinese leader who unleashed his country’s economic might.</p><p>Mr. Singh was prime minister when India became a founding member in 2009 of the so-called BRICS group: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, which joined in 2010. The founding of the group was widely seen as a display of emergent economic muscle.</p><p>Mr. Singh was never elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, but he had been a member of the upper Rayja Sabha since 1991. His arrival as a technocrat prime minister in 2004 was seen by many Indians as a break with entrenched corruption among the political and business classes. By 2007, India had one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, at 9 percent a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Singh in 2019 at a memorial for Mohandas Gandhi. After leaving office in 2014, he went back to teaching but continued to speak out about what he said were the authoritarian tendencies of Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist government.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Harish Tyagi/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>During Mr. Singh’s tenure, India signed <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-india-nuclear-deal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a deal</a> with Washington that ended a moratorium on nuclear trade; improved its relations with Israel and China, its rival as Asia’s leading powerhouse; and supported the government of Afghanistan with financial aid, enhancing India’s regional standing.</p><p>When he first came to office, in 2004, Mr. Singh seemed bent on resolving the festering dispute over Kashmir, which had been divided at independence into areas controlled by predominantly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. At the time, a deal seemed possible with Pakistan, which was led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, a Muslim born in New Delhi who, like Mr. Singh, was a child of partition. But the divisions never healed.</p><p>In May 2009, the Indian National Congress, led by Ms. Gandhi, pulled off another surprise in national elections, scoring its best result in 25 years and putting itself in position to shed its troublesome coalition partners, notably India’s Communist parties. The victory was ascribed by Mr. Singh’s critics in large part to Ms. Gandhi’s dominant role in the political maneuverings that underpinned his premiership.</p><p>Where he had once been depicted by supporters as erudite and decisive, he was now ridiculed by his critics as weak and ineffective. India’s growth had eased, rural poverty persisted and the country faced newer challenges, such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/29/world/asia/condition-worsens-for-victim-of-gang-rape-in-india.html" title="">the riots and protests</a> that followed the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in 2012.</p><p>Mr. Singh announced his resignation before the 2014 elections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Singh with Sonia Gandhi in 2013.

He continued to sound warnings about where India was headed under its new Hindu nationalist government.</p><p>In April 2018, he declared in a lecture at Panjab: “We need to ask ourselves whether we are losing patience with democracy and turning to more authoritarian alternatives that may well yield superior short-term results, but in the long term, will end up destroying our country and all the achievements of the last seventy years.”</p><p>Ash Wu<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>After a long career as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times based in Africa, the Middle East and Europe, Alan Cowell became a freelance contributor in 2015, based in London.
