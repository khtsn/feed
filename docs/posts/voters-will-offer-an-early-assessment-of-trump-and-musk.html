    <h1>Voters Will Offer an Early Assessment of Trump and Musk</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In Wisconsin and Florida, voters went to the polls today for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/wisconsin-florida-elections-musk-trump.html" title="">elections that will offer the best evidence yet</a> of whether President Trump maintains robust support.</p><p>In Florida, two Republicans are expected to win special elections for deep-red House seats. But Democrats have been able to feed on their voters’ fury to make at least one of the races closer than expected. We’re <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/elections/florida-house-special-election-turnout.html" title="">tracking each party’s turnout</a> in the state, and you can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/01/us/elections/results-florida-special.html" title="">see the results here</a> as they come in.</p><p>In Wisconsin, Republicans wanted today’s State Supreme Court election to be all about Trump, our politics reporter Reid Epstein told me. The president won the state in November and the conservative candidate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/brad-schimel-trump-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">Brad Schimel</a>, has been doing everything he can to associate with Trump, including wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat.</p><p>“He is doing everything short of standing up and yelling: Trump, Trump, Trump,” said Reid, who reported today from Madison, the state’s capital.<span>  </span>“On the other hand, Democrats are standing up yelling: Musk, Musk, Musk.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That’s because, as Reid described to me, Elon Musk has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/elon-musk-wisconsin.html" title=""><em>the</em></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/elon-musk-wisconsin.html" title=""> central player</a> in the Wisconsin contest. Musk and groups tied to him have poured more than $25 million into what is the most expensive judicial election in American history.</p><p>Polling suggests Musk has less residual popularity among Republicans than Trump, and Democrats have urged voters to support the liberal candidate, Susan Crawford, as a way to push back against the billionaire and his effort to dismantle the federal bureaucracy. Turnout in the race <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/elections/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-turnout.html" title="">is expected to be strong</a>. We will update <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/01/us/elections/results-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">this page when we get results</a>.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>Democrats are likely to be buoyed by their results today and in many elections over the next few years, our chief political analyst Nate Cohn explained. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/upshot/special-elections-democrats-voting.html" title="">But that doesn’t mean that their problems are solved</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-349921b3">Cory Booker slams Trump for 23 hours and counting</h2><p>Last night, Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator, went to a lectern on the Senate floor and started delivering a speech filled with sharp criticisms of Trump. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/booker-senate-trump.html" title="">Nearly 24 hours later, Booker is still speaking</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He is not blocking any nominees or legislation.
