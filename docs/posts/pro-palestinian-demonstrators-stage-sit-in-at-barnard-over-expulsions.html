A Police Department spokesman said that a 41-year-old man had been taken by ambulance to Mt. Sinai Morningside Hospital at 4:08 p.m. complaining of “pain about the body” and was in stable condition.</p><p>The sit-in ended Wednesday night after Barnard set a deadline and threatened to take further action, such as calling in the New York Police Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Tonight, a small group of masked protesters attempted to undermine Barnard’s core values of respect, inclusion, and academic excellence,” the Barnard president, Laura Rosenbury, said in a statement. She noted that the protesters had left and added, “But let us be clear: Their disregard for the safety of our community remains completely unacceptable.”</p><p>Chanting “there is only one solution, intifada revolution” and beating drums, the students began their sit-in. Their demands included the immediate reversal of the student suspensions and amnesty for all other students disciplined for pro-Palestinian activism. They also requested a public meeting with Dean Grinage, who they <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGjPLI_pQBW/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> could decide on appeals of the student suspensions, and with President Rosenbury.</p><p>“Disruption until Divestment, Resistance Until Return, Agitation until Amnesty,” Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, a banned group on campus, posted on X with images of the sit-in. “We will not stop until our demands are met.”</p><p>After several hours, a faculty intermediary, <a href="https://x.com/unityoffields" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kristina Milnor,</a> the chair of the Barnard classics department, told the students that Dean Grinage had offered to meet with up to three protesters, but only if they came in unmasked and showed identification, according to video posted by the protesters.</p><p>The students rejected the terms. President Rosenbury was in Florida, Professor Milnor told the students.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>About 8:30 p.m., Robin Levine, a Barnard spokeswoman, issued a statement saying that if the students did not agree to leave the building by 9:30 p.m., “Barnard will be forced to consider additional, necessary measures to protect our campus.”</p><p>She said that the college did not know if all of the protesters were Barnard students, and that there had been violence entering the hall.</p><p>“We have made multiple good-faith efforts to de-escalate. Barnard leadership offered to meet with the protesters — just as we meet with all members of our community — on one simple condition: remove their masks. They refused. We have also offered mediation,” Ms. Levine said in the statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators passed up food and supplies through an open window of Milbank Hall.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">C.S.

Several students were seen escaping out a first-floor window as the deadline came and went.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At 10:40 p.m., the protesters, chanting and beating a drum, marched out peacefully. At least nine Police Department vans were parked on Riverside Drive near the campus about 10 p.m.</p><p>The students were protesting the expulsion of two students who had been accused of participating in a disruption of Professor Avi Shilon’s “History of Modern Israel” class at Columbia University on Jan. 21.</p><p>Professor Shilon, a visiting history professor from Israel, had been reviewing the syllabus with students when four masked pro-Palestinian demonstrators entered the classroom. The protesters <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGbAlcjpCyF/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filmed themselves</a>, saying they were disrupting a “Zionist class” from “intellectualizing and normalizing a genocide.” They handed out antisemitic fliers, including one of a Jewish star being stomped by a jackboot.</p><p>Professor Shilon, after recovering from his initial shock, asked the protesters if they wanted to stay to study instead of disrupting the class, he said in an interview. They refused. After about five minutes, they left.</p><p>The expulsions of the two students were disclosed by the student protest group Columbia University Apartheid Divest. Barnard officials declined to discuss the status of the students, who have not been identified, citing confidentiality concerns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Expulsion is a rare punishment, and the speed and severity of Barnard’s discipline surprised many students. A third protester from the classroom disruption is a Columbia student who <a href="https://communications.news.columbia.edu/news/statement-post-unsanctioned-group-classroom-disruption" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been suspended</a> while an investigation continues; a fourth has not been identified.</p><p>President Rosenbury, in a statement on Sunday, said that student privacy rules prevented her from commenting directly on the expulsions. “That said, as a matter of principle and policy,” she wrote, “Barnard will always take decisive action to protect our community as a place where learning thrives, individuals feel safe and higher education is celebrated.”</p><p>She indicated that the students had not displayed remorse and had shown “no reflection, and no willingness to change.” Indeed, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, which <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGbAlcjpCyF/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> video of the disruption, celebrated it, writing, “STUDENTS DISRUPTED A ZIONIST CLASS, YOU SHOULD TOO!”</p><p>Eryn Davis<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-otterman">More about Sharon Otterman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
