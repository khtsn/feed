It was the deadliest attack on the city in nearly a year.</p><p>President Trump, who just hours earlier had suggested that Ukraine’s president was the central impediment to peace, issued a rare public rebuke of Vladimir Putin: “Vladimir, STOP!” Trump wrote on his social media platform. “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing.”</p><p>During an Oval Office meeting this afternoon, the president promised that he was putting a lot of pressure on Russia behind the scenes and said the country had made a “pretty big concession.” Pressed on what the concession was, Trump replied, “Stopping taking the whole country.”</p><p>Trump also made clear that the strikes did not change his view on the war. Unlike the Biden administration — which was proudly Ukraine’s chief benefactor — Trump said he had “no allegiance” to either side and that his only goal was to stop the fighting and save lives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>European officials said they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/europe/europe-ukraine-russia-trump.html" title="">agreed with the Ukrainians</a> that the proposed American peace plan was too favorable to Russia. And a core group of European countries have said they are prepared to keep supporting Ukraine should the Americans walk away.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">KC McGinnis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5d75c69e">A judge curtailed Trump’s ability to punish schools over D.E.I.</h2><p>A federal judge in New Hampshire limited the Trump administration’s ability to withhold <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/trump-public-school-funds-dei.html" title="">federal funds from public schools that have diversity and equity initiatives</a>. The judge, Landya McCafferty, an Obama appointee, said that the administration’s policy threatened to restrict free speech in the classroom and overstepped the executive branch’s legal authority.</p><p>The government is expected to appeal. While the administration has not offered a detailed definition of what it calls “illegal D.E.I. practices,” officials have suggested that targeted academic support to specific groups of students, such as Black boys, amount to segregation, and that lessons on concepts such as white privilege or structural racism are discriminatory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Security personnel outside the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manish Swarup/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-de44fbe">Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated</h2><p>Soon after militants killed 26 tourists this week in the picturesque Himalayan region of Kashmir, India pointed a finger at its archnemesis, Pakistan.

If India does follow through on its threat to block the flow of the Indus River system, Pakistan said it would consider that to be “an act of war.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Christine Walsh, whose husband, Mark Walsh, died after a bout of flu and strep that led to sepsis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Luong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-5e697265">One Man’s Story</h2><p>Nascimento Blair spent 21 years in the U.S. — as a prisoner, a college student and a businessman — until he was deported to Jamaica. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/nyregion/deportation-trump-jamaica.html" title="">The Times followed his journey.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kirby Lee/Imagn Images, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-19dab9da">It’s draft day</h2><p>Some football fans look forward to the N.F.L.

And groups of all kinds, from hip-hop to salsa, have found that the space has a lot going for it: It’s easily accessible, the floors are spacious and smooth, there’s a built-in audience and the windows double as mirrors. Best of all, it’s free.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>Have a joyous evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
