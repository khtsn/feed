    <h1>Hannah Berner Finds Her Latest Act in Standup Comedy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>It’s easy to fall into a parasocial relationship with Hannah Berner — open Netflix and she’s talking about shower sex; open your podcast app, and she’s explaining that “fart walks” aid digestion; scroll through TikTok, and she’s asking people on the street if they urinate in hot tubs.</p><p>Over the last few years, Ms. Berner has made herself ubiquitous in the internet ecosystem, disarming viewers with her unfiltered humor and confessions.</p><p>Like many celebrities of our time, Ms. Berner, 33, has an eclectic résumé. She ascended to minor fame in 2019, when she was on the Bravo reality show “Summer House” for three seasons. After exiting in 2021 following an unexpected villain arc, Ms. Berner pivoted to focusing on her standup, becoming known as a “girls’ girl” comedian who jokes about involuntary bodily functions in one breath, and guns the next (“If I had a gun, I would lose it in my room every five minutes. <em>Can someone call my gun?</em>”).</p><p>As of late, that C.V. includes a summer Netflix comedy special, “We Ride at Dawn”; a cross-country tour for <a href="https://gigglysquad.com/pages/live-shows" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the live version</a> of her popular podcast, “Giggly Squad,” with fellow host Paige DeSorbo, concluding at Radio City Music Hall in January; and a forthcoming book by the two, <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Giggle/Hannah-Berner/9781668056004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“How to Giggle: A Guide to Taking Life Less Seriously.”</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/14/multimedia/14HANNAH-BERNER-02-mgbc/14HANNAH-BERNER-02-mgbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/14/multimedia/14HANNAH-BERNER-02-mgbc/14HANNAH-BERNER-02-mgbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/14/multimedia/14HANNAH-BERNER-02-mgbc/14HANNAH-BERNER-02-mgbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A still from Ms. Berner’s comedy special shows her in a strapless gold jumpsuit, holding a microphone with a cord.

Ms. Berner spent her childhood, adolescence and college years training to become a professional tennis player.</p><p>Raised in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Ms. Berner had her first viral moment in 2009, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/nyregion/01tennis.html" title="">The New York Times</a> and other <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2009/06/01/amid-controversy-hannah-berner-beacon-top-cardozo-for-mayors-cup/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/the-tennis-ball-is-in-her-court/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1725938812829124&amp;usg=AOvVaw0CDB_wO7ED5veibWwX0VVP" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">newspapers</a> reported that she was competing for the boys’ tennis team at Beacon High School in Manhattan, which didn’t have a girls’ team at the time. Not everyone was happy.</p><p>“I think that was when I first realized that my purpose on this planet was disrupting male spaces,” Ms. Berner said over pancakes at Grand Canyon Diner, a neighborhood spot she frequented while growing up in a brownstone a few blocks away.</p><p>“I remember men getting mad and I didn’t feel like I should make myself smaller, but that I should make myself bigger,” she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>She ranked nationally as a teenager and was named most valuable player on her team at the University of Wisconsin, but quit tennis after graduation.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The New York Times wrote about Ms. Berner when she was competing for the boys’ tennis team in high school. “I think that was when I first realized that my purpose on this planet was disrupting male spaces.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Estrin/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I got hit by a car and the first thing I said was, ‘Tell my coach I’ll be late for practice,’” she said. </p><p>“I need to listen to the universe right now,” she recalled thinking. “I love the sport, but I wasn’t happy, and I had been unhappy for so long, I didn’t even know it. It was like a drug. If I won, I felt nothing, and if I lost, I was depressed.”</p><h2 id="link-30bb9062">A Second Act</h2><p>Bereft, she soul-searched for a few years after college until she started freelancing for Betches, a digital media company in 2017, writing, producing and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK3J79uY60&amp;ab_channel=Betches" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sometimes starring in</a> videos for the site a few days a week.</p><p>It didn’t pay much, but she was living with her parents at the time, and she discovered she had a knack for dreaming up funny content that spoke to the people — or really, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/10/style/girls-internet-gender.html" title="">girlies</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As her videos for Betches began to take off, she started a podcast called “Berning in Hell,” in which she interviewed people in entertainment about their “personal hells,” and started writing punchy tweets that she would send to meme-sharing social media accounts. </p><p>In the summer of 2018, she joined the third season of “Summer House,” a Bravo show that follows a group of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/style/summer-house-west-wilson.html" title="">young New Yorkers</a> summering in the Hamptons. She already knew a few of the cast members when a producer reached out over Instagram. Ms. Berner had always liked the attention that came with being on camera, she said, and she enjoyed her first two seasons.</p><p>Shortly after her first season of “Summer House” aired, a friend dared her to take all those jokes and perform 10 minutes of standup in front of a few hundred people at Carolines on Broadway. Ms. Berner was surprised by how calm she felt onstage.</p><p>“After the intensity of tennis and the competitiveness, standup feels like being at after-school arts and crafts,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>These days, she feels most comfortable onstage. “After the intensity of tennis and the competitiveness, standup feels like being at after-school arts and crafts,” Ms. Berner said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Krista Schlueter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>She began touring the country, finessing her act, finding that her audiences were mostly women. “They just let me be myself,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Her star was rising — until Season 5 of “Summer House,” which was shot during the first summer of the coronavirus pandemic. “We were locked in the house for eight weeks,” she said. “I was having nightmares, I wasn’t eating. It was just horrible.”</p><p>Still, it wasn’t until the show aired in February 2021 that Ms. Berner realized how she had come across on television.</p><p>“It was like seeing a story told by someone who doesn’t like you,” she said. “I had just gotten engaged. I remember being like, Why would this guy want to be with me?”</p><p>She had gone from being a well-liked character to a target of hate; fans railed at her for fighting with her roommates, throwing tantrums and not taking enough responsibility for her actions. A couple of months later, she was fired from the show. (Bravo did not return requests for comment; Ms. Berner said she would not return to reality television, nor does she watch it anymore.)</p><p>Along with standup, Ms. Berner credited her boyfriend at the time, Des Bishop, now her husband, for getting her through the aftermath.</p><p>“He kept me off my phone and kept my head up,” she said.</p><p>They had met in July 2020, when she was hunkering down with her parents and their four cats on Shelter Island in New York. Mr. Bishop, who’s also a comedian and was staying in Westhampton, an hour away, DMed her to ask if she wanted to grab a coffee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>She liked him immediately.</p><p>While she was filming “Summer House,” they talked on the phone every night. About six months after their first meeting, they got engaged. They married in 2022 and now live together on the Lower East Side, close to the comedy clubs they both frequent.</p><p>“We got engaged before either of us ever saw the other do standup,” Ms. Berner said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Berner and her husband, Des Bishop, also a comedian, met in July 2020. “We laughed for four hours,” she said.

Mr. Bishop is 48. “He speaks Mandarin, he’s traveled all over the world, he’s smart, he reminds me of my family. I just fell in love.”</p><h2 id="link-d4bf4aa">Circumventing the Traditional Path</h2><p>Ms. Berner is one of a recent wave of women who have made names for themselves in comedy and entertainment by building audiences through podcasts and social media.</p><p>The group includes the podcasters Claire Parker and Ashley Hamilton of “<a href="https://www.celebritymemoirbookclub.biz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Celebrity Memoir Book Club</a>” and Chelsea Devantez of “<a href="https://www.chelsearosedevantez.com/the-podcast" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Glamorous Trash</a>”; the actors <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@delaneysayshello?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Delaney Rowe</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/18/t-magazine/music-art-fashion-beginnings.html" title="">Megan Stalter</a>; the YouTube star <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/style/chicken-shop-date-amelia-dimoldenberg.html" title="">Amelia Dimoldenberg</a>; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/style/alex-cooper-call-her-daddy-podcast.html" title="">Alex Cooper</a> of “Call Her Daddy” (Ms. Cooper, who is a fan, described Ms. Berner’s focus on women and ability to command an audience in an email as “inspiring”). Ms. Berner occupies a space that’s somewhere between these women and bawdy comedy stars like Chelsea Handler and Ali Wong.</p><p>Whitney Cummings, a longtime comedian and actress, said that the comedy landscape had changed in recent years, and that being mean for the sake of a joke is out. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Ms. Berner, she said, “is a breath of fresh air because she can be funny without the darkness and without hurting anybody.”</p><p>In the past, she said, “for a woman to even be tolerated in comedy, you had to hate yourself.”</p><p>But though Ms. Berner pokes fun at herself, she also publicly celebrates her marriage, her career and her friendships. “You don’t feel like you’re enjoying her at the expense of her mental health,” Ms. Cummings said.</p><p>After Ms. Berner was fired from “Summer House,” she invested heavily — both time and money — in touring with her standup routine and in her podcast “<a href="https://gigglysquad.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Giggly Squad</a>,” on which she and Ms. DeSorbo, her roommate-turned-bestie since their first season of “Summer House,” chat about anything and everything. A recent episode covered the 20-photo slide show format on Instagram; accidentally choking on food during work meetings; and Ms. Berner’s Uber Eats order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paige DeSorbo, left, and Ms. Berner became close their first season together on “Summer House.” Now they co-host a hit podcast, “Giggly Squad,” for which are embarking on a 35-city tour.  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bravo, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“Not only did she bounce back, she bounced back 10 times harder than anyone on our show, and anyone I know,” Ms. DeSorbo said.</p><h2 id="link-c37bd46">On the Road, Again and Again</h2><p>Her life these days is hectic — three days after we met in Park Slope, she was in Calgary, Alberta, to perform at a comedy festival, and then it’s on to her 35-city tour with Ms. DeSorbo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The discipline Ms. Berner learned playing competitive tennis from ages 8 to 22 has helped keep her steady, she said. She doesn’t drink alcohol on the road (she prefers Gatorade Zero) and heads straight to bed after her shows end.</p><p>Ms. Berner said she wanted to make sure that her passion for comedy didn’t end up bringing her misery, the way tennis did.</p><p>“I was very mean to myself, but I learned the voices in your head aren’t always you,” she said. “They could be bullies or coaches. You don’t have to believe every thought you think.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Berner has learned to overcome the inner critic she felt as a competitive tennis player. “I was very mean to myself, but I learned the voices in your head aren’t always you,” she said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Krista Schlueter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Her biggest psychological test so far came in March 2024, two weeks before taping the Netflix special.</p><p>“It was literally my demons being like, ‘We’re still here. You’re still the same little girl,’” she said. “And I remember a quote that said, ‘What if you just let your dreams come true?’ Right before I went onstage, this calm came over me. You’re not that little girl anymore. You’re prepared, you wrote this and you can do this.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
