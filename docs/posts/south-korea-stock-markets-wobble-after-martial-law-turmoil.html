Shares of some of South Korea’s biggest companies were down, with Samsung Electronics losing 1 percent and LG Energy Solution and Hyundai Motor shedding more than 2 percent. Big banks were hit particularly hard, with an index tracking the financial sector dropping 5 percent, a reflection of general economic unease.</p><p>After a steep drop overnight, the won bounced from its lows. On Wednesday morning it was trading down by about 1 percent against the dollar since the initial declaration of martial law late Tuesday night.</p><p>Just before midnight on <a href="https://english.moef.go.kr/pc/selectTbPressCenterDtl.do?boardCd=N0001&amp;seq=6025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tuesday</a> and early in the morning on <a href="https://english.moef.go.kr/pc/selectTbPressCenterDtl.do?boardCd=N0001&amp;seq=6027" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wednesday</a>, South Korea’s finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, convened meetings in Seoul with officials from the central bank and key financial regulators. They pledged to meet daily to “establish a constant risk management system” and provide “unlimited liquidity support” until the stock, bond and currency markets stabilized.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Choi said on Wednesday that the government would focus on shielding the economy, and that officials would “closely communicate” with the authorities of other countries with major economies. “In any given situation, the government will do its best to address economic concerns and to minimize disruptions in entrepreneurial and daily activities,” he said.</p><p>The Bank of Korea called an emergency meeting on Wednesday “given the underlying anxiety in financial and foreign exchange markets,” it said <a href="https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/E0000634/view.do?nttId=10088408&amp;searchCnd=1&amp;searchKwd=&amp;depth=400007&amp;pageUnit=10&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;programType=newsDataEng&amp;menuNo=400423&amp;oldMenuNo=400007" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a>. The central bank said it would “actively” take various measures to calm markets and currency fluctuations.</p><p>“With the solid fundamentals of the Korean economy and its robust external soundness, market sentiment is expected to gradually stabilize,” the bank said. Officials <a href="https://www.bok.or.kr/eng/bbs/E0000634/view.do?nttId=10088272&amp;searchCnd=1&amp;searchKwd=&amp;depth2=400417&amp;depth3=400423&amp;depth=400423&amp;pageUnit=10&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;programType=newsDataEng&amp;menuNo=400423&amp;oldMenuNo=400423" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unexpectedly cut interest rates</a> last week, citing “heightened uncertainties surrounding growth and inflation, driven by the new U.S. administration’s policies.”</p><p>As opposition lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/03/world/south-korea-martial-law" title="">demanded</a> that President Yoon step down, analysts and investors were trying to gauge how long South Korea’s outbreak of political turmoil would persist.</p><p>Market, consumer and business sentiment will likely “take a significant hit” for some time, as it did in 2017, when South Korea’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html" title="">president</a> was impeached, said Min Joo Kang, a senior economist at ING.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>South Korea’s credit rating could also be affected, though that is uncertain at this stage, Ms. Kang said in a note.</p><p>“South Korea’s democratic institutions and culture have withstood the stress test,” Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, wrote in a note. He expected “minimal” disruption to business and supply chains, “but it is extraordinary and troubling that it happened at all,” he added.</p><p>Elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region, markets remained relatively calm. Benchmark indexes in Japan, and Australia fell by less than 1 percent on Wednesday. Hong Kong’s main index gained slightly.</p><p>Minho Kim<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jason Karaian is the business news director, based in London.
