    <h1>Banks Are Racking Up Wins Even Before Trump Is Back in White House</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Banks are on a winning streak, one that’s poised to intensify as President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.</p><p>Biden-appointed regulators at the Federal Reserve and other agencies presided over a relatively fruitless era of bank oversight. They tried to enact stricter rules for the nation’s biggest banks, hoping to create a stronger safety net for the financial system even if it cut into bank profits.</p><p>But the rules were considered so onerous — including by some top Fed officials — that they died of their own ambitions.</p><p>As proposals stalled, the foundation for existing bank oversight became increasingly shaky thanks to bank-friendly courts. During his first term, Mr. Trump appointed a slate of conservative judges who then slowly but significantly shifted the legal environment against strict federal oversight.</p></div></div>
