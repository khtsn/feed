Trump’s White House aides had to testify before a grand jury in Washington that charged him with plotting to overturn the 2020 election, showing how judges carved out limits on executive privilege.</p><p>The trove — including motions, judicial orders and transcripts of hearings in Federal District Court in Washington — did not reveal significant new details about Mr. Trump’s efforts to cling to power. But it did open a window on important questions of presidential power and revealed how judges grew frustrated with Mr. Trump’s longstanding strategy of seeking to delay accountability for his attempts to overturn his defeat to Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>The documents also created important — if not binding — precedents about the scope of executive privilege that could influence criminal investigations in which a current or former president instructs subordinates not to testify before a grand jury based on his constitutional authority to keep certain internal executive branch communications secret.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Starting in the summer of 2022, and continuing with the appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel later that year, the Justice Department undertook a wide-ranging and extraordinary effort to compel grand jury testimony from several close aides to Mr. Trump. Prosecutors believed the aides had critical information about the former president’s attempts to overturn the results of the election.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The effort, which ended in the spring of the following year, was largely intended to obtain firsthand accounts from key figures who had used claims of executive privilege and other legal protections to avoid testifying to investigators on the House committee that examined the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the events leading up to it.</p><p>The documents show that two chief judges of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia — first Judge Beryl A. Howell, and then Judge James E. Boasberg when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/us/politics/trump-judge-james-boasberg.html" title="">succeeded her</a> in March 2023 — rejected the executive privilege claims by Mr. Trump and his allies.</p><p>As one witness after another tried to spurn grand jury subpoenas or showed up but then refused to answer questions, the judges ruled that the grand jury’s need for the information in a criminal inquiry overcame the executive privilege shield.</p><p>In one previously secret ruling in September 2022, for example, Judge Howell rejected Mr. Trump’s more expansive vision of presidential secrecy powers and his claim that the Jan. 6 investigation was not viable, saying that if there was insufficient evidence of a crime, that would be determined by the grand jury itself — or a trial jury.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Judicial intervention to prejudge the ‘viability’ of a grand jury investigation is an obvious usurpation of the grand jury’s role and is wholly inappropriate,” she wrote.</p><p>“Cutting off the grand jury investigation now by starving it of information,” she added, might spare Mr. Trump from having to persuade a trial jury that he and his associates “engaged merely in aggressive political maneuvering on multiple fronts and crossed no line into illegality, such as a criminal effort to obstruct Congress’s official proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.” But that line-drawing, she wrote, is “assigned under our criminal justice system, as an initial matter, to the grand jury.”</p><p>The documents were unsealed because of a lawsuit initially filed by The New York Times and Politico. After an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.248616/gov.uscourts.dcd.248616.18.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unfavorable ruling by Judge Howell</a> in February 2023, The Times dropped out of the litigation, but Politico filed an appeal.</p><p>In April, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24601562-politicocadcunsealord042324" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled</a> that while Judge Howell was correct to initially reject the unsealing request, subsequent revelations — like information unsealed when Mr. Trump was indicted — meant some of the filings could now be unsealed. The panel sent it back for reconsideration.</p><p>The Justice Department took the position that material that had already been discussed by the government in open court could be unsealed, and last week Judge Boasberg ordered it to release the documents with proposed redactions on Monday, saying he would consider whether to order more to be made public later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Even though the unsealed documents shed light on the steps in the process of compelling testimony from Mr. Trump’s aides, the names of the people who initially balked at appearing in front of the grand jury were redacted. Still, as a result of the unfiling, a series of five similar rulings — four by Judge Howell and one by Judge Boasberg — and their dates became public.</p><p>Judge Howell issued such rulings on Sept. 28, 2022; Nov. 19, 2022; Dec. 9, 2022; and March 15, 2023; and Judge Boasberg issued one on March 25, 2023. A grand jury in the District of Columbia returned the indictment in the federal election subversion case that August.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pat A.

Cipollone, Mr. Trump’s White House counsel; Patrick F. Philbin, Mr. Cipollone’s deputy; Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s final chief of staff; Dan Scavino, Mr. Meadows’s deputy; and former Vice President Mike Pence.</p><p>The testimony secured from these witnesses was instrumental not only in Mr. Smith’s ability to charge Mr. Trump with three intersecting conspiracy charges related to subverting the election, but also with filing an expansive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/02/us/trump-j6-sco-immunity-brief.html" title="">165-page brief</a> last month that defended the election charges against the Supreme Court’s recent ruling granting Mr. Trump broad immunity against accusations arising from his official acts as president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The documents also include several rulings rejecting motions for stays of orders to various people to testify while Mr. Trump appealed. Some included language chiding Mr. Trump’s legal team for pursuing a strategy of delay, such as by waiting until the last minute to file an appeal.</p><p>“The former president’s motion for stay is yet another conspicuous attempt to delay that investigation, which clear legal precedent counsels against tolerating,” Judge Howell wrote on Dec. 18, 2022, noting that Mr. Trump’s tactics had already stalled the inquiry by three months.</p><p>She added, “The court thus declines to further pause the grand jury’s constitutionally protected work, particularly in the absence of any reassurance that the former president’s delay tactics will cease.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
