Former President Donald J. Trump claimed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/technology/pennsylvania-election-disinformation.html" title="">“massive CHEATING” in Philadelphia</a> on Tuesday before the polls had even closed.</p><p>Then the results arrived, showing Mr. Trump with considerable strength. Voices that had spent years shouting about election integrity suddenly faded to a whisper.</p><p>“As soon as it started to look like Trump was going to win, the election denialism went very, very quiet,” said Welton Chang, a co-founder and the chief executive of <a href="https://www.pyrratech.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pyrra Technologies</a>, a company that <a href="https://cdn.mc-weblink.sg-mktg.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_sSw5pRE49ymRKnVgV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">monitors</a> fringe social networks.</p><p>The sudden hush of election deniers in the wake of Mr. Trump’s victory on Tuesday underscores the narrative’s longstanding purpose as a means for Mr. Trump to regain power and challenge election results, experts say. When denying the election’s outcome suddenly proved politically useless, the influencers and Trump allies seemed content to simply set it aside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The false notion that the 2020 election was stolen lived beyond social media as well, powering a broad movement of “election integrity” activists. For the past four years many of them had dedicated themselves to “fixing” the voting system to prevent a future “steal” — signing on as poll watchers, election workers and even election board members.</p><p>During the voting on Tuesday, several of the movement’s figures spread posts online that suggested activists were finding evidence of problems.</p><p>On Wednesday, however, one top leader portrayed Mr. Trump’s victory as a result of their work to improve the system.</p><p>“To the thousands of election integrity warriors: Thank you,” read a post on X on Wednesday from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/28/us/politics/inside-the-movement-behind-trumps-election-lies.html" title="">Cleta Mitchell</a>, one of the most prominent leaders of the movement.</p><p>In an interview later on Wednesday, Ms. Mitchell said the vigilance of her fellow activists had “kept a lot of the serious things that happened in 2020 from happening again.” Asked if she had a message for those who might view the acceptance of this year’s results as evidence of partisan motives, she said they needed to “get over their Trump derangement syndrome.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On X, false claims of widespread fraud in Pennsylvania and other swing states surged early on Election Day but then appeared to peter out as the night went on, according to an analysis by the <a href="https://www.cip.uw.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Center for an Informed Public</a> at the University of Washington.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="datawrapper_5DMv2" data-id="100000009812013" data-source-id="100000009812013"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Conversation About Pennsylvania Voting Machines</h2><p data-testid="leadin" id="interactive-leadin">Posts about voting machine errors in Pennsylvania — often tied to false claims of voter fraud — surged on X but soon subsided.</p></header><div slug="datawrapper_5DMv2" data-sourceid="100000009812013" id="embed-id-100000009812013">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Telegram, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/technology/telegram-right-wing-groups-election.html" title="">dozens of far-right channels identified by The New York Times</a> spent days leading up to the vote questioning its integrity and vowing to act with force if necessary to block what they viewed as a fraud. As the results rolled in, the tone shifted, warily at first and then gleefully.</p><p>“Most of our Proud Boy poll workers have returned home,” read one message posted at 6:35 in the evening from a North Carolina chapter of the extremist group, which was involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, violence on Capitol Hill. “Overwhelmingly they said despite what the media has told you, from what they saw today they are confident Trump will win North Carolina.”</p><p>Another prime example of the movement’s sudden shift Tuesday night involved a problem in Milwaukee. Social feeds filled with recriminations and suspicion after elections administrators there discovered that 13 ballot tabulators had been insufficiently secured ahead of counting.
