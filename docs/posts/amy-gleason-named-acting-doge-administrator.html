Mr. Musk, who is the world’s richest man and a key adviser to President Trump, has been clearly driving the initiative, including by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/us/politics/elon-musk-email-federal-employees.html" title="">instigating</a> an email to all federal employees on Saturday that instructed them to list their accomplishments during the last week.</p><p>But the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-leader.html" title="">has insisted</a> in court that Mr. Musk is not the administrator of the cost-cutting team, adding to the sense of opacity surrounding it. On Monday, a federal judge pressed the government for clarity about the billionaire’s role, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/politics/doge-elon-musk-lawsuits.html" title="">expressing concern</a> that unauthorized individuals were effectively running the office.</p><p>On Tuesday, a name was revealed: Ms. Gleason is the temporary leader of what is formally known as the U.S. DOGE Service, according to the White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump created the office on Inauguration Day through an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a>, transforming a White House tech unit that had been established under President Barack Obama. Since then, staffers hired by Mr. Musk and his aides have fanned across the government and sought access to sensitive databases, scrutinized federal employees and even tried to shutter whole agencies.</p><p>Ms. Gleason did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She was scheduled to be on vacation in Mexico on Tuesday and told associates that she was not aware ahead of time that the White House planned to make public her role, according to people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.</p><p>Ms. Gleason, a career official who worked at the digital service unit during Mr. Trump’s first term, rejoined the agency late last year, according to people familiar with her role and documents reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>During the first Trump administration, the digital agency — which stations tech workers throughout the federal government to assist with modernization efforts — had posted Ms. Gleason with the Health and Human Services Department, where she worked on Covid response, according to documents seen by The Times.</p><p>Ms. Gleason has focused on health care reforms, which she said during a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_gleason_a_360_view_of_patient_history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TEDx presentation</a> in 2020 was inspired by her frustrations with the medical system after her daughter was diagnosed with a rare illness. After Mr. Trump’s first term, she joined Brad Smith, a health care executive who had worked with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner on the Covid response, at an investment firm focused on health companies, taking the role of chief product officer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-brad-smith-trump.html" title="">Mr. Smith began advising Mr. Musk’s cost-cutting efforts</a> and eventually brought Ms. Gleason, who is based in Nashville, into the discussions, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p>On Dec. 30, more than three weeks before Inauguration Day, Ms. Gleason was reintroduced at the digital service office as a “new hire” on an internal Slack channel, according to documents viewed by The Times.</p><p>“My previous time at USDS was incredibly meaningful — full of challenges, successes, and unforgettable experiences,” Ms. Gleason wrote as part of a “new hire spotlight” document seen by The Times. “I’m excited to meet new colleagues and dive into impactful projects once again.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amy Gleason, in a still frame from a video made during her time in the health care industry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">What&#39;s the Fix?!, via YouTube</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In January, Ms. Gleason met regularly with Mr. Smith and Steve Davis, a top aide to Mr. Musk, at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where Mr. Musk has set up his DOGE offices, a person familiar with her work said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In recent weeks, Ms. Gleason has overseen the transition of the digital service agency into Mr. Musk’s operation. Through executive order, Mr. Trump moved it from the Office of Management and Budget, where it had been housed since its founding, into the White House — a transition that effectively shielded its work from open records laws that could give the public insight into its operations.</p><p>During an all-hands meeting with staffers last week, Ms. Gleason told employees that they should adopt a “one team” mentality and work closely with their new counterparts, including dozens of young engineers and lawyers Mr. Musk recruited to help him overhaul the federal bureaucracy.</p><p>But the takeover of the office has not gone smoothly. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/doge-civil-service-employees-quit-musk.html" title="">21 employees at U.S.D.S.</a> announced their resignations, protesting the incursion on the federal government by Mr. Musk and his allies.</p><p>“We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” the group wrote in its letter. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.”</p><p>Before Ms. Gleason’s role was revealed, reporters had urged the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, to name the agency’s administrator on Tuesday at a daily briefing for the news media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I’m not going to reveal the name of that individual from this podium,” Ms. Leavitt replied. “I’m happy to follow up and provide that to you. But we’ve been incredibly transparent about the way that DOGE is working.”</p><p>Theodore Schleifer<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Washington correspondent for The Times, focusing on the Trump administration and its efforts to transform the federal government.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div><div><p>Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.
