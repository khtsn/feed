Trump followed through on his threats to impose sky-high tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States.</p><p>“If you put 25 percents tariffs on me, I have to react with tariffs,” Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s economy minister, <a href="https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/2024/11/11/donald-trump-aranceles-mexico-marcelo-ebrard-responde-que-tambien-impondran-aranceles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> a radio interviewer on Monday. “Structurally, we have the conditions to play in Mexico’s favor,” he added.</p><p>The disclosure by Mr. Ebrard, who is poised to be one of Mexico’s top negotiators with the Trump administration, showcases the rising tensions between the countries in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election.</p><p>During his campaign, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-rally-in-raleigh-north-carolina-1e69a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a> to immediately place 25 percent tariffs on all goods from Mexico unless that country’s government halted the flow of migrants and drugs to the United States. If Mexico fails to respond to Mr. Trump’s satisfaction, he said, he could raise such tariffs to as high as 100 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Such moves could send shock waves through the economy of Mexico, which is exceptionally dependent on trade with the United States, exporting about 80 percent of its goods to its northern neighbor.</p><p>But an array of sectors in the United States, including farmers and manufacturers of semiconductors and chemicals, also relies on exporting to Mexico, which last year <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2023/0711" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eclipsed</a> China to become the largest trading partner of the United States.

Instead, she has said her government is eager to meet with Mr. Trump’s transition team before he takes office.</p><p>“It is important to get in touch, to know what they are thinking and to move forward in coordination as much as possible,” she told reporters on Monday. Ms. Sheinbaum and Mr. Trump had their first telephone call last week, which Mexico’s president described as “very cordial.”</p><p>The renewed tensions hark back to the start of the first Trump administration, which began using tariffs on imports from Canada, China, Mexico and the European Union. In 2018, shortly after Mr. Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum, several countries taxed various other products from the United States. Mexico was among them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico with Marcelo Ebrard, the economic minister, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuri Cortez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Enrique Peña Nieto, then Mexico’s president, launched a two-pronged retaliation.

Mr. López Obrador and Mr. Trump had a smooth relationship throughout the remainder of Mr. Trump’s first term as Mexico increased enforcement of U.S. immigration restrictions and the United States largely refrained from interfering in Mexico’s domestic affairs.</p><p>When reporters <a href="https://x.com/MLopezSanMartin/status/1854624451918176528" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked</a> Mr. Ebrard, the economy minister, last week about how the government should respond to Mr. Trump’s threats, he pointed to his own experience at that time and said, “With cold blood and intelligence.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Simon Romero is a Times correspondent covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
