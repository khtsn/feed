And there’s more to come: Mayor Anne Hidalgo plans to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2023/07/12/swimming-in-paris-seine-3-new-sites-get-go-ahead/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open three public swimming spots on the Seine</a> by next summer, and similar projects are in the works in Boston, London and Amsterdam.</p><p>But these plans to develop “blue infrastructure” — which can help cool cities, promote biodiversity and improve quality of life — won’t be the first. Here are six European cities that have successfully opened up their waterways for swimming.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2dd11b">Paris</h2><p><em>Dip into floating swimming pools filled with filtered canal water.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Freshwater pools at the Bassin de la Villette, a large artificial lake at the northeastern edge of Paris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some Parisians can still remember a time when the banks of the Seine were lined with floating swimming pools — with views of the Pont Neuf and the National Assembly. (The Piscine Deligny was built on a floating barge in the Seine in the late 1700s; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/sink-and-swim-1483733.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it sank in 1993</a>.)</p><p>Parisians have been able to swim in the Bassin de la Villette, a large artificial lake at the northeastern edge of the city, since 2017, when the first freshwater pools opened there. Every year from July to September, as part of a riverside festival known as <a href="https://parisjetaime.com/eng/article/paris-plages-a962" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paris Plages</a>, locals head to the pools, where the water is tested daily for bacteria levels before swimmers are let in.</p><p>Entry to the swimming facilities, which include showers, changing rooms, umbrellas and deck chairs, is free, but capacity is limited to 200 people at a time.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-5ca16bad">Copenhagen</h2><p><em>Check out the harbor baths, diving boards and bathing clubs.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Sandkaj harbor bath, in Copenhagen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Charlotte de la Fuente for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Copenhagen’s harbor was once polluted with sewage, industrial waste and oil spills. But the Danish capital has slowly evolved into one of the best cities for year-round swimmers — and, come rain or shine, Copenhagen residents now take dips in the many swimming spots along the harbor, where saunas have proliferated and have helped popularize winter bathing.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Copenhagen undertook a project to make swimming a part of everyday life. The city invested in modernizing its sewage system, rerouting wastewater into underground basins and expanding wastewater treatment plants. The harbor is still a busy waterway, so swimming outside designated bathing areas is not permitted and could incur a fine.</p><p>In 2002, the first havnebad (“harbor bath”) was inaugurated at <a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/planning/islands-brygge-harbour-bath-gdk482346" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Islands Brygge</a>, just across the bridge from the city center, where locals can swim in five different pools or jump from three diving boards. Among many other swimming spots is the year-round <a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/planning/sandkaj-swimming-zone-gdk1110377" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sandkaj Harbor bath</a> in the new Nordhavn neighborhood, a former industrial port. Copenhagen’s winter bathing clubs have doubled their membership numbers since 2015, and last year, the city opened its <a href="https://www.wonderfulcopenhagen.com/wonderful-copenhagen/international-press/international-press/winter-bathing-copenhagen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first public saunas</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-1bd36">Oslo</h2><p><em>Enjoy beaches and floating saunas where shipbuilding once reigned.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bathers leaping from a floating sauna near Operastranda, or Opera Beach.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alejandro Villanueva for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>As with Copenhagen, swimming in Oslo’s harbor was once unthinkable. But as the shipbuilding industry diminished, the city decided to transform the waterfront and open it up to the public.</p><p>Beginning in 2000, a project known as Fjord City redeveloped the old port areas and created parks and public spaces. A few years later, a cleanup project began to address pollution in the city’s inner harbor. Keeping the water clean has become a matter of local pride, with <a href="https://www.fjordcleanup.no/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">volunteers holding regular cleanups</a> — on foot, in kayaks and by diving to collect garbage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Beaches and swimming spots are now open throughout the city center, including at Operastranda (“Opera Beach”), a 330-foot-long sandy shore that opened in 2021 in the newly revitalized Bjorvika neighborhood. A short walk away, <a href="https://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?tlp=3067313&amp;name=Sorenga-Seawater-Pool" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sorenga Sjobad</a>, which opened in 2015 with a small sandy beach, offers a diving tower, showers and toilets, and an eight-lane seawater pool.</p><p>As swimming has become an essential part of daily life, saunas have also popped up. There are now 14 floating saunas open year-round along the waterfront — though the city’s first, an informal structure built in 2011, was initially banned by the port authorities.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-64fb704">London</h2><p><em>Soak in natural bathing ponds and the Serpentine Lido.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cooling off at a pond in Hampstead Heath park.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carlos Jasso/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>A recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/30/english-rivers-pollution-sewage-agriculture-uk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">citizen-led water testing project</a> showed that 83 percent of English rivers contained evidence of high pollution caused by sewage and agricultural waste. In recent years, though, a growing <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210603-why-wild-swimming-is-britains-new-craze" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“wild swimming” movement</a> has raised awareness of the importance of cleaning them up. Inspired by Paris, Mayor Sadiq Kahn of London has <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/04/23/is-the-thames-safe-to-swim-in-london-mayor-sadiq-khan-vows-to-make-it-so-by-2034" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promised to make the River Thames clean enough for swimming</a> in the next decade, and the news has been welcomed by many Londoners for whom swimming is part of everyday life.</p><p>Swimming at Hampstead Heath, in <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath/activities-at-hampstead-heath/swimming-at-hampstead-heath" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the ponds and the Parliament Hill Lido</a>, is a cherished tradition — as is swimming at the <a href="https://www.royalparks.org.uk/visit/parks/hyde-park/serpentine-lido" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serpentine Lido in Hyde Park</a>. The ponds at Hampstead became informal swimming spots soon after they were dug as freshwater reservoirs in the late 17th century; in the late 19th century, designated ponds for men and women were created, providing a connection with nature and an escape from city life. They continue to attract a loyal following, and have been the subject of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/At-Pond-Swimming-Hampstead-Ladies/dp/1911547399" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">books</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/the-ponds-review-deep-dive-into-hampstead-heaths-swimming-culture" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documentaries</a>.</p><p>In 2020, the City of London Corporation, which manages the ponds, began collecting compulsory fees, and a major investment has recently been made to make them more accessible, installing hoists for disabled people, new toilets and shower facilities, including hot showers at Kenwood Ladies’ Pond.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-6a45555">Munich</h2><p><em>Explore an Alpine river and its gravelly banks.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The banks of the Isar River.

The $38 million restoration, which took 11 years to complete, significantly improved flood protection and water quality and opened up a five-mile stretch of river for swimming.</p><p>There are now several spots that are well suited for a swim in the city. On hot summer days, locals gather for barbecues on the gravelly banks of the river in <a href="https://www.munich.travel/en/pois/sports-leisure/munich-s-most-popular-recreation-area" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Flaucher</a>, while those seeking a quieter spot can swim across the shallow waters to Weideninsel (Willow Island), which was formed during the restoration work.</p><p>Another river, the Eisbach, is home to an unlikely surfing attraction.

In 1986, the river turned red after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/11/world/huge-chemical-spill-in-the-rhine-creates-havoc-in-four-countries.html" title="">giant spill at a chemical storage warehouse</a>, which precipitated a major environmental disaster. The spill prompted new legislation and investment in cleanup efforts. In the aftermath, the Swiss government focused on building new sewer systems, wastewater treatment plants and other facilities to direct wastewater away from its rivers, and Switzerland has led the way in urban swimming, with cities such as Zurich, Bern and Geneva expanding swimming infrastructure in its rivers.</p><p>In Basel, the Rhine remains an important commercial route. But today its fast-flowing waters are <a href="https://www.basel.com/en/activities-excursions/swimming-rhine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regularly inspected and widely used for swimming</a>. Locals put their belongings in <a href="https://www.basel.com/en/activities-excursions/swimming-rhine/wickelfisch" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">waterproof bags</a> — which are designed specifically for the city to promote swimming in the river — before jumping in and letting the current take them downstream.</p><p>Bathing houses like the <a href="https://www.basel.com/en/attractions/rhine-bath-breite-18317bb9db" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rheinbad Breite</a> offer sunbathing areas, showers and changing rooms as well as a restaurant, while buvettes (kiosks serving spritzes and snacks) have popped up on the banks of the river since the redevelopment of the Kleinbasel area.
