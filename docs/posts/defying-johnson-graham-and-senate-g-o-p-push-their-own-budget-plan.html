But, he told Mr. Johnson, the Senate would press ahead with its own bill, adding, “We are living on borrowed time.”</p><p>Senate Republicans had waited for weeks for their House colleagues to resolve their differences and agree to a budget blueprint that could unlock the party’s push to pass a vast fiscal package with only a simple majority vote. But even as House Republicans put forth their own plan on Wednesday calling for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, they remain divided over major issues, including how deeply to cut federal programs to pay for the bill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Enter Mr. Graham, the fast-talking fourth-term Republican senator from South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.</p><p>A loyal Trump ally who has long relished the opportunity to be in the middle of the action, Mr. Graham has made it clear in recent days that he has no intention of waiting for the House. Instead, Mr. Graham has advanced a budget plan that his committee is set to take up on Wednesday that would increase spending for the military and border security measures. He has promised that another bill extending the 2017 tax cuts will come later.</p><p>“The problem we have now is that ICE is running out of money,” Mr. Graham said on Wednesday, referring to the immigration enforcement agency as his committee began considering his budget plan. “And to my colleagues in the House: I hope you can pass one big, beautiful bill, meeting the priorities of President Trump and what we’ve been promising to do as a party. But we’ve got to move on this issue.”</p><p>His decision to plow ahead has crystallized a strategic clash between the Senate and the House that could have major consequences for the president’s agenda. In the House, G.O.P. leaders who have a razor-thin majority favor loading up a single bill with all of Mr. Trump’s policies, the better to pressure Republicans to put aside their reservations and vote for it. Mr. Johnson has said that the House would not take up the Senate’s narrower budget blueprint, telling reporters it would be a “nonstarter.”</p><p>Senate leaders have insisted on moving their own product anyway, reflecting both an urgency to deliver Mr. Trump an early political win on the border and deep skepticism that the notoriously fractious House G.O.P. conference will be able to quickly put together legislation that can pass.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We have a sense of urgency in the Senate to move forward now,” Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Republican, said in a brief interview. “If the House can do the whole thing now, great. It does seem that they’re not there yet.”</p><p>The blueprint that Mr. Graham has unveiled is fairly bare-bones. It would increase military spending by $150 billion. Spending on border security measures, including additional detention beds and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, would increase by $175 billion. It does not lay out specific spending cuts, but Mr. Graham has indicated that the legislation — which he anticipates would increase annual spending by $85.5 billion — would be fully paid for, in part through new revenues from domestic drilling.</p><p>He has not specified how much of that new spending would be offset by new revenue versus cuts to federal programs.</p><p>Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, and Russell T. Vought, who leads the Office of Management and Budget, told Republican senators in a closed-door luncheon on Tuesday that they urgently needed that money to secure the border.</p><p>It is a markedly different approach from what G.O.P. leaders are toiling to put together in the House. With conservative hard-liners agitating for their bill to contain major spending cuts, top Republicans have worked to identify broadly palatable measures that would offset at least some of the<strong> </strong>cost of tax extensions and other fiscal policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“There is no animus or daylight between us,” Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Graham. “We all are trying to get to the same achievable objectives. And there’s just different ideas on how to get there. But I told my good friend Lindsey that I have to manage the House in the best and only way it can be managed, and that they’re going to have to give us a little more patience.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“There is no animus or daylight between us,” Speaker Mike Johnson said of Mr. Graham. “We all are trying to get to the same achievable objectives.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samuel Corum for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The House Budget Committee released its own plan on Wednesday that would add more than $3 trillion to the deficit over a decade while cutting $1.5 trillion in federal spending, much of it from health care and food programs for the poor. It also calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, and for raising the debt ceiling, the statutory cap on what the nation can borrow to finance its debt, by $4 trillion.</p><p>Passing that blueprint on the House floor — and laying out exactly which programs to cut — will be a treacherous balancing act. A number of the provisions House Republicans want to include in their legislation cost trillions of dollars, including extending the 2017 tax cuts and eliminating taxes on tips. Republican lawmakers had considered putting forth a $4.7 trillion budget for cutting taxes.</p><p>Representative Jason Smith, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that sum would barely cover extending the tax cuts enacted under Mr. Trump in 2017 and would not be enough to cover the new tax policies the president has told Republicans to implement, like eliminating taxes on tips.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>To offset the costs of those measures, Republicans will eventually have to put forward specific, politically fraught cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps, moves that could alienate the more centrist, politically vulnerable lawmakers in frontline districts.</p><p>But even those spending reductions may be insufficient to satisfy some in the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus. Lawmakers in the caucus earlier this week called for $2.5 trillion in spending cuts, making the case in a statement that “we should not be negotiating with ourselves on how little to cut from Joe Biden’s insane spending levels.”</p><p>With House Republicans tied in knots over their own blueprint, Senate Republicans have become convinced that their strategy will ultimately prevail.</p><p>“All I can tell my House colleagues: Whatever you need to do to get the one beautiful bill, do it. Do it now,” Mr. Graham said on Tuesday. “You have my blessing. You have my support. But if we can’t do it quickly, we need to go to Plan B.”</p><p>Andrew Duehren<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Catie Edmondson covers Congress for The Times.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>FEMA:</strong> The Trump administration fired the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s chief financial officer and three others after Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/nyregion/fema-fired-nyc-migrant-hotels.html">misleadingly claimed the agency had used disaster relief funds for migrant services</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> A group of nongovernmental organizations, contractors and small businesses that rely on American foreign aid to carry out humanitarian and development programs abroad <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-usaid-lawsuit-foreign-aid.html">filed a lawsuit in federal court</a> against the Trump administration and its efforts to phase out the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fired Workers:</strong> Eight former inspectors general who were summarily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/trump-inspectors-general-fired.html">fired by President Trump</a> last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/inspectors-general-trump-lawsuit.html">filed a lawsuit</a> asking a judge to declare their removals illegal and order the government to reinstate them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Executive Power:</strong> Trump’s early moves to slash the federal government and expand American territory represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-ideology-power.html">significant ideological swings from his first term</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:</strong> Barely two days after Russell Vought, the new acting director, ordered the agency to close its office and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/business/vought-cfpb-musk-trump.html">halt all its work</a>, employees were in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/cfpb-shutdown-confusion.html">state of deep confusion</a> about what they should — or should not — be doing.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
