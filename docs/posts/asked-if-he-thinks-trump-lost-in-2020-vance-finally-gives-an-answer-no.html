    <h1>Asked if He Thinks Trump Lost in 2020, Vance Finally Gives an Answer: No</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the time, he pointed to state court rulings concerning elements of how Pennsylvania had conducted its election, even though none of those rulings called the results into question.</p><p>But he stumbled during the vice-presidential debate on Oct. 1 when questioned about Mr. Trump’s claims that he won in 2020, trying to pivot to claims about censorship. And when Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, asked point-blank whether Mr. Trump lost, Mr. Vance avoided the question entirely.</p><p>“Tim, I’m focused on the future,” Mr. Vance said. Mr. Walz called it a “damning non-answer.”</p><p>Since then, Mr. Vance has appeared frustrated by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/jd-vance-trump-2020.html" title="">repeated queries</a> about 2020, including in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/magazine/jd-vance-interview.html" title="">interview</a> with The New York Times published last week, when he evaded the question five times.</p><p>During that interview, Mr. Vance suggested Mr. Trump would have won more votes in 2020 had social media companies not <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/us/politics/hunter-biden-ukraine-facebook-twitter.html" title="">limited posts about a New York Post story</a> about the contents of a laptop that belonged to Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son. Trump allies had maintained that documents on the laptop linked President Biden to corrupt business dealings, but those claims were unfounded.</p><p>Mr. Vance repeated those claims on Wednesday.</p><p>“What verifiably I know happened,” Mr. Vance said, “is that in 2020, large technology companies censored Americans from talking about things like the Hunter Biden laptop.”</p></div></div>
