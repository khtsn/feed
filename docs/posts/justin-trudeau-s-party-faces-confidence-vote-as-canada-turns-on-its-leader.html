    <h1>Justin Trudeau’s Party Faces Confidence Vote as Canada Turns on Its Leader</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Canadian politics are getting fiery.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the young scion of a Liberal family who swept the global political scene off its feet a decade ago, is now a 52-year-old leader with approval ratings worse than President Biden’s.</p><p>He is rapidly losing ground to the Conservative Party’s leader, Pierre Poilievre, who, despite having vague policy plans, has deployed punchy sloganeering that has kept Mr. Trudeau on the ropes.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Liberal Party is set to face a vote of no confidence in Parliament. While the vote is expected to fail, it is a sign of deepening trouble as the party — like Mr. Trudeau — teeters months away from a general election.</p><p>After years of high inflation, soaring housing costs and an overstretched public health system, Mr. Trudeau <a href="https://angusreid.org/trudeau-tracker/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faces abysmal polling numbers</a>. Fewer than a third of Canadians believe he’s doing a good job. More than 70 percent say <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/70-percent-of-canadians-think-canada-broken-as-canadian-pride-takes-tumble" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canada is “broken”</a> under his leadership.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Poilievre, who uses tough rhetoric and promotes himself as a common-sense solution finder, has led Conservatives to a double-digit lead over the Liberals — even though many Canadians recently told pollsters that they wouldn’t be able to pick him out of a lineup.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre, 45, likes to keep his messages under three words, and they usually rhyme or are alliterative: “Spike the hike!” “Axe the tax!”</p><p>He and his team use social media heavily, borrowing tactics and tone from Donald J. Trump’s playbook, and often deploy incendiary language that feels out of place in Canada’s political discourse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Mr. Trudeau speaking and gesturing with his right hand while people wearing suits listen in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt/25canada-trudeau-02-zbmt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trudeau speaking while Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, pretends to play a violin in the background during a session last week in the House of Commons in Ottawa.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Blair Gable/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Trudeau is trying to stay above the fray. Despite his travails at home, he traveled to New York this week for the United Nations General Assembly, and on Monday he sat down for an interview with the late-night show host Stephen Colbert.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“People are frustrated, and the idea that maybe they want an election now is something that my opponents are trying to bank on, because people are taking a lot out on me for understandable reasons,” Mr. Trudeau told Mr. Colbert.</p><p>“I’ve been here, and I’ve been steering us through all these things,’’ he said, “and people are sometimes looking at change.”</p><h3 id="link-4f0b3844"><span>We Need to Talk About Justin</span></h3><p>While Canada staged a solid economic recovery after the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is down to 2 percent from over 8 percent two years ago, those achievements have not earned Mr. Trudeau many political points.</p><p>Unemployment rates remain high, housing in major cities like Toronto is unaffordable and Mr. Trudeau’s government has been criticized for inviting too many foreigners to work in Canada over the past three years, putting pressure on infrastructure and services such as health care.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trudeau at a Liberal caucus this month in Nanaimo, British Columbia.  “People are frustrated,’’ Mr. Trudeau said on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Yet, Mr. Trudeau’s most serious liability could be that he has been in power for too long and that he has lost the ability to market one of his most distinctive attributes: optimism.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The government has come into trouble of its own making, in losing faith in its positive case for the country,” said Gerald Butts, the vice chairman of Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, and a former top adviser to Mr. Trudeau and his party. “They have been overwhelmed by the message that the country is broken and have not been able to say the opposite.”</p><p>High-profile departures from the Liberal Party also give a sense that allies are abandoning a wounded Mr. Trudeau.</p><p>This month, the Liberals lost the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/world/canada/trudeau-liberal-party-agreement.html" title="">backing</a> of a smaller party — the New Democrats — that had given them a majority in the lower house of Parliament. The loss has left the Liberals vulnerable to challenges by the Conservatives, including Wednesday’s vote of no confidence.</p><p>There has also been an exodus of officials and senior politicians from Mr. Trudeau’s party. The Liberals’ national campaign director resigned this month, citing personal reasons, and a minister resigned last week to seek local office, prompting a cabinet reshuffle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Months of bad news seem to be reaching a crescendo, as both allies and opponents of the Liberals agree that some policy failures and an inability to seize control of the narrative are dooming Mr. Trudeau’s prospects.</p><h3 id="link-5c2bf1a7"><span>Cruel Summer</span></h3><p>The summer months were especially brutal for Mr. Trudeau. In June, the Liberals lost what was widely regarded as a safe seat in a special election in Toronto; last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/americas/special-election-results-montreal-trudeau.html" title="">they lost another</a> special election in Montreal.</p><p>The shocking loss of seats long controlled by Mr. Trudeau’s party drove home the intense levels of voter dissatisfaction.</p><p>It’s a terrifying realization for a party that has dominated the Canadian political scene for a decade.</p><p>A general election must be held by October 2025, but is likely to come earlier given the precarity of the Liberals’ parliamentary minority. A federal budget that is expected to be voted on next spring could be a trigger if Mr. Trudeau cannot rally support to pass it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trudeau preparing to address a meeting at the United Nations on Sunday.

But as elections loom, it seems inevitable that he will need to address his unpopularity with voters. His approval rating was near 70 percent when he swept into power in 2015; today it hovers at 30 percent.</p><p>His fall from public favor tracks similar travails befalling other Western leaders who have been in power through post-pandemic inflation spikes and cost-of-living crises confronting the developed world.</p><p>Experts compared Mr. Trudeau to President Emmanuel Macron of France, another young liberal who came to power amid palpable optimism a decade ago and now faces crushing discontent at home.</p><p>But Mr. Macron can’t run for office again because of term limits. Canada doesn’t have limits, and Mr. Trudeau seems bent on leading the Liberals to the ballot box again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Setting aside the specific issues weakening Mr. Trudeau and his party, analysts say that making the case for another term — his fourth — would still be a stretch because voters often tire of leaders who stay in power for so long.</p><p>“Even if everything was going swimmingly for the Liberals right now, it was always going to be a challenge,” said Shachi Kurl, the president of the Angus Reid Institute, a nonpartisan polling and research firm.</p><p>“But things are not going swimmingly,” she added. “Since 2021, it’s as though the Trudeau government has had the reverse Midas touch: Everything they touch is turning to not gold.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters gathering in Montreal in March to criticize the government’s policy regarding undocumented immigrants.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mathiew Leiser/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The aversion that many voters feel toward the Liberals does seem to be personal to Mr. Trudeau — but Ms. Kurl said it was unlikely that the party would turn to a new leader in the next election, partly out of a sense of loyalty.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“Trudeau is the Liberals,” she said, noting that the party feels a collective sense of gratitude for Mr. Trudeau for leading it to victory in 2015 after a stretch of poor electoral performances.</p><h3 id="link-5a83fb95"><span>Pithy Pierre</span></h3><p>At the same time, Mr. Trudeau’s chief political opponent, Mr. Poilievre, is working to brand himself as the anti-Trudeau: practical and down-to-earth.</p><p>One online <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/recognize-political-leaders-canada-abacus-data-poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll</a> showed that about a third of Canadians wouldn’t be able to name Mr. Poilievre from looking at his photo but many would still consider voting for him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Poilievre, the Conservative Party’s leader, has sought to position himself as the anti-Trudeau: practical and down-to-earth.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Blair Gable/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p> “There is no doubt that Poilievre is the best communicator Trudeau has ever faced,” Mr. Butts said.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre also markets himself as better suited to tackle the country’s problems, said David Coletto, who runs Abacus Data, a Canadian polling and research firm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“Canadians are not looking for celebrity and flashiness,” he said. “They want somebody who’s going to put out the fire, who’s going to solve the problems.”</p><p>For his part, Mr. Trudeau has said that Mr. Poilievre is simply all talk.</p><p>“He will do anything to win, anything to torque up negativity and fear,” he said in April, “and it only emphasizes that he has nothing to say to actually solve the problems that he’s busy amplifying.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>An Irish Bishop’s Secrets: </strong>The funeral of Bishop Eamonn Casey in 2017 seemed to draw a line under his scandalous affair years before.
