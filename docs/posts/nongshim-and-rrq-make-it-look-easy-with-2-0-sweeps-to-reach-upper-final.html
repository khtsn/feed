<p>The series opened on FULL SENSE&#39;s pick of Split, a map it has now played in all three of its Pacific Kickoff matches so far. Meanwhile, Nongshim, also playing the map for the third time, having picked it in both previous matches, went with a similar comp, with the only difference being <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/31827/dambi">
		Dambi	</a>
</span> on his iconic Neon instead of Raze.</p>

<p>Nongshim opened the map on attack and came out with loads of momentum. The squad won four of the first five rounds while claiming the first of three pistol rounds it ended up winning. FULL SENSE managed to remain steady, managing to even the odds by halftime on a map that had razor-thin margins.</p>

<p>Despite giving up a thrifty after winning the opening pistol of the second half, FULL SENSE remained strong on its own attack half, stringing together a few rounds to reach map point up 12-9. From that point, Nongshim used a variety of barrier-drop sequences and found the balance between being proactive and reactive. Former IGL-turned-Yoru player <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/31828/francis">
		Francis	</a>
</span> was at the center of those rounds, willing Nongshim to overtime, where more well-coordinated play helped Nongshim steal FS&#39;s map pick.</p>


<p><em>Nongshim steals FULL SENSE&#39;s map pick in flawless fashion.</em></p>

<p>Despite finding the first blood in 16 of the map&#39;s 26 rounds, FULL SENSE was unable to convert in many of those man-advantage situations. Dambi&#39;s 1.29 rating and 23 kills were server-high marks on the map, while in-game leader <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13788/jitboys">
		JitBoyS	</a>
</span>&#39; 22 kills and five first bloods were not enough for the Thai squad.</p>

<p>Attention then turned to Bind, which has arguably been one of the team&#39;s most iconic maps since its days as <span data-ref-id="10">

</span>. Once again, both teams had near-mirror comps, retaining the same agents from their Split game but switching out Omen for Brimstone.</p>

<p>Once again, Nongshim had a fast start to the map thanks to a pistol round win, snowballing its way to a 5-0 start to the map on defense. With momentum warming up into a boil, Nongshim only suffered two hiccups, dropping two rounds to FULL SENSE, but finding great success in large part thanks to Francis&#39;s Operator. He snagged eight of his 15 defense-side kills with the long-range sniper.</p>


<p><em>Even a three-player high-low setup couldn&#39;t stop Francis&#39;s Op.</em></p>

<p>Once on attack, it was business as usual for Nongshim, as a third pistol round win of the series willed Nongshim to a dominant 13-2 win on the map to secure an upper final spot.</p>

<p>After dropping a record-setting 79 kills in FS&#39;s win over DRX, <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/25255/primmie">
		primmie	</a>
</span> was held at bay by Nongshim, managing just 26 kills in the series. On the opposite side of the stage, Nongshim was led by Dambi&#39;s 38 kills, while Viper player <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/31829/ivy">

</span>, PRX claimed a 13-10 win on the map. PRX came out with a rather meta comp, with Yoru, Raze, Brimstone, Viper, and Fade. Meanwhile, RRQ went for an off-meta comp, putting lethal Operator user <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/24895/jemkin">
		Jemkin	</a>
</span> on Chamber while Skye served as the team&#39;s solo Initiator.</p>

<p>Immediately, a fast start saw RRQ seize a 5-0 lead. While the attacking PRX won five of the next six rounds to close the gap, it still trailed 7-5 at halftime. When attacking, RRQ played almost as if it were defending, finding the perfect counters to PRX&#39;s set plays, managing the space around the map&#39;s two teleports well, and shutting down any fast crunch attempts through them.</p>


<p><em>No ace, but no problem as <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4866/kushy">
		Kushy	</a>
</span>&#39;s four kills get RRQ to map point.</em></p>

<p>RRQ claimed another pistol round to open the second half, which spelled the beginning of the end for PRX. The <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a> champions managed just one round win on defense, unable to get a grasp on a slippery RRQ attack that brought the squad a 13-6 win.</p>

<p>With the loss, PRX found its back against the wall heading into Pearl, a map that it has struggled on over the past year, while RRQ has looked solid on it. RRQ opted for a double-Initiator comp that gave it plenty of post-plant utility while again allowing for Jemkin to flow freely on the Operator. Meanwhile, PRX remained with its double-Duelist look, which pivoted with <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7378/jinggg">
		Jinggg	</a>
</span> on Waylay as opposed to his usual comfort pick of Raze. PRX started on defense, but found itself on the back foot immediately.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t very many words that can be used to describe RRQ&#39;s dominance on attack. After claiming a third pistol round in the series, RRQ stormed forward to win the first ten rounds of the map. Paper Rex looked disjointed, being caught mismanaging its economy at times in an attempt to tip the scales in its favor. A slow, well-coordinated attack saw the RRQ players move in tandem with each other, with Jemkin finding several kills with the Outlaw against lighter PRX buys. </p>

<p>PRX won its first pistol round of the series in an attempt to mount a comeback, but a loss in the would-be bonus round spelled the beginning of the end. RRQ cruised, looking to be comfortable through the entire map and playing around PRX perfectly en route to a 13-5 win.</p>


<p><em>Kushy gets his ace stolen again, but it&#39;s a cost worth paying once again.</em></p>

<p>Jemkin had a series-high 38 kills with a 1.55 rating. Usually the team&#39;s Duelist player, he went 13-3 in first duels while <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/8497/monyet">
		Monyet	</a>
</span> put up a sizeable effort in the role with 34 of his own kills.</p>

<p>With a regional title already under its belt, a question can be raised as to whether or not this result is an upset. Regardless, RRQ now has the chance to qualify for its third-straight international event.</p>



<p>RRQ and Nongshim move on to the upper final, where they will both be one win away from reaching <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a>. Paper Rex and FULL SENSE both lose one life and will slide to the middle bracket, awaiting their next opponents.</p>
