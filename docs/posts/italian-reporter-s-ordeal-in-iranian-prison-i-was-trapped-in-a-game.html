Colleagues and friends told her Iran’s new government seemed more open to foreign reporters as it sought to repair relations with Europe.</p><p>Ms. Sala, 29, had not traveled to Iran since 2021, before an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/world/middleeast/women-iran-protests-hijab.html" title="">uprising</a> led by women and girls demanded an end to clerical rule. So she took a plane to Tehran, the capital.</p><p>“I wanted to see with my eyes what had changed,” she said in an interview recently in Rome.</p><p>Instead, she got firsthand experience of what had not changed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Dec. 19, as she was preparing an episode of an Italian podcast that she hosts every day, two agents from the intelligence wing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps came to her hotel room in Tehran.
