McGinnis, an illustrator whose lusty, photorealistic artwork of curvaceous women adorned more than 1,200 pulp paperbacks, as well as classic movie posters for “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” featuring Audrey Hepburn with a cigarette holder, and James Bond adventures including “Thunderball,” died on March 10 at his home in Old Greenwich, Conn. He was 99.</p><p>His family confirmed the death.</p><p>Mr. McGinnis’s female figures from the 1960s and ’70s flaunted a bold sexuality, often in a state of semi undress, whether on the covers of detective novels by John D. MacDonald or on posters for movies like “Barbarella” (1968), with a bikini-clad Jane Fonda, or Bond films starring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/movies/sean-connery-dead.html" title="">Sean Connery</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/movies/roger-moore-dead-james-bond.html" title="">Roger Moore</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/16/multimedia/16McGinnis--02-tcvq/16McGinnis--02-tcvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/16/multimedia/16McGinnis--02-tcvq/16McGinnis--02-tcvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/16/multimedia/16McGinnis--02-tcvq/16McGinnis--02-tcvq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A poster with &#34;Barbarella&#34; written in capital red letters and a drawing of a woman in boots and a bodysuit holding a ray gun in space with several faces superimposed in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/16/multimedia/16McGinnis--02-tcvq/16McGinnis--02-tcvq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/16/multimedia/16McGinnis--02-tcvq/16McGinnis--02-tcvq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/16/multimedia/16McGinnis--02-tcvq/16McGinnis--02-tcvq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 680w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/16/multimedia/16McGinnis--02-tcvq/16McGinnis--02-tcvq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1359w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/83e52c7e-4c48-594c-91ce-9dc579cb7783" decoding="async" width="600" height="904"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paramount, via Corbis/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><hr/><p>Beginning in 1958, he painted book covers for espionage, crime, Western, fantasy and other genre series — generally cheap paperbacks meant to grab a male reader’s eye in a drugstore, only to be quickly read and discarded.</p><p>He was best known for illustrating detective series featuring the gumshoes Mike Shayne, Perry Mason and various shamuses in works by the prolific author Carter Brown. The femme fatales who adorned those covers became known collectively as “the McGinnis Woman.”</p><p>The McGinnis Woman was long legged, impossibly beautiful and sophisticated looking. Her curves were the pneumatic ideal of Playboy and Barbie, but her allure was never that of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/obituaries/hugh-hefner-dead.html" title="">Hugh Hefner’s</a> prized girl next door. She was a man-eater, sometimes topless, and was usually placed in the foreground while bumping the male character, the book’s protagonist, into a secondary role.</p><p>To pose for his paintings, Mr. McGinnis hired svelte models, including the young <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/books/shere-hite-dead.html" title="">Shere Hite</a>, who went on to write the wide-selling “The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality,” in 1976.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A collection of Mr. McGinnis’s work, “The Art of Robert E.
