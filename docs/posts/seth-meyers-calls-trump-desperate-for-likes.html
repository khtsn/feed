You know how independent voters are always looking for good information on the fifth-most-popular feature of a dying app. Why don’t you just hold a round table in the chat feature on Words with Friends?” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“But, sure, finally, someone speaking to the American voter who believes bacon is too expensive and nuclear war isn’t that bad.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-1258d45">The Punchiest Punchlines (V.P.

He’s like, ‘This is why I always sign a prenup.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“According to FiveThirtyEight, Tim Walz has a net favorability rating of plus 5, while JD Vance is at minus 9.4.

Yeah, and this is interesting — this is interesting — it’s the same bus the Democrats threw President Biden under.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Former Vice President Mike Pence said in a recent interview that he cannot endorse former President Trump because Trump wanted him to overturn the 2020 election, and he can’t endorse Kamala Harris because that’s third base, and he’s married.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Janet McTeer imitated what it was like to work with her “Kaos” co-star Jeff Goldblum on Wednesday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”</p></div></div><div><p><h2 id="link-1a7073d0">What We’re Excited About on Thursday Night</h2></p></div><div><div><p>Billie Eilish will take The Colbert Questionert on Thursday’s “Late Show.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Missy Elliott onstage at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Monday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alexis Smith</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The multifaceted music artist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/arts/music/missy-elliott-out-of-this-world-tour-review.html" title="">Missy Elliott’s first headlining tour in her 30-year career</a> is as exhilarating as it is visually and theatrically ambitious.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/seth-meyers">Seth Meyers</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/jimmy-fallon">Jimmy Fallon</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="push-what-to-watch" data-id="100000007731011" data-source-id="100000007731011"><div><!--
