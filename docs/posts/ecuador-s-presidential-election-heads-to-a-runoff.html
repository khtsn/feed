Mr. Noboa, 37, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate from one of Ecuador’s wealthiest families, rose unexpectedly in the polls to win election and serve out the remainder of Mr. Lasso’s term.</p><p>At stake is the direction the troubled nation of nearly 18 million will take as it grapples with drug-fueled violence and high unemployment, issues that have sent tens of thousands of Ecuadoreans to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-5d565dd0">Why is this election important?</h2><p>Five years ago, Mr. Noboa was a political unknown. He was elected to the country’s legislature in 2021 and served one term.</p><p>During the 2023 elections to replace Mr. Lasso, he rose from the bottom of the polls in the first round of voting to score a second-place victory after a strong debate performance. He then beat a leftist establishment candidate, Luisa González, in the second round.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A young supporter of the candidate Luisa González holding a banner with her image, in Quito on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. González is running again and represents the party of a powerful former president, Rafael Correa, a polarizing figure in Ecuador. Many voters express nostalgia over the low violence and strong economy that characterized his presidency, while others remember his authoritarian style and his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/americas/ecuador-correa-corruption-verdict.html" title="">conviction on corruption charges</a>.</p><p>For years Mr. Correa’s leftist movement has defined Ecuadorean politics, but some analysts say that if Mr. Noboa wins he has the potential to create a movement of his own.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Noboa’s party, which was formed less than a year ago, is predicted in polls to win about a third of the seats in the legislature — the same as Mr. Correa’s party.</p><h2 id="link-1c14c87f">Who are the top candidates?</h2><p>Mr. Noboa was first elected on the back of a desperate desire for change following an explosion of insecurity in Ecuador and a particularly bloody 2023 election cycle, including the assassination of another presidential candidate.</p><p>Though violence, along with unemployment, remain high, he has leaned on a deft social media strategy to project an image of youth and vigor that has captivated many of his constituents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters holding banners and cardboard cutouts of President Daniel Noboa of Ecuador during a campaign event on Wednesday in Quito, the capital.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In an effort to quell worsening violence and an outbreak of prison riots, Mr. Noboa last year imposed a state of internal armed conflict, allowing the military to patrol the streets and prisons.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He also sent the police into the Mexican Embassy in Quito, the capital, to arrest a politician seeking refuge from a prison sentence for corruption, in what was considered a brazen breach of diplomatic protocol. Some analysts saw the moves as an overreach of presidential authority and a threat to civil liberties.</p><p>But his supporters see him as a bold leader willing to break the rules and stand up to corrupt forces. In April, Ecuadoreans endorsed his hard-line approach when they approved a referendum enshrining the increased military presence into law.</p><p>“He has to be firm to make people respect him,” said Jessica Navarro, 34, a taxi driver in Quito.</p><p>Ms. González, the political opponent, has been defined by her relationship to Mr. Correa, who handpicked her to represent his party.</p><p>“When Rafael Correa was there, he really supported us a lot,” said Edgar Escobar, 28, a nursing student who is supporting Ms. González. “I would like to go back to that country that we had before.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But Ledy Zúñiga, a former justice minister who is running for the National Assembly with Ms. González’s party, pushed back against the notion that she represents the past.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ledy Zúñiga, a former justice minister who is running for the National Assembly, said Ecuador needed a governing team with “experience and technical knowledge.’’</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It is not about going back to the past,’’ she said. “People are still eight years later blaming the things that happen to a government that is no longer here.
