Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, told reporters traveling with the president that the costly relief effort so far could burn through much of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s funding for the rest of the year, leaving the agency unprepared for another major disaster this season unless Congress returns from recess to authorize more funds.</p><p>“We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have,” Mr. Mayorkas told reporters. “We are expecting another hurricane hitting — we do not have the funds, FEMA does not have the funds, to make it through the season.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said lawmakers would not return to Washington before the November election to consider an emergency spending package.</p><p>“We wouldn’t even conceivably have the request ready before we get back in November,” Mr. Johnson said in an interview, noting that it would take time to assess the damage and calculate the costs of recovery and rebuilding. “There’s no necessity for Congress to come back.”</p><p>After briefly meeting with a group of officials in South Carolina, including Senator Lindsey Graham and Governor Henry McMaster, Mr. Biden surveyed some of the hardest-hit portions of North Carolina from the air while rescue teams worked below. He flew over Asheville and Lake Lure, N.C., alongside the state’s governor, Roy Cooper, and Ashville’s mayor, Esther Manheimer.</p><p>The decision to observe the scene from the air was informed by the severe conditions on the ground, in which more than 1,200 personnel from FEMA and other agencies were still looking for survivors and racing to bring in food and fuel, Mr. Mayorkas told reporters.</p><p>“What he does not want to do is in any way impair or impede the rescue that we are providing,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While the president took in the destruction in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Augusta Emergency Operations Center in Georgia to thank a group of emergency medical workers assembled there.</p><p>“You do this work in these moments of crisis, around the clock, with an intention and with a level of care and love for community that is unmatched,” Ms. Harris told the group.</p><p>Mr. Biden will meet with officials in Florida and Georgia on Thursday.</p><p>The extent of the wreckage across the Southeast is still coming to light five days after Helene made landfall on Florida’s Gulf Coast. Across the mountains of southern Appalachia, many residents remain isolated by muddy debris and washed-out roads.</p><p>Though the storm did extensive damage in parts of Florida, many of the hardest-hit places were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/29/us/helene-path-map.html" title="">hundreds of miles from any coastline</a>. Floods and landslides rendered roads useless, turned downtowns into ghost towns and reduced entire neighborhoods to piles of rubble.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers and other rescuers are continuing to search for missing people across the region.
