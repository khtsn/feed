India accuses Pakistan of being involved in the terror attack, which Pakistan denies.</p><p>India has been making a case for carrying out military strikes on what it calls havens for terrorists in Pakistan. Pakistan has promised to respond in kind to any military action by India.</p><p>In recent days, exchanges of small-arms fire have broken out along the countries’ border, and a flurry of activity in New Delhi has suggested that an Indian strike could be imminent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met repeatedly with his military leaders, and his officials have continued to talk in public about taking action against Pakistan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a letter sent on Monday to all of the country’s states and territories, India’s home ministry ordered that drills be carried out to assess the public’s readiness for conflict. In 244 districts — identified as civil defense districts because they are near the border or the coast, or because of other perceived vulnerabilities — all villages will be required to conduct drills, the letter said.</p><p>The letter, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, said the drills should include testing air raid sirens and instructing civilians in how to navigate blackouts and carry out evacuations.</p><p>Similar drills have already been conducted near the border in recent days, particularly in Kashmir, where videos have showed schoolchildren being led through duck-and-cover drills and people cleaning bunkers meant to be used during airstrikes.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.</p></div><div><p>Hari Kumar covers India, based out of New Delhi.
