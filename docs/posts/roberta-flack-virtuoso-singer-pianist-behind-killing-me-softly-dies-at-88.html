In 1973, she and Donny Hathaway shared the award for best pop vocal performance by a duo, group or chorus, for “Where Is the Love.” A year later, she won in the pop vocal performance, female category for “Killing Me Softly.”</p><p>Ms. Flack’s steady, powerful voice could convey tenderness, pride, conviction or longing, but hardly ever despair. Most of her best-known albums included at least a few funk and soul tracks, driven by a slapping backbeat and rich with observational social commentary. But her biggest hits were always something else: slow folk ballads (“The First Time”) or mellifluous anthems (“Killing Me Softly”) or plush love songs (“Feel Like Makin’ Love”).</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“First Take” (1969) was Ms. Flack’s debut album.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atlantic</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway” (1972), an album of duets with her old friend from Howard University, was considered a creative high-water mark.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atlantic</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Roberta Flack underplays everything with a quietness and gentleness,” the writer and folklorist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/obituaries/julius-lester-chronicler-of-black-america-is-dead-at-78.html" title="">Julius Lester</a> once observed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080402063131/http:/www.rollingstone.com/artists/robertaflack/albums/album/129894/review/5942043/first_take/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Rolling Stone review</a>. “More than any singer I know, she can take a quiet, slow song (and most of hers are) and infuse it with a brooding intensity that is, at times, almost unbearable.”</p><p>Mr. Lester heard in Ms. Flack an “amazing ability to get further inside a song than one thought humanly possible and to bring responses from places inside you that you never knew existed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-10"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Roberta Flack, ‘Killing Me Softly’ Singer, Dies at 88</h2><h4>As a Grammy Award-winning singer and pianist, Roberta Flack topped the charts as one of the most popular artists of the 1970s.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>Singing: “Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly.” When I recorded “Killing Me Softly” in 1972, I had the same kind of goosebumps.

In its poise, its interiority and conviction, its lack of sentimentality or overstatement, her singing seemed to press the reset button on any standard expectations of a pop star. She placed equal priority on passion and clear communication — like an instructor speaking to an inquisitive student, or a lover pledging devotion.</p><p>“I’ve been told I sound like Nina Simone, Nancy Wilson, Odetta, Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, even Mahalia Jackson,” Ms. Flack <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/29/archives/robertas-a-capital-find.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> in 1970. “If everybody said I sounded like one person, I’d worry. But when they say I sound like them all, I know I’ve got my own style.”</p><p>Preternaturally gifted and bookish, Ms. Flack entered college at 15 and graduated while still a teenager. But her musical career blossomed slowly; by the time she found the spotlight, she was well into her 30s and had only recently quit teaching junior high school.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>At a small Capitol Hill club called <a href="http://www.mrhenrysdc.com/about-us/#history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Henry’s</a>, she had spent years developing an eclectic repertoire of about 600 songs and a riveting, unpretentious stage presence. Even when her fame exploded and her beauty shone on the international stage, Ms. Flack never became larger than life or shed the persona of an earnest, wise-beyond-her-years schoolteacher.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Flack in an undated photo.

OK, darlin’, you go right on and keep giving it what you’ve got left, and the audience ignores it and goes right along with you. I’ve found out the way to get myself through to people is just to unzip myself and let everything hang out.”</p><p>Ms. Flack belonged to a broad and continuing tradition of singer-pianists — Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Alicia Keys — whose music is equally rooted in the blues, the Black church and Western classical music, and who have consistently challenged the strictures imposed by commercial genre.</p><p>She saw no need to choose between a broad, accessible repertoire and a proud Afrocentrism, steeped in both 1960s radicalism and her own religious upbringing.

In one rendition caught on film, she pauses halfway through the first verse to inform her audience: “I want you to know, this has absolutely nothing to do with ‘West Side Story.’ I hope I won’t have to explain it to you.”</p><p>And from her early days performing at Mr. Henry’s, a gay-friendly cabaret, Ms. Flack was also a staunch advocate of gay rights. She sang “Ballad of the Sad Young Men” on her debut album, and in performance she often introduced it as a story of young gay barflies seeking belonging.</p><p>She sang the theme song to “Making Love,” a 1982 film about a man grappling with his sexual identity. “I was so glad when that song charted,” Ms. Flack said in an <a href="https://hotspotsmagazine.com/2015/04/15/roberta-flack-comes-to-florida/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with Hotspots magazine</a>. “People who did not know that the song was about love between two men loved that song. I would talk about it in my shows, and about how love is love. Between a man and a woman, between two men, between two women. Love is universal, like music. I always say, ‘Love is a song.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Flack in 1971.

In her early childhood, the family moved to Virginia, first to Richmond and then to Arlington, a segregated suburb of Washington. Her father, Laron Flack, worked as a draftsman in the Veterans Administration; her mother, Irene (Council) Flack, was a cook at a high school who also taught music and played the organ at Arlington’s A.M.E. Zion Church.</p><p>“I grew up playing piano for the choir: Handel, Bach, Verdi, Mozart and all those great, wonderful, intricately written Negro spirituals,” Ms. Flack remembered in <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-11-20/features/9104150060_1_chart-position-music-sing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 1991 interview with The Chicago Tribune</a>. But she would also sneak down the road to the local Baptist church, savoring its rawer forms of musical worship. From time to time, she caught gospel stars like Mahalia Jackson and Sam Cooke performing there.</p><p>Ms. Flack always identified with her family’s Southern history. “I like to say that two preachers came from Black Mountain. Billy Graham and I,” she was quoted as saying in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=V9oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=les+mccann+her+voice+touched+tapped+trapped+and+kicked+every+emotion+i%27ve+ever+known&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qKkSYm-jwo&amp;sig=ACfU3U0pjt1tOtUbKXQJja1vaz1OOGFxrg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiziaLam8nhAhUItlkKHUCWCmYQ6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=les%20mccann%20her%20voice%20touched%20tapped%20trapped%20and%20kicked%20every%20emotion%20i&#39;ve%20ever%20known&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 1971 Ebony article</a>. “He’s preaching in his way and I’m preaching my way.”</p><p>Ms. Flack has no immediate survivors.<span>  </span>A seven-year marriage to the bassist Steve Novosel (which violated the law in Virginia, where interracial marriage was still illegal when she married Mr. Novosel, who is white) ended in divorce, as did a later marriage.</p><p>At 13, Ms. Flack won second place in a statewide competition for Black students after performing a Scarlatti sonata; she was convinced that she had deserved the main prize and that the judges were thrown off by the sight of a Black girl playing classical music with such command. Just two years later, she entered Howard University on a full scholarship. She became the first undergraduate vocal student to give a public recital in classical vocal literature, and she conducted a student production of “Aida” that drew a standing ovation from Howard’s music faculty.</p><p>But a dean warned that the opportunities in classical orchestras would be scarce for a Black woman, advising Ms. Flack to pursue a teaching career. Upon graduating, she started working toward a master’s degree in music education.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Flack received the 1972 Trendsetter Award from Billboard, “for moving jazz into the pop market with her soft, delicate vocal style.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gilles Petard/Redferns, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>After her father’s death, needing to support herself, she dropped out and took a job at a grade school in Farmville, N.C., where she taught English and music to children in a deeply impoverished community — an experience that left a lasting impression. “There was no piano in my classroom, but I went from room to room with a pitch pipe and autoharp, teaching them music,” she told Ebony.</p><p>After a year, she returned to Washington and began teaching at junior high schools in the city while establishing herself on the nightclub circuit. At the upscale Tivoli restaurant, Ms. Flack accompanied opera singers on piano as they promenaded across the room. During intermissions, she sometimes retired to a piano in the back room where she sang blues, folk and pop songs for the staff.</p><p>Soon came gigs under her own name at the 1520 Club and Mr. Henry’s, which was known for attracting a racially diverse clientele and for welcoming openly gay and lesbian patrons. The restaurant outfitted its upstairs specifically for Ms. Flack, with a stage and rows of pew-style seating.</p><p>She was soon the talk of D.C. “I was trying to develop my skill, to read music, interpret it, rearrange it,” she told the BBC for a documentary, “<a href="https://www.bbcselect.com/watch/roberta-flack-killing-me-softly/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Killing Me Softly: The Roberta Flack Story</a>.” “I felt I could do everything, and I felt comfortable enough to know that if I had a chance I could show anybody.”</p><p>Stars like Burt Bacharach and Johnny Mathis made a point of going to Mr. Henry’s when they were in town. One night, Liberace came and sat in, playing a piano duet with Ms. Flack. And, celebrity guests or not, what were supposed to be two- or three-set nights would often stretch on much longer. “I just couldn’t get up from the piano,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>When the star soul-jazz pianist and vocalist Les McCann heard her in 1968 at the nearby <a href="https://boundarystones.weta.org/2016/04/15/bohemian-caverns-home-dcs-jazz-crowd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bohemian Caverns</a>, he was floored. “Her voice touched, tapped, trapped and kicked over every emotion I’ve ever known,” he later wrote in <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2979209-Roberta-Flack-First-Take/image/SW1hZ2U6MTU5MTU4NjI=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the liner notes to her debut album</a>. “I laughed, cried and screamed for more.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Flack and Les McCann at Yankee Stadium in 1972.

Ms. Lieberman had sent a demo of the song to Helen Reddy, a major pop star at the time, but she was turned off by the title and the tape languished on her desk.</p><p>On the airplane, Ms. Flack jotted down the melody as she played Ms. Lieberman’s version over and over on her headphones. When she first performed it at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles, while opening for Marvin Gaye, the audience erupted at the end. Quincy Jones, who was there, counseled her to keep the song to herself until she’d recorded it.</p><p>It was released in January 1973 as a single and became ubiquitous on AM radio stations across the country.

With its feathery, electrified sound and prowling beat, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySlLq9t2qgc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">title track</a> (written by Mr. McDaniels) came to be recognized as an early example of <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/style/quiet-storm-ma0000004425/artists" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quiet storm</a>, an R&amp;B subgenre that conquered airwaves in the 1980s.</p><p>“The thing that engulfs me in music is the pulse. If I can find that heartbeat, I can live in there — in that music,” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/meet-the-beatles-again-a_b_1256439" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she told an interviewer</a> in 2012. “I think that’s the same for everyone.

Together with “Feel Like Makin’ Love,” this streak of self-produced or co-produced recordings put Ms. Flack’s talents as an arranger and bandleader on full display. (She used a pseudonym, Rubina Flake, for her production work.) “Oasis,” a later-career highlight from 1988, was also a Flack production. During these years, while battling intermittent bouts of tonsillitis, she pursued a doctorate in education at the University of Massachusetts, though she never completed it.</p><p>Ms. Flack recorded the soundtrack to the 1981 Richard Pryor film “Bustin’ Loose.” By the middle of the decade her recorded output had slowed, though she still performed often. She became a mentor to younger vocalists, including <a href="https://youtu.be/rOsZ_6NuX6g?t=608" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Luther Vandross</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t0Xo3-Ga_4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peabo Bryson</a>, both of whom sang alongside Ms. Flack before stepping straight into solo careers, largely thanks to her support.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-37"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Flack and Luther Vandross, backstage at Madison Square Garden in 1982.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ebet Roberts/Redferns, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>She frequently worked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/21/arts/music-becomes-food-for-the-hungry.html" title="">benefit concerts</a> into her touring schedule, and from 2006 to 2011 she funded and helped direct a program known as the Roberta Flack School of Music at the Hyde Leadership Charter School in the Bronx. She also served for many years as a spokesperson for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and allowed the organization to use “The First Time” royalty-free in TV commercials.</p><p>Throughout her life, Ms. Flack maintained an interest in spirituality and the occult, an orientation she credited to the influence of her grandmother, who had been a healer.</p><p>Ms. Flack was honored in 2018 with a lifetime achievement award from the Jazz Foundation of America, and two years later with a Grammy for lifetime achievement.</p><p>Into her latest years, Ms. Flack savored the memory of school-teaching days and club nights in Washington.
