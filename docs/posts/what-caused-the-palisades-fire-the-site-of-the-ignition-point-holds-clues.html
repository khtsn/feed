There are shattered pieces of electrical equipment, and a grove of madrone blackened by fire. Police tape is strung around one section of the sandy soil, now mixed with ash.</p><p>Investigators have zeroed in on these rocky bluffs with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean as the ignition point of the Palisades fire, the inferno that has destroyed at least 5,000 homes and businesses and killed at least eight people.</p><p>A recent visit by New York Times reporters to the site — near the “crime scene,” as officers for the Los Angeles Police Department who were posted nearby described it — suggested a range of possibilities, some of them contradictory, for the origin of the fire.</p><p>Charred wooden utility poles litter the ground. One plot of torched chapparal from a previous fire that firefighters thought they had extinguished on New Year’s Day, nearly a week before the Palisades fire broke out. And there is evidence of recent visitors to the area around Skull Rock, the eerily shaped boulder that draws hikers and teenage partyers whose discarded beer bottles remain in a heap of shattered glass.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For now, the answer to what caused one of Los Angeles’ most destructive firestorms may be elusive even to the investigators. The yellow crime scene tape fluttering in the wind near Skull Rock is hundreds of yards across a steep slope from the zone where a New York Times analysis of satellite images and witness photographs suggests the ignition point may have been.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="palisades-before-after" data-id="100000009923007" data-source-id="100000009923007"><div slug="palisades-before-after" data-sourceid="100000009923007" id="embed-id-100000009923007">

The slopes of sand and rock are colorless and moon-like, as if the fire had incinerated every trace of chlorophyll. It’s a far cry from before the fire, when hiking trails in the area were framed by reedy green plants and drought-tolerant bushes.</p><p>The fire tore through the steep hillsides on either side of the Temescal Ridge Trail, which runs north-south, roughly the same direction as the fierce winds that propelled the Palisades fire soon after it ignited on Tuesday, Jan. 7, just before 10:30 a.m.</p><p>An hour earlier, Ron Giller, a lawyer who lives in The Enclave, an area of Pacific Palisades near where the fire started, hiked with a friend through a patch of ground that had caught fire New Year’s Day. Residents think errant fireworks may have set that one off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The New Year’s fire was reported just after midnight and burned eight acres before fire crews got it fully contained.

What is it? I was thinking, could this thing still be active? But it seemed unlikely, you know — could there still be smoke from a fire that happened six days ago? That didn’t make sense to me.”</p><p>Some of the deadliest wildfires of the past century were blazes that firefighters believed they had extinguished, only to have the remnants flare up into an inferno. They include the <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/a-look-back-at-the-1991-oakland-hills-firestorm/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1991 firestorm in Oakland</a> that killed 25 people and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/01/us/hawaii-maui-fire-timeline.html" title="">2023 wildfire on the Hawaiian Island of Maui</a> that killed 102 people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Investigators concluded that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/lahaina-maui-fire-atf-investigation.html" title="">Maui blaze emerged from the smoldering remnants</a> of a fire near a residential area several hours earlier, perhaps from burning material that was buried under dirt until the wind uncovered it again.</p><p>Researchers have found that fires can smolder in plant roots or other organic material for days before conditions let them re-emerge.</p><p>Mr. Giller and his friend, Alan Feld, were not the only ones exploring the hills of the Palisades before the fire last week. The panoramic views from the ridge often draw hikers from the neighborhood and beyond.</p><p>During their walk that day, Mr. Feld said, they saw a few people sitting on Skull Rock.</p><p>“And one of us even said, ‘I hope they’re not smoking or anything, with these winds,’” Mr. Feld said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Video posted on social media from that morning show one group of young men near Skull Rock, dressed largely in sneakers and athletic shorts, one carrying a portable speaker. Clips posted by one member of the group begin with the men running along a trail next to a rock, with a faint cloud of smoke coming from the hillside above them. The men, still running, express alarm about smelling smoke and then seeing a fire moving quickly toward them.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yellow crime scene tape flutters in the wind near Skull Rock.

His account on X appears to have been removed. There is no indication at this point that any of the men were responsible for starting the fire; the videos do not show them smoking.</p><p>When the latest fire began to spread on Jan. 7, nearby residents watched in horror as it took hold in the parched grassland and then jumped down the hillside, stoked by rising winds. They called 911 and packed evacuation supplies in case they needed to flee. By then — around 10:30 a.m. — flames were towering over the landscape, according to photos from one resident. Just half an hour later, the fire had already sped down much of the hillside toward houses below.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-16"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="palisades-fire-origin-locator" data-id="100000009923031" data-source-id="100000009923031"><div slug="palisades-fire-origin-locator" data-sourceid="100000009923031" id="embed-id-100000009923031">

California has a long history catastrophic blazes caused by downed power lines, and early images from the other deadly fire that began last week in the Los Angeles area — the Eaton fire — show flames roaring below electrical transmission lines.</p><p>Along the trail near where the Palisades fire began, The Times found bits of power-line debris, including what appeared to be part of a lightning arrester device. But the nearest overhead power line was about a third of a mile to the north. That line, which curves down from the trail and into the neighborhood,was extensively damaged from fire, but witness photographs show it was still intact soon after the fire began.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The poles along that route have a tumultuous recent history.
