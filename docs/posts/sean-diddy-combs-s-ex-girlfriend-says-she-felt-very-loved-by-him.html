She comforted him with foot rubs and bathed him. “He was my baby,” Jane said.</p><p>The defense’s questioning sought to counter her testimony over the previous three days, in which she described taking part in what she called “hotel nights”: drug-fueled sex marathons with hired male escorts, which Jane said she did not want to engage in, and which led to problems like frequent urinary tract infections.</p><p>Under questioning from Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, Jane said she was eager to please Mr. Combs, and that she felt their hotel nights satisfied him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Do you feel that you were the only person who knew what he truly liked sexually?” Ms. Geragos asked Jane.</p><p>“Yes,” Jane responded.</p><p>Mr. Combs, the music producer and impresario also known as Puff Daddy and Diddy, is charged with sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The government has accused him of running a “criminal enterprise” whose objectives included coercing women into sex and covering it up; after Casandra Ventura, the singer known as Cassie, who testified over four days last month, Jane is the second woman put forward by prosecutors as a victim of sex trafficking.</p><p>Mr. Combs has denied the charges, and the defense’s argument that Jane and Ms. Ventura were willing participants in sex acts with Mr. Combs is a crucial part of their rebuttal to the government’s charges that the two women were coerced and sex trafficked.</p><p>At times on Tuesday, Jane offered starkly contrasting testimony about the same events she had spoken about under questioning by prosecutors.</p><p>Last week, Jane described a hotel night in Turks and Caicos, in the Caribbean, which included four rounds of sex over 24 hours with a hired escort named Paul. It left her “extremely sore” and in tears, Jane said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the cross-examination, however, the defense played an audio message that Mr. Combs sent Jane after that trip, which also included two stops in Miami; hotel nights took place at each stop. On the recording, Mr. Combs gave Jane the nickname “crack pipe.” Jane explained the name on Tuesday, saying it was because Mr. Combs was addicted “to my sex.” Smiling, Jane recalled she had “so much fun” with Mr. Combs on the trip.</p><p>Sitting with his lawyers as he listened to Jane’s testimony, Mr. Combs nodded and bounced lightly in his seat.</p><p>Ms. Geragos noted that at each of the three stops on that trip, “entertainers” — Jane and Mr. Combs’s term for hired escorts for their sexual encounters — were present. “Unfortunately, yes,” Jane said.</p><p>On the stand Tuesday, Jane said there was an “expectation” in their relationship that she would participate in hotel nights and help set them up: “I picked up on that fairly quickly, and I would make these arrangements because the undertone was an expectation.”</p><p>Asked if she ultimately wanted to break up with Mr. Combs, Jane replied, “Of course not.”</p><p>She said that from the start of their relationship, Mr. Combs was upfront about seeing other women, describing himself as “polyamorous.”</p><p>One romantic rival that caused friction in Jane’s relationship with Mr. Combs was Caresha Brownlee, a rapper known as Yung Miami. While Jane’s time with Mr. Combs was private, she said, his relationship with Ms. Brownlee was public and widely documented on social media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“That was hard to watch,” Jane said, adding that she felt there was an “imbalance” in how much more attention Mr. Combs gave Ms. Brownlee.</p><p>Jane has recounted vivid details of a troubled relationship with Mr. Combs, which began in 2021 and continued until shortly before Mr. Combs’s arrest in September 2024.</p><p>Under questioning from prosecutors, Jane said she was pressured to have sex with a succession of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-jane.html" title="">male escorts without condoms</a>, and developed painful infections as a result. She once threw up in the bathroom of a luxury hotel after having sex with two men, she testified; after Mr. Combs told her “let’s go” because a third man was waiting to have sex with her, she complied.</p><p>Jane was also part of Mr. Combs’s life during the critical period after Ms. Ventura <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">filed her bombshell lawsuit</a> in November 2023, in which Ms. Ventura described being coerced into drug-fueled sex marathons she called “freak-offs.” Recognizing a similar pattern to what she called “hotel nights” or “debauchery,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-jane-hotel-nights.html" title="">Jane texted Mr. Combs</a> three days after that suit was filed: “I feel like I’m reading my own sexual trauma. It makes me sick how three solid pages, word for word, is exactly my experiences and my anguish.”</p><p>She was also staying at Mr. Combs’s Miami-area mansion in May 2024 when CNN broadcast a leaked hotel security video <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video.html" title="">showing Mr. Combs assaulting Ms. Ventura</a>, and witnessed the mogul and his team <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video-response.html" title="">preparing an apologetic response</a>.</p><p>Even while testifying against him, Jane retains strong ties to Mr. Combs. He is paying her legal expenses as well as the $10,000-a-month rent on her home in Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At the start of her testimony on Tuesday, Jane was asked by Ms. Geragos whether Mr. Combs has ever attempted to interfere with her attorney’s representation of her.</p><p>“No,” Jane answered.</p><p>Olivia Bensimon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
