Ms. Cohen had been chief counsel to the acting U.S. attorney, Matthew Podolsky, while Mr. Rohrbach had worked as a co-chief of the general crimes unit.</p><p>Two of the people said the Justice Department in Washington had acted without any warning on Friday and that Ms. Cohen and Mr. Rohrbach were immediately escorted out of the Lower Manhattan building that houses the U.S. attorney’s office.</p><p>A spokesman for the office declined to comment, and a spokesman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The development was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-prosecutors-investigated-eric-adams-put-leave-justice/story?id=119565695" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported</a> by ABC News.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The action came less than a month after Justice Department officials in Washington ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan to ask a judge to dismiss the case against Mr. Adams, leading to the resignations of at least eight prosecutors and supervisors in New York and Washington, including the government’s lead lawyer on the case. Another prosecutor who worked on the case, Derek Wikstrom, was placed on administrative leave at the time.</p><p>Prosecutors in Washington last month asked a Manhattan federal judge to dismiss the case, saying that it was hampering Mr. Adams’s cooperation with the White House’s immigration agenda. That motion is still pending.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonah E.
