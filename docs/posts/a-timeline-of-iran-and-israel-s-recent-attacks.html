Residents of Tehran reported hearing multiple explosions in and around the Iranian capital.</p><p>The attacks renewed fears of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/israel-iran.html" title="">a wider war in the Middle East</a> as Israel’s offensive against Hamas in Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-guerrilla.html" title="">stretches into a second year</a>, and as it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">fights a ground war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon</a>.</p><p>Here is a recent history of the conflict, which has often involved Iran’s network of allies in Lebanon, Iraq and other countries:</p><h2 id="link-ba58">2019</h2><h3 id="link-7dc918e0"><span>Strikes against Iran’s allies</span></h3><p>Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/world/middleeast/israel-iran-shadow-war.html" title="">carried out a series of attacks</a> in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq to prevent Iran from equipping its Arab allies with precision-guided missiles, drones and other sophisticated weapons.</p><h2 id="link-ba6f">2021</h2><h3 id="link-2f00edd9"><span>An attack on an oil tanker</span></h3><p>In July, an oil tanker managed by an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/world/middleeast/tanker-attack-oman.html" title="">Israeli-owned shipping firm</a> was attacked off the coast of Oman, killing two crew members, according to the company and three Israeli officials. Two of the officials said that the attack appeared to have been carried out by Iranian drones.</p><h3 id="link-3a3f8bc"><span>A remote-controlled assassination</span></h3><p>In November, Israel killed Iran’s top nuclear scientist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fakhrizadeh-assassination-israel.html" title="">Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, with a remote-controlled machine gun</a>. The assassination was part of its campaign to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities through sabotage and cyberattacks.</p><h2 id="link-ba70">2022</h2><h3 id="link-a3bfe9f"><span>A motorcycle assassination</span></h3><p>In May, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/22/world/asia/iran-revolutionary-guard-killed.html" title="">two assassins on motorcycles shot and killed Col. Sayad Khodayee</a>, an officer in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iran blamed Israel and vowed revenge.</p><p>As in other such cases, Israel made no public comment on the killing, but it told the United States it had targeted the officer. Israeli officials said Colonel Khodayee was the deputy commander of a unit that planned and carried out covert operations around the world, including assassinations and abductions.</p><h3 id="link-358bf4ff"><span>Iranians are poisoned</span></h3><p>In May, two Iranian scientists suddenly fell ill and died within days of each other, in cities hundreds of miles apart.</p><p>Ayoub Entezari, an aeronautical engineer at a military research facility, and the geologist Kamran Aghamolaei both developed symptoms of food poisoning before their conditions rapidly deteriorated. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/world/middleeast/israel-poison-iranian-scientists.html" title="">Iran believed Israel had poisoned their food</a>, according to an Iranian official. Israel had no comment.</p><h2 id="link-ba71">2023</h2><h3 id="link-4e02ef17"><span>The Oct. 7 attacks</span></h3><p>After the start of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault, militias backed by Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/world/middleeast/iran-syria-strike-proxies.html" title="">stepped up their own attacks</a>.</p><h3 id="link-1b787251"><span>An airstrike in Syria</span></h3><p>In December, Iran accused Israel of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/26/world/middleeast/iran-military-official-israel-syria.html" title="">killing a high-level Iranian officer</a> in a missile strike in Syria.</p><h2 id="link-ba72">2024</h2><h3 id="link-2e81d47"><span>A strike on Damascus, and several rounds of retaliation</span></h3><p>In April, an airstrike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers. Iran blamed Israel and vowed to hit back forcefully.</p><p>Two weeks later, Tehran launched a barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/world/middleeast/iran-israel-attack.html?searchResultPosition=26" title="">unexpectedly large-scale attack</a>, although nearly all the weapons were shot down by Israel and its allies.</p><p>The next week, Israel launched a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran.html" title="">strike on an antiaircraft system</a> near the central Iranian city of Isfahan that protects a nuclear facility.</p><h3 id="link-55c38911"><span>An assassination in Tehran</span></h3><p>In July, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran when a bomb was smuggled into a guesthouse run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, where he was staying. Iranian officials and Hamas blamed Israel for the assassination, an assessment also reached by several U.S. officials who requested anonymity. Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility.</p><h3 id="link-8421b2b"><span>A pager attack and Nasrallah’s death</span></h3><p>In September, Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amini, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-ambassador-mojtaba-amini-pager-attack.html" title="">injured in a massive pager attack</a> that targeted Hezbollah members, killing at least 11 people and wounding thousands. Mr. Amini lost an eye when a pager he was carrying exploded in a simultaneous wave of blasts targeting wireless electronic devices. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the blasts.</p><p>Days later, Israel killed the Hezbollah leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">Hassan Nasrallah</a> in massive airstrikes south of Beirut.</p><h3 id="link-d04ec7e"><span>Iran fires missiles at Israel</span></h3><p>Iran in October <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/world/middleeast/iran-ballistic-missiles-israel-assassinations.html" title="">fired about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel</a>, most of which were intercepted by Israeli and U.S. air defense systems. Iran said the attacks were in retaliation for Israel’s assassinations of Mr. Nasrallah, Mr. Haniyeh and an Iranian commander. The strikes were seen as an escalation because Tehran opted to use more sophisticated weapons than it did in the April attack.</p><h3 id="link-33402324"><span>Hamas leader killed</span></h3><p>Later in October, Israeli forces came upon Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-dead.html" title="">killed him in a firefight</a>. The Biden administration hoped his death could rekindle cease-fire talks, but officials in Qatar, a mediator in the negotiations, said they had seen no sign the group had softened its negotiating position in the days after he was killed.</p><p>Qasim Nauman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Other War</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The small number of Gazan cancer patients receiving care in Jordan’s capital, Amman<strong>,</strong> have escaped a war zone, but in many ways, the fight for life is just beginning. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/gaza-war-cancer-jordan.html">Now their battle is against cancer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli Strike Kills 3 Journalists:</strong><strong> </strong>The journalists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/israel-strike-lebanon-journalists.html">worked for Lebanese news organizations</a>, their employers said.
