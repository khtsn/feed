Errol Langton, the patriarch of the white South African family, had spent much of his time so far with a pen in hand, signing required documents at a refugee coordinating office.</p><p>His granddaughter played with toy blocks on the floor. His oldest son watched over her. They had just eaten noodles. Later, they would spend time looking for apartments.</p><p>“Everybody still doesn’t believe that we’re actually standing here,” Mr. Langton, 48, said in an interview, about 40 hours after landing at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. His family was among the first group of 59 South Africans who arrived in the United States this week, about three months after President Trump signed an executive order <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/afrikaner-refugees-trump-south-africa.html" title="">establishing refugee status</a> for Afrikaners, the white ethnic minority that ruled during apartheid.</p><p>The president essentially halted all refugee admission programs on his first day in office. But he soon created an expedited pathway for Afrikaners, who claim they have been discriminated against and subjected to violence because of their race, or have reason to believe they will be.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now, the Langton family has traded its South African hometown on the beach, Hibberdene, for a southern American city thousands of miles away. But Mr. Langton said he felt much safer already, as did his extended family who had joined him: his wife, son, three daughters, son-in-law and two grandchildren.</p><p>Mr. Langton has a brother in Birmingham. But he said another factor had also drawn his family to the state.</p><p>“South Africa is a very warm country, and Alabama is very much the same,” he said, seeking shade on a humid, hot afternoon outside the refugee office.</p><p>Since arriving in the United States on May 12, few Afrikaners have publicly spoken about leaving their country, their first impressions of America or what they make of the charged debate over their status as refugees. (While waiting at the airport in Johannesburg, the Afrikaners passengers said the U.S. embassy had instructed them not to speak with the news media.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Afrikaners at an airport in Johannesburg before their flight to the United States.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ilan Godfrey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Republicans have welcomed them. Before leaving for a trip to the Middle East, Mr. Trump told reporters: “White farmers are being brutally killed, and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.” He added that the United States had “essentially extended citizenship” to the group of Afrikaners because he said they were victims of a genocide.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>South African police data <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/white-south-africans-refugees.html" title="">does not support the narrative of mass murder</a> of white South Africans. And Mr. Trump’s focus on Afrikaners has brought just as much attention to the tens of thousands of people whom his administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/trump-refugees-white-south-africa-aghanistan.html" title="">has decided to keep out</a>, including Afghans who helped U.S. soldiers during the war in Afghanistan.</p><p>In an hourlong interview with The New York Times, Mr. Langton said he had been trying to leave South Africa for 10 years and was grateful to President Trump. He said he had been threatened back home because he was “a white guy and a farmer,” and that his business had suffered financially because of the hatred directed at Afrikaners.</p><p>Mr. Langton also said South African government inspectors who visited his farm years ago had physically threatened him after demanding money. He described the threats as racially motivated.</p><p>“South Africa is a beautiful country, and it breaks my heart that we’ve left,” he said. “And the majority of the people — Black, white, you name it, across all cultural divides — are brilliant, friendly people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The problem, he added, was that “white farmers are generally attacked with cause.”</p><p>From April 2020 to March 2024, 225 people were killed on farms in South Africa, according to the South African police. Almost half of the victims — 101 — were current or former workers living on farms, who are mostly Black. Fifty-three of the victims were farmers, who are usually white.</p><p>Mr. Langton pointed at his family when asked why he had been so eager to be among the first to leave. “Those are the people that I did it for,” he said.</p><p>On Wednesday, the family was at the offices of Inspiritus, a nonprofit resettlement agency that assists refugees in Alabama. The organization said in a statement that it was “mandated to serve all refugees regardless of how they arrive.”</p><p>“It is our hope that opening refugee resettlement to Afrikaners means a move toward helping the over 20,000 vulnerable people who remain stranded — families and individuals from places like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Syria — who have fled violence, war and persecution and have completed the rigorous U.S. vetting process,” the agency said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of President Trump outside the U.S. embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joao Silva/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Langton said he was in a group chat with the other Afrikaners who landed in the United States this week.</p><p>“Some people are lucky enough to have worked here before, and others have family out here,” he said. “Unfortunately, some people are coming in completely alone. It’s a daunting experience.”</p><p>Asked what he thought of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/africa/ramaphosa-south-africa-refugees-coward-white-trump.html" title="">criticism</a> that he and his fellow Afrikaners had received, Mr. Langton said that “haters are going to hate,” and that it was terrible “to be labeled as traitors and sellouts.”</p><p>He praised Mr. Trump for his crackdown on illegal immigration and said that he should not be criticized for focusing on white Afrikaners because, Mr. Langton argued, every president throughout history has “prioritized different groups” of refugees.</p><p>In 2020, the final full year of Mr. Trump’s first term, under a drastically reduced refugee cap, the United States admitted about 11,000 refugees, a record low. Then President Joseph R. Biden Jr. revived the program. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, about 100,000 refugees arrived to the country, the largest tally in nearly three decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>This new chapter, Mr. Langton said, felt “very much surreal.” Though he emphasized that his family was already growing fond of Alabama and getting a feel for its football-obsessed culture. (They have not yet picked a college team to support.)</p><p>“Driving on the other side of the highway, on the other side of the road, is the only thing that’s kind of really cementing it,” Mr. Langton said. Eager to remain a farmer, he had considered moving to Montana because of its rural, mountainous landscape. But his family hated the cold, so Alabama it was.</p><p>In South Africa, Mr. Langton grew spinach, mustard, Swiss chard and sweet potatoes. Now, he said he would most likely work an IT job in Birmingham. But eventually he hopes to purchase a plot of land where his family can farm, raise chickens and perhaps run a commercial operation.</p><p>Inside the local headquarters for Inspiritus, there was another batch of offices occupied by the Hispanic and Immigrant Center of Alabama, a group that helps Hispanic migrants. Several of the people inside were immigrants from Venezuela, who said they felt hurt by America’s embrace of other refugees, and the apparent disdain for Latin Americans.</p><p>Outside, Mr. Langton was organizing his family to finally leave the refugee office.</p><p>Asked what his party affiliation would be if he became a U.S. citizen, Mr. Langton said: “I think Democrats have lost their minds. So Republican, unless there’s a reason for me to change.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Like many of his new neighbors in the deeply conservative state, would he soon purchase a piece of Trump memorabilia?</p><p>“It’s too early to know if I’ll put a Trump sticker on the back of a car I don’t own yet,” he said.</p><p>Zimasa Matiwane<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.
