</span> in a 13-7 fashion on Ascent.</p>



<p>While G2 maintained their roster which had found them qualifying consistently for international events, including Champions 2024, KC were coming in with an almost complete roster rebuild, with only <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/10307/marteen">
		marteen	</a>
</span> left from the 2024 VCT season. Both teams had an almost-mirror comp, with the sole difference being Omen on G2&#39;s side while KC opted for the Astra.</p>

<p>G2 started off strong with a pistol round win, and a failed force-buy attempt in round two ensured they got to a 3-0 start. KC were able to convert their full-buy round with <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/727/saadhak">
		saadhak	</a>
</span> winning a 1v1 against <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span>. Another G2 round win saw KC once again pushed into an eco which G2 won, pushing their lead to 5-1. KC won the upcoming buy with three left alive, and post a timeout, they regained their footing to tie things up at 5-5. G2 won the last two rounds were to close out the half 7-5 with a 1V3 sheriff clutch from Trent. Despite the close score, both <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span> and Trent had 15+ kills already while none on KC had crossed six.</p>


<p><em>Trent with the 1v3 sheriff clutch.</em></p>

<p>The second half saw G2 on attack. They won five straight rounds in a row as Trent found two 3Ks and Jawgemo a 3K and 4K, continuing their blistering pace from the first half. It seemed over at 12-5, but KC still had some fight in them, with them winning a 2V5 and then Marteen clutching a 1v1 against Jawgemo. G2 closed out the next round to lock in their win 13-7. </p>

<p>Jawgemo was the MVP with 27 kills on Neon – equal to the top two players on KC put together –  and a kill differential of +20. Trent was close behind with 24 frags of his own. In contrast, all of KC went negative in terms of kill differential and their top frag – Marteen – had 14 kills to his name. </p>

<p>“Our loss against FUT yesterday refreshed us as a team, it made us focus and figure out what our goals are.” said Jawgemo. The G2 duelist also casually dropped a bomb with him mentioning he always changes his settings before every event, while also calling his 347 ACS performance today “shaky.”</p>



<p>FUT came into the main stage through the international play-ins without losing a game, while T1 won the APAC play-ins to qualify. FUT had benched <span data-ref-id="8">

</span>, fielding <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/12793/xeus">

	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4056/sylvan">

</span> joining, as well as ex-DRX player <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> joining the team, keeping only <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29833/izu">
		iZu	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/485/stax">
		stax	</a>
</span> from 2024&#39;s VCT season. </p>

<p>Ascent was the chosen map of play, with T1 starting on attack. FUT were able to win the pistol and anti-eco, with T1 converting their full-buy and the following round with 3Ks from Meteor and Sylvan respectively. FUT bounced back with a retake of their own but an ace from Meteor tied things up at 3-3 again. The half continued in a back and forth fashion, concluding 6-6.</p>


<p><em>Meteor is clean in the clutch.</em></p>

<p>With the side-swap though, T1 looked like they could do no wrong. They won six rounds in a row, the last with a 4K from Stax to reach match point. FUT finally got on the board for the first time in the half with <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/6510/atakaptan">
		AtaKaptan	</a>
</span> winning a 1v1 to bring the score to 12-7, but T1 won the next round to take the map 13-7.</p>

<p>T1&#39;s Meteor had an absolutely ballistic game on the Killjoy, going +13 in terms of kill differential and a 311 ACS. For FUT&#39;s side, Atakaptan was the MVP with 19 frags and an ACS of 265.</p>

<p>Both T1 and G2 only need one more win to qualify for the playoffs. </p>
