While other countries in Latin America have raised concerns about Mr. Trump’s sweeping deportation plans, Colombia appears to be among the first to explicitly refuse to cooperate.</p><p>“I cannot make migrants stay in a country that does not want them,” Mr. Petro wrote, “but if that country sends them back, it should be with dignity and respect for them and for our country.”</p><p>He said he was still open to receiving deportees on nonmilitary flights.</p><p>Mr. Petro’s stance put him on a collision course with Mr. Trump, who since taking office last Monday has issued a series of executive orders and made other moves aimed at laying the groundwork to try to deport an enormous number of migrants.</p><p>The tariffs alone could deal a significant blow to Colombia’s economy. The United States is Colombia’s largest trading partner, with top Colombian exports including crude oil, coffee and cut flowers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Petro also cast attention on Americans living in Colombia. In a social media <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1883558923573067937" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, Mr. Petro said that more than 15,000 Americans were living in the country without authorization, and called upon them to “regularize” their immigration status.</p><p>The U.S. Embassy in Bogotá did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Petro did not include details about when or how many military planes and migrants had been turned away.</p><p>There were 190,000 unauthorized Colombian immigrants living in the U.S. in 2022, according to the most recent data available from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pew Research Center.</a></p><p>A representative for Mr. Petro confirmed that the planes had been turned away, but did not immediately respond to other questions. Representatives for Colombia’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The United States typically sends back deportees in planes resembling commercial jets that are operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. After Mr. Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order to allow the military to assist in securing the border</a>, the acting secretary of defense, Robert G. Salesses, said in a statement last week that the military would provide airplanes to support with deportation flights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Trump administration is sending the military planes in addition to the usual flights operated by ICE, meaning that they do not replace the typical flights that land several times a week in countries throughout the region, and which Mr. Petro referred to as “civilian flights.”</p><p>The new planes sent by the military can only depart from the United States if the receiving nation has approved them. Mr. Salesses said that before the military sent flights, the State Department would first “obtain the requisite diplomatic clearances and provide host-nation notification.”</p><p>It is unclear which countries may have agreed to receive military planes carrying deportees, or if Colombia had agreed — and then revoked its agreement.</p><p>Early on Friday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/trump-us-guatemala-military-migrants.html" title="">Guatemala received two U.S. Air Force</a> jets carrying around 160 deportees in total, making it one of the first countries to publicly receive such flights. The Guatemalan government sent the country’s vice president to oversee the arrival of the deportees on the C-17 aircraft and the Trump administration hailed that effort in messages on social media.</p><p>Officials in Mexico, the source of the largest number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, have said they remained open to receiving deported citizens and routine deportations have taken place to Mexican cities along the U.S. border in recent days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“When it comes to repatriations, we will always welcome Mexican men and women back to our territory with open arms,” Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a <a href="https://x.com/SRE_mx/status/1882987545161617520" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on social media on Friday night.</p><p>Still, Mexican authorities have not disclosed whether they plan to accept military flights or whether they will receive deported migrants from other countries, as Mexico has sometimes done in the past.</p><p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-refuses-us-military-flight-deporting-migrants-sources-say-2025-01-25/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news outlets reported</a> that Mexico had turned away a military plane carrying deportees, an account that could not be independently confirmed. </p><p>Honduras, which like Colombia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/honduras-china-trump-deportation.html" title="">has pushed back against</a> the Trump administration’s plans for mass deportations, has said it is open to receiving military flights.</p><p>The foreign minister, Enrique Reina, said in an interview on Saturday that it was “open to receiving our compatriots as long as the conditions are appropriate and have been properly coordinated.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He said that the government had been in conversation with the U.S. Embassy in Honduras about deportation flights but it had not formally been asked to authorize the arrival of military planes carrying deportees.</p><p>About four million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico live in the United States, representing about 37 percent of the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the Pew Research Center.</p><p>But while Mexico is still the most common country of birth for unauthorized immigrants in the United States, that number is down from a peak of 6.9 million 2007.</p><p>The unauthorized immigrant population from other countries has grown in recent years, especially from the Caribbean, South America and Asia.</p><p>Annie Correal<!-- --> contributed reporting from Mexico City.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Simon Romero is a Times correspondent covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
