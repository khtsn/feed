While other countries in Latin America have raised concerns about Mr. Trump’s sweeping deportation plans, Colombia appears to be among the first to explicitly refuse to cooperate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A flight from Virginia arrived in Guatemala City on Jan. 15 carrying 135 deported migrants.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniele Volpe for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I cannot make migrants stay in a country that does not want them,” Mr. Petro wrote, “but if that country sends them back, it should be with dignity and respect for them and for our country.” He said he was still open to receiving deportees on nonmilitary flights. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a <a href="https://www.state.gov/ending-illegal-immigration-in-the-united-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. </p><p>A representative for Mr. Petro confirmed that the planes had been turned away, but did not immediately respond to other questions. Representatives for Colombia’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>President Petro’s remarks came in response to a post about the treatment of Brazilian deportees. Brazil’s foreign ministry complained of “<a href="https://x.com/ItamaratyGovBr/status/1883313955495645540" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">degrading treatment</a>” of its citizens after 88 migrants arrived in the country handcuffed on Friday and some complained of mistreatment after not being given water or allowed to use the bathroom during the flight.</p><p>Mr. Petro’s stance put him on a collision course with Mr. Trump, who since taking office last Monday has issued a series of executive orders and made other moves aimed at laying the groundwork to try to deport an enormous number of migrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In his missives on social media, Mr. Trump called Mr. Petro, a former left-wing guerrilla, a “socialist,” a term which Mr. Petro has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gustavopetrourrego/posts/943384344271623/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no problem in using</a> to describe himself, and contended that Mr. Petro was “very unpopular.” Mr. Petro’s approval ratings stand at around 34 percent, weighed down by corruption scandals and a resurgence in fighting among armed groups. </p><p>To justify his measures targeting Colombia, Mr. Trump also claimed that the military deportation flights refused by Mr. Petro included a “large number of Illegal Criminals” and that the United States was seeking the “return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.”</p><p>The tariffs alone could deal a significant blow to Colombia’s economy. The United States is Colombia’s largest trading partner, with top Colombian exports to the American market including crude oil, coffee and cut flowers.</p><p>Mr. Petro also cast attention on Americans living in Colombia. In a social media <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1883558923573067937" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, Mr. Petro said that more than 15,000 Americans were living in the country without authorization, and called upon them to “regularize” their immigration status.</p><p>The U.S. Embassy in Bogotá did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.S. Embassy in Bogotá, Colombia’s capital.

While Mr. Petro has criticized the United States more than past presidents, he continued to collaborate with the United States and regularly accepted deportation flights, said Colombian political analyst Sergio Guzmán. </p><p>This is what “makes this new approach so surprising,” he added.</p><p>The United States typically sends back deportees in planes resembling commercial jets that are operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. </p><p>After Mr. Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order to allow the military to assist in securing the border</a>, the acting secretary of defense, Robert G. Salesses, said in a statement last week that the military would provide airplanes to support with deportation flights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Trump administration is sending the military planes in addition to the usual flights operated by ICE, meaning that they do not replace the typical flights that land several times a week in countries throughout the region, and which Mr. Petro referred to as “civilian flights.”</p><p>The new planes sent by the military can only depart from the United States if the receiving nation has approved them. Mr. Salesses said that before the military sent flights, the State Department would first “obtain the requisite diplomatic clearances and provide host-nation notification.” He said the flights would transport people in U.S. Border Patrol custody.</p><p>It is unclear which countries may have agreed to receive military planes carrying deportees, or if Colombia had agreed — and then revoked its agreement.</p><p>Early on Friday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/trump-us-guatemala-military-migrants.html" title="">Guatemala received two U.S. Air Force</a> jets carrying around 160 deportees in total, making it one of the first countries to publicly receive such flights. The Guatemalan government sent the country’s vice president to oversee the arrival of the deportees on the C-17 aircraft and the Trump administration hailed that effort in messages on social media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>This photo released by the Guatemalan Migration Institute shows Guatemalans who had been deported from the United States   descending from a U.S. military aircraft on Friday in Guatemala City.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Officials in Mexico, the source of the largest number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, have said they remained open to receiving deported citizens and routine deportations have taken place to Mexican cities along the U.S. border in recent days.</p><p>“When it comes to repatriations, we will always welcome Mexican men and women back to our territory with open arms,” Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a <a href="https://x.com/SRE_mx/status/1882987545161617520" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on social media on Friday night.</p><p>Still, Mexican authorities have not disclosed whether they plan to accept military flights or whether they will receive deported migrants from other countries, as Mexico has sometimes done in the past.</p><p>On Friday, NBC reported that Mexico had refused to authorize a military plane carrying deportees from the United States, an account that could not be independently confirmed. </p><p>Honduras, which like Colombia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/honduras-china-trump-deportation.html" title="">has pushed back against</a> the Trump administration’s plans for mass deportations, has said it is open to receiving military flights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Honduran foreign minister, Enrique Reina, said in an interview on Saturday that his government was “open to receiving our compatriots as long as the conditions are appropriate and have been properly coordinated.”</p><p>He said that the government had been in conversation with the U.S. Embassy in Honduras about deportation flights but it had not formally been asked to authorize the arrival of military planes carrying deportees.</p><p>Jack Nicas<!-- --> contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Simon Romero is a Times correspondent covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
