This month, he announced sweeping changes to reduce Meta’s restrictions on speech, ended a fact-checking program and killed diversity efforts in the workplace. He also showed up to President Trump’s inauguration and has criticized former President Biden’s administration for being anti-tech.</p><p>At Meta, Mr. Zuckerberg has clamped down on employee dissent in recent years, including by banning workplace discussions around certain contentious social and political issues. Some employees have pushed back on the changes, such as the removal of tampons from the men’s bathrooms at the company, which were provided for transgender and nonbinary employees. As recently as Thursday, some employees were circulating a sign-up form for workers to purchase sanitary products and bring them to Meta’s offices in an act of protest, said two people who have seen the form.</p><p>A spokesman for Meta declined to comment. 404 Media previously <a href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-says-everything-i-say-leaks-in-leaked-meeting-audio/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on parts of Mr. Zuckerberg’s conversation.</p><p>This is a developing news story.
