This month, Mr. Zuckerberg announced sweeping changes to reduce Meta’s restrictions on speech, ended a fact-checking program and killed diversity efforts in the workplace. He also showed up to President Trump’s inauguration and has criticized former President Biden’s administration for being anti-tech.</p><p>At Meta, Mr. Zuckerberg has clamped down on employee dissent in recent years, including by banning workplace discussions around certain contentious social and political issues. </p><p>Some employees have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/tampons-silicon-valley-workers-protest.html" title="">pushed back on the changes</a>, such as the removal of tampons from the men’s bathrooms at the company, which were provided for transgender and nonbinary employees. As recently as Thursday, some employees were circulating a sign-up form for workers to purchase sanitary products and bring them to Meta’s offices in an act of protest, said two people who have seen the form.</p><p>A spokesman for Meta declined to comment. Business Insider previously <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-employees-intense-year-2025-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on parts of Mr. Zuckerberg’s conversation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During the meeting, Mr. Zuckerberg said some of Meta’s changes — such as eliminating many of its D.E.I. teams — was a reflection of the times. </p><p>“We’re in the middle of a pretty rapidly changing policy and regulatory landscape that views any policy that might advantage any one group of people over another as something that is unlawful,” he said. “Because of that, we and every other institution out there are going to need to adjust.”</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg said he personally believed Meta had a “good track record” on diversity and that having a diverse work force was a strength.</p><p>Janelle Gale, Meta’s head of people, said at the meeting that there were other types of discrimination that were not as widely recognized at Meta but still needed to be addressed. The company has fired women for sexual harassment, she said, and some people had been excluded for their political views.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg said Meta was bringing back a form of its unconscious bias training that would not just focus on “a few different groups.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some employees were upset that the meeting’s format had changed. For years, employees voted on which questions to ask Mr. Zuckerberg. Those that received the most votes were asked. </p><p>This time, that did not happen. A side chat room where employees used to be able to comment on the live presentation was also removed, two people who attended the call said.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg said the meeting changes were intentional because of an increasing number of leaks in recent years. </p><p>“I think there are a bunch of things that are value destroying that I’m not going to talk about,” he said, referring to the types of questions that have become public. “Maybe it’s the nature of running a company of this scale. But it’s a little bit of a bummer.”</p><p>After the meeting, Meta sent an internal message saying that employees would be terminated if they talked to the media, two people who received the memo said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>During the call, Mr. Zuckerberg also noted the uncertainty around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/technology/tiktok-ban.html" title="">TikTok</a>, the Chinese-owned video app that has been banned in the United States under a federal law that took effect this month. President Trump has signed an executive order to pause the ban.</p><p>TikTok was one of Meta’s “main competitors,” Mr. Zuckerberg said, adding that he was watching developments closely. </p><p>Employees asked Mr. Zuckerberg about whether the emergence of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/technology/what-is-deepseek-china-ai.html" title="">DeepSeek</a>, a Chinese A.I. start-up that produced an advanced A.I. model for a fraction of the cost of many other companies, raised questions about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/technology/meta-data-center.html" title="">Meta’s rising spending on data centers</a>.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg said DeepSeek would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/meta-deepseek-ai-open-source.html" title="">help Meta’s open-source strategy</a> around A.I., which includes freely sharing code so that other companies can build apps and keep improving the technology. Some of DeepSeek’s technological advancements have already helped improve Meta’s A.I. models, he said.</p><p>But spending on data centers — which provides computing power for A.I. advances — would still be a competitive advantage for Meta, Mr. Zuckerberg said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“This year feels a little more like a sprint to me,” he said.<span>  </span>“It’s going to be a crazy year.”</p><p>Kate Conger<!-- --> and <!-- -->Sheera Frenkel<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent for The Times based in San Francisco.
