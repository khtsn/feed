    <h1>These Students Ousted Bangladesh’s Government. Now They’re Rebuilding a Democracy.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>On a recent evening, in a brand-new office on the first floor of a commercial building where wires dangled from the ceiling and new flooring was still being laid, a group of university students were plotting a new future for Bangladesh.</p><p>A few months earlier, they were among the thousands who had risen up and overthrown Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year rule had descended into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/02/world/asia/bangladesh-democracy-election.html" title="">authoritarianism</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/asia/bangladesh-disappeared.html" title="">brutality</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/bangladesh-banks.html" title="">corruption</a>.</p><p>Now, the students are determined to seize their opening — however long it may last or however messy the process may be — to rebuild Bangladesh as a robust democracy. They envision a system with free and fair elections, social justice and bulwarks against autocracy that no leader could chip away.</p><p>“Our political power is in a very fluid form right now,” said Arif Sohel, 26, a student organizer. He said he hoped to unite students and win over political parties with a pithy message: “We want a country that is stable and will progress.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is a daunting task for Bangladesh, a nation born in violence 53 years ago and turbulent ever since. The work has fallen to an unusual mix of unelected people in the interim government — highly trained experts with long, distinguished careers and students just embarking on theirs — who are operating under enormous pressures beyond the weight of history.</p><p>A major political party that had been suppressed under Ms. Hasina is demanding that fresh elections be held, perhaps within months, before any reforms are formalized. Weary citizens continue to suffer under high inflation, which has pushed up prices for essentials like oil and rice. Protests keep disrupting life in Dhaka, the capital. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/asia/india-bangladesh-tensions.html" title="">Tensions with neighboring India</a> have soared amid reports of attacks by Muslims on Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. There are fears of a resurgence of militant Islam.</p><p>While toppling the old system was swift, overhauling it will take time — and the students and the technocrats now in charge may not have that luxury.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A group of young men gathered at a long table in an office." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/multimedia/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj/00bangladesh-transition-02-ghfj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/01bf0217-c176-5a9b-978a-4b26823160a1" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of an umbrella group called Students Against Discrimination.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mahfuj Alam, 26, the main student adviser to Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who leads the interim government.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“It’s moving, it’s moving, it’s moving,” Mahfuj Alam, the main student adviser to Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who leads the interim government, said of the progress it had made.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It was stagnant before for two months,” Mr. Alam said, referring to the period after Ms. Hasina’s overthrow on Aug. 5, when the government was solely focused on law and order. “And right now it’s moving, and our economy is healing.”</p><p>Mr. Alam, 26, takes credit for being the strategist whose lofty ideals drove the protests. “The idea of abolition of a fascist regime and the idea of a ‘new political settlement’ was my wording,” he said. In a country with a conservative Muslim society, the students have leaned into the language of left-wing revolutionary politics.</p><p>For now, Mr. Alam said, the new government is focusing on more visible, short-term reforms like updating election rules. More deep-rooted changes, such as increasing women’s participation in government and creating new jobs for Bangladesh’s young population — nearly 80 percent of its 171 million people are of working age — will take longer.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Yunus, an 84-year-old microfinance pioneer, said his government had the full support of the people. While he has faced criticism for being too slow with reforms, “they didn’t say ‘We don’t want you,’” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It might take several years, but the students will be able to pull off what they call “Bangladesh 2.0,” Mr. Yunus said.</p><h2 id="link-ba2ba09">A ‘Moral Responsibility’</h2><p>Badiul Alam Majumdar, a 78-year-old Bangladeshi economist, activist and election expert, first heard that he would be overseeing the reform of his country’s electoral system a few minutes before Mr. Yunus went on national television to announce his appointment.</p><p>It was a similar experience for Ali Riaz, a political scientist at Illinois State University, who is in charge of the Constitution reform commission.</p><p>Their panels are among six that Mr. Yunus set up in September. They are filled mostly with experts from academia, government and civil society groups, as well as student representatives, and are excluding political parties from their initial work. The commissions have until the end of December to come up with recommendations on overhauling institutions such as the police and the judiciary, as well as on reducing corruption and improving public administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Yunus has said that elections could take place by the end of 2025.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The interim government at first focused on restoring law and order after Ms. Hasina’s ouster.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The interim government wants to lay down big ideas, then let elected representatives decide on the details. It expects broad reforms to be enacted, given support for sweeping change from the public and the politicians who are likely to lead the next government.</p><p>Mr. Majumdar’s commission is considering measures that would allow the Bangladeshi diaspora to vote, increase turnout among female voters and update electoral rolls.</p><p>Bangladeshis haven’t hesitated to weigh in, writing hundreds of emails saying that anyone running for office must meet certain educational thresholds.</p><p>“They feel that they will be better able to understand the things that are needed to run an organization or office,” Mr. Majumdar said. “But I keep telling people that all the people who are most corrupt and the bad dudes are very highly educated.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Across town, Iftekhar Zaman, the longtime chief of Transparency International Bangladesh, who has spent decades tracking illicit flows of money, is working to strengthen an existing anti-corruption commission.</p><p>“All that’s needed is to get the right people in the right places, remove the bad ones from the organization and create a sense of ownership” Mr. Zaman said. But he added that it was a “mammoth” task.</p><p>Mr. Riaz, the Illinois State professor, said he considered it his “moral responsibility” to help after hundreds of lives were lost in Ms. Hasina’s crackdown on the student protesters in the summer.</p><p>Working out of an office in the empty Parliament building, Mr. Riaz said his goal was to restore the Bangladeshi Constitution to how it was originally conceived, guided by ideals of “equality, dignity and social justice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ali Riaz in front of the Parliament building in Dhaka in November.

He said that he welcomed debate on whether the Constitution should be rewritten or amended. But those who participated in, supported or legitimized Ms. Hasina’s “undemocratic autocratic rule,” he said, will not be invited.</p><p>“When Germany was rebuilt after the Second World War, did they talk to the Nazis?” Mr. Riaz said. “I don’t think they did.”</p><h2 id="link-595795f0">Pressures All Around</h2><p>Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, a lawyer and Hindu leader in Bangladesh, is caught in the middle as relations between India and the interim Bangladeshi government turn bitter.</p><p>In Bangladesh, anti-India sentiments have been simmering since Ms. Hasina fled in August to India, whose prime minister, Narendra Modi, is a strong ally. On Monday, the interim government said it had formally requested that India extradite Ms. Hasina back to Bangladesh to face trial. A spokesman for India’s foreign ministry said it had received the request but otherwise had “no comment to offer on this matter.”<span>   </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In a recent YouTube video, Ms. Hasina accused Mr. Yunus of being involved in the “genocide” of Bangladeshi Hindus, a claim also made by right-wing Indians who support the New Delhi government.</p><p>Mr. Pramanik dismisses such accusations as “political,” saying Hindus were not systematically singled out in the violence that killed hundreds of Bangladeshis after Ms. Hasina’s overthrow. He hews closely to the Yunus government’s message, hoping Hindus, who make up about 9 percent of the population, will have a seat at the table in the country’s rebuilding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The grounds of a Hindu temple in Dhaka.

Last month, for example, Bangladesh’s interim government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/asia/india-bangladesh-relations-hindu.html" title="">charged a Hindu monk with sedition</a>, saying he had disrespected the national flag. India said Bangladesh had targeted a religious leader making legitimate demands for protection of Hindus.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In the interview with Mr. Yunus, he said that Ms. Hasina — and, along with her, India — was the “single biggest destabilizing factor” for Bangladesh. “You want to keep her, go ahead,” he said. “But you must make sure she doesn’t interfere with our politics.”</p><p>Government officials in both countries have since sought to cool things down. Earlier this month, India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, met with Mr. Yunus in Dhaka. Though he noted that India was concerned about reports of attacks on Hindus and other minorities, he said that ties between the two countries were about more than a “single political party,” referring to Ms. Hasina’s Awami League.</p><p>The country’s other major party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or B.N.P., has been another major source of pressure on the interim government.</p><p>The party — run by Tarique Rahman, the son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Ms. Hasina’s arch nemesis — has chafed at being shut out of the commissions seeking to reimagine Bangladesh.</p><p>The B.N.P. says Mr. Yunus has been too slow in offering a road map for elections or implementation of reforms. Last week, Mr. Yunus said that elections could be held between the end of 2025 and the middle of 2026, depending on the extent of the reforms proposed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the B.N.P.’s secretary general, said in an interview that “elections should be held as soon as possible because an unelected government will face a lot of problems.” He was alluding to the growing number of clashes and protests in Dhaka and other cities, including over wages for auto rickshaw drivers.</p><p>Double-digit inflation is an additional strain. On a recent morning, around 100 citizens lined up in front of a government truck in Dhaka that was selling oil, rice and vegetables at subsidized rates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lining up to buy subsidized essentials.

But “if I had to buy it from the market, it would cost double.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><h2 id="link-746c0bee">Individual Futures</h2><p>In a corner of the abandoned Parliament building in Dhaka, a hefty tome on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman lay in a pile of garbage, its pages warped by water. Across town, about 35,000 books celebrating the life of Sheikh Mujib — Ms. Hasina’s father and the man long considered Bangladesh’s founding leader — have been locked away.</p><p>During the uprising, students demolished or defaced thousands of statues that Ms. Hasina had erected of her father. “Students said he is not a deity,” said Mr. Riaz, the leader of the Constitution reform commission.</p><p>But the anger that fueled once-unthinkable scenes of vandalism has cooled. Students have begun to think again about studies and careers.</p><p>Some, like Nishita Zaman Niha, the only female student member of one of the commissions, want to pursue higher education abroad, if given a chance. Even Mr. Alam, the main student adviser to Mr. Yunus, said he wanted to eventually get back to his interests in language and history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sanjana Afifa Audity, left, and Nishita Zaman Niha, who participated in the protests that led to Sheikh Hasina’s ouster.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-37"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A book about Sheikh Mujib lying in a pile of garbage inside the Parliament complex in Dhaka in November.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>For now, though, they are focused on remaking politics into a force for good.</p><p>“What we are trying to do is to create a new platform for politics in Bangladesh,” said Asiful Hoque Robin, a student at Independent University, Bangladesh. “If not for us, for the next generation.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Students Who Ousted an Autocrat Work to Design a Democracy<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Turning Allies Into Enemies: </strong>The United States killed its own allies in Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/afghanistan-allies-enemies-nuristan-taliban.html">sabotaging itself in a part of the country</a> where it never needed to be.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Drives Both Sides in Sudan’s War: </strong>Famine and ethnic cleansing stalk Sudan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/africa/sudan-gold-rush-heart-civil-war.html">Yet the gold trade is booming</a>, enriching generals and propelling the fight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reining In Argentina’s Inflation: </strong>President Javier Milei has been praised inside and outside Argentina for taming the world’s highest inflation rate. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html">But his policies have inflicted widespread hardship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nudging Japan Forward: </strong>In a society used to quiet consensus-building, Tokyo has made bold changes to its defense policy.
