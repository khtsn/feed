Kamala Harris will take the stage in Chicago to formally accept her party’s presidential nomination and lay out her vision for the country.</p><p>Harris has generated a surge of energy and optimism since her sudden ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket — the mood in Chicago is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/elections/democratic-convention-chicago-late-night-parties.html" title="">nothing short of a party</a> — but many voters still know little about her. Tonight is her chance to begin changing that.</p><p>Harris has repeatedly rehearsed an address <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/harris-speech-preview.html" title="">that will tell voters about her life story</a>, frame her contest with Donald Trump as one pitting the future against the past and attempt to reclaim the banner of patriotism for Democrats. </p><p>Harris will also likely pitch herself as a leader who will make life more affordable, funded in part by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-tax-plan.html" title="">significantly raising taxes on the wealthy and large companies</a>. Her only major policy agenda separate from President Biden has focused on economic issues like the cost of housing and groceries. Above all, her years in public office have been driven by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/kamala-harris-policy-change.html" title="">the art of the possible</a> — small accomplishable changes, rather than grand plans.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Thongchai Keeratihuttayakorn, the general director of Thailand’s disease control department.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Narong Sangnak/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-45a5b47f">A deadlier mpox strain is now on three continents</h2><p>Health officials in Thailand <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/asia/thailand-mpox.html" title="">confirmed today that a patient there had been infected</a> by the deadlier version of mpox that prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency last week.</p><p>The infected person was a 66-year-old European man who worked in an African country with an ongoing outbreak. The mpox version was also discovered in Sweden last week, after being concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries. It has a death rate of 3 percent — much higher than the 0.2 percent rate in a 2022 outbreak that infected tens of thousands of Americans, when the virus was known as monkeypox.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Mpox is a close relative of the smallpox virus. The new subtype appears to spread from person to person primarily through heterosexual transmission.<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/health/mpox-emergency-vaccines-treatments.html" title="">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jesse Winter/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-220b2343">Canada ended its brief rail shutdown</h2><p>The Canadian government today ordered the country’s two main freight railroads to enter contract arbitration with the workers’ union, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/canada/canada-freight-trains.html" title="">forcing an end to a lockout that brought the country’s rail traffic to a standstill</a>.</p><p>The shutdown, which lasted just 17 hours, had threatened to cause supply-chain disruptions and higher prices for American farmers, car dealers and other businesses. The trains are key routes for exports of grains, fertilizer, automobile parts and other goods.</p><hr/></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Illustration by Tala Safie; Photos: MGM; Sony Pictures; Touchstone Pictures; Spyglass Entertainment Group; Jon Farmer/Touchstone Pictures; Merie W.

They looked at the prescient themes of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/movies/the-matrix-ai-film.html" title="">The Matrix</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/movies/blair-witch-project-reality-anniversary.html" title="">The Blair Witch Project</a>” and wrote about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/briefing/the-movies-of-1999.html" title="">more than a dozen other movies</a> that captured our collective hope and paranoia that year.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Today, our critic Wesley Morris remembers 1999 as the peak of abundant risk and excitement at the theaters. It was “one of the last years in which nobody totally knew what might happen when you put a movie out,” he writes — especially with standouts like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/movies/1999-box-office-runaway-bride-sixth-sense-thomas-crown-affair.html" title="">“The Thomas Crown Affair.”</a></p><hr/></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, N.Y., this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-7d14d49b">The U.S. Open is free this week — yes, really</h2><p>America’s most prestigious tennis tournament, the U.S. Open, officially begins on Monday. But for those who don’t want to shell out hundreds or thousands of dollars, this week’s qualification tournament offers a great alternative. Hundreds of high-level competitors are playing their hearts out for a spot in this year’s tournament, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/nyregion/usopen-free-week.html" title="">it’s entirely free</a>. </p><p>The event was once attended only by die-hard tennis fans. But it has turned into an entertainment extravaganza with music and children’s events, and spectators can get within a few feet of high-pressure, elite tennis. (The tournament’s famous Honey Deuce cocktail will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/02/sports/tennis/us-open-honey-deuce.html" title="">still cost you $23</a>.)</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cash Cobain at Coney Island before a performance this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andre D.

Sphen, the penguin who became a gay icon</h2><p>Sphen, a male gentoo penguin who lived in an aquarium in Sydney, Australia, earned global fame for his enduring partnership with another male penguin, Magic. The couple’s devotion became a symbol for gay pride, and they drew international tourists with their parenting story. This month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/australia/sphen-gay-penguin-dead.html" title="">Sphen died at 11</a>.</p><p>To help Magic mourn the loss, the aquarium took him to see Sphen after the death.
