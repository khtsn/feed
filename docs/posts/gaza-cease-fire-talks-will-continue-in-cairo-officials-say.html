Israel’s defense minister spoke on Sunday of “the importance of avoiding regional escalation,” while the leader of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, said “people can take a breath and relax.” </p><p>But even if a wider Middle East war has been averted for now, analysts said, Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah, along with the fighting with Hamas in Gaza, show every sign of continuing, their fundamental dynamics unchanged. </p><p>Israel and Hezbollah returned on Monday to<span>  </span>a low-level conflict with smaller strikes, albeit one that could escalate at any point into a bigger war that could draw in Iran, Hezbollah’s benefactor. Hundreds of thousands of people in Israel and Lebanon remain displaced by the fighting. And Iran has yet to respond militarily to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html" title="">Israel’s assassination of a Hamas leader last month in Tehran</a>.</p><div><p>“Strategically, the situation has not changed and we are where we were,” said Shira Efron, an analyst at Israel Policy Forum, a New York-based research group.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke billowing from the site of an airstrike on Zibqin in southern Lebanon on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kawnat Haju/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Clearing debris from a home damaged in an airstrike in Acre, Israel, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abir Sultan/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>A truce in Lebanon is dependent on a truce in Gaza, which remains a distant prospect. Four days of meetings between Israeli officials and U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo concluded on Sunday without a breakthrough, although negotiators said talks would continue.</p><p>Hezbollah has said it will continue its battle until Israel agrees to a cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza. And its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech on Sunday that the militia reserved the right to attack again to avenge Israel’s killing of a senior Hezbollah commander last month.</p><p>“This in practice means continuous attritional war, with constant risk of escalation with no end in sight,” Ms. Efron said. “In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of Israelis and millions of Palestinians continue to suffer amidst a region teetering on the edge.”</p><p>The focus, for now, will return to the Gaza cease-fire talks, which appeared stuck despite a renewed push by the United States and optimistic commentary from Biden administration officials.</p><p>Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is still opposed to clauses in the proposed truce agreement that would make it harder for Israel to resume battle after a weekslong pause, arguing that such a deal would allow Hamas to survive the war intact. Mr. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition relies on lawmakers who have pledged to bring down his government if he agrees to such a deal, even as many Israelis publicly demand an agreement, saying it is the only way to free dozens of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.</p><p>Hamas, for its part, is determined to remain a force in postwar Gaza and has said it rejects any cease-fire that is temporary and does not ensure Israel’s complete withdrawal from Gaza. The group, along with Egypt, has pushed back strongly against Mr. Netanyahu’s insistence that Israel retain a military presence in a narrow strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Israel has said is necessary to prevent Hamas from rearming through smuggling.</p><p>“Hamas is being asked to accept Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip, entirely or partly,” said Ibrahim Dalalsha, director of the Horizon Center, a Palestinian research group in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>“Asking them to even consider such a condition is basically asking them to commit suicide, politically speaking,” Mr. Dalalsha added. “This is something Hamas would never, ever agree to.”</p><p>Julian E.

It was not immediately clear how quickly the vaccines could be distributed in Gaza, where continued hostilities and bombardment have hindered humanitarian efforts during 10 months of war.</p><div><p>The ministry warned that inoculations alone could not be effective, amid a lack of clean water and personal hygiene supplies, and issues with sewage and waste collection in overcrowded areas where displaced families were sheltering. It said medical teams would need to spread out across the territory, “which requires an urgent cease-fire.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Children walking near garbage and raw sewage at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Deir al Balah in central Gaza this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The W.H.O. chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in <a href="https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1826744716492443652" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Thursday that a 10-month-old child in Gaza had contracted polio and become paralyzed in one leg. The virus had been found last month in wastewater samples, but this was the first confirmed case in Gaza in a quarter-century.</p><p>COGAT, the Israeli defense ministry’s agency that oversees policy for the Palestinian territories, said in a statement on Monday that the vaccines had been delivered to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel. The agency added that the campaign would be conducted in coordination with the Israeli military “as part of the routine humanitarian pauses” that it observes, which will allow Palestinians to reach the vaccination centers.</p><p>According to UNICEF, at least 95 percent of children will need to receive both doses of the vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the risk of its re-emergence, “given the severely disrupted health, water and sanitation systems in the Gaza Strip.”</p><p>UNICEF and the W.H.O. requested in a statement that “all parties to the conflict” implement a weeklong humanitarian pause in Gaza to allow “children and families to safely reach health facilities” for the doses. <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/humanitarian-pauses-vital-critical-polio-vaccination-campaign-gaza-strip" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The statement</a> added that “without the humanitarian pauses, the delivery of the campaign will not be possible.”</p><p>Philippe Lazzarini, the director of UNRWA, <a href="https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1826899701003604318" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a> that the agency’s medical teams would distribute the vaccines at its clinics and through its mobile health teams.

Despite a full-bore diplomatic push from the Biden administration, the two sides remain far apart on several critical issues, including Israeli demands to retain a military presence along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Both Hamas and Egypt, which is mediating the talks along with Qatar and the United States, oppose those demands.</p><p>One U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, said the senior-level talks in Cairo were constructive, and would continue with working-group discussions in the coming days. Hamas officials, as usual, did not participate in the meetings with Israeli and U.S. officials.</p><div><p>Negotiators in Cairo were working to refine an American proposal presented last week in Doha, Qatar, aimed at bridging key gaps between the two sides. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-proposal-israel-hamas.html" title="">The so-called bridging proposal builds on an earlier framework outlined by President Biden in May</a>, and includes various amendments aimed at resolving the differences between Hamas and Israel, people briefed on the talks have said.</p><p>Under the proposal, the first phase would see a six-week cease-fire and the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinians detained by Israel. People displaced from northern Gaza would be able to return to their homes, many of which lie in ruins. During that time, Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza.</p><p>The second phase envisions a permanent cease-fire, while the third consists of a multiyear reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the remains of deceased hostages.</p><p>On Thursday, Israeli officials met with those from the United States and Egypt. On Friday, the U.S. and Egyptian teams held a bilateral consultation to strategize ahead of the talks.</p><p>Egyptian and Qatari negotiators then met with Hamas to walk through the bridging proposal paragraph by paragraph. The Hamas negotiators highlighted points of disagreement, which were brought to Egyptian, Qatari, American and Israeli negotiators on Sunday.</p><p>The technical level discussions are meant to continue this week in Cairo, with the aim of getting to an agreement that can be implemented.</p><p>American officials declined to outline the points of disagreement in detail, arguing that negotiating in public could only complicate matters.</p><p>But among the most difficult issues remaining, another American official said, is whether Israeli forces will remain on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, and if so, how many. Israeli officials have reduced their demands in recent days, agreeing to accept a fewer number of checkpoints. But both Egypt and Hamas — which wants a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza — have been skeptical of any Israeli military presence on Gaza’s southern border.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
