The bird, with its bright yellow beak, long wingspan and beady eyes, has appeared at the center of <a href="https://diplomacy.state.gov/the-great-seal/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Great Seal”</a> of the United States since 1782, much to <a href="https://www.nj.gov/drbc/basin/living/benfranklin.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benjamin Franklin’s ire</a> because he deemed it “a Bird of bad moral Character.” It has also been depicted on postal stamps, quarters and the insignia of most military branches.</p><p>But until this week, the bald eagle was only officially considered the national emblem. An act of Congress, signed by President Biden on Tuesday, declared <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4610/text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the bald eagle</a>, whose genus and species is <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bald_Eagle/overview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</a>, “the national bird.”</p><p>The legislation, introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar and Representative Brad Finstad, both of Minnesota, said the bald eagle is “a historical symbol of the United States representing independence, strength, and freedom.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The bird has evolved into a cultural symbol, representing sports teams and American clothing brands, and being written into movie lines and patriotic song lyrics. The spacecraft that landed on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission was even identified with the bird when the astronaut Neil Armstrong said, “The Eagle has landed.”</p><p>With the law’s signage, the bald eagle joins the same ranks as the bison, which became the <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title36-chapter3-front&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national mammal</a> in 2016, and the oak, which has been the <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=118&amp;page=3344" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national tree</a> since 2004.</p><p>The bald eagle was once an <a href="https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/bald-eagle-fact-sheet.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endangered species</a> in the United States, until 1995, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/28/world/americas/28iht-eagle.1.6378215.html" title="">and was later removed</a> from the threatened species list, in 2007.</p><p>In 1940, as the bird’s populations dwindled, Congress made it illegal to kill, sell or own bald eagles, a prohibition that remains in place today. Harming a bald eagle, its nest or eggs are also illegal.</p><p>The protective laws and endangered species designation, as well as a 1972 ban on the deadly pesticide DDT, helped bald eagle populations thrive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Bald eagles are native to North America and can be found in almost every state, but they are most populous in Alaska, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. There were over 315,000 bald eagles across the contiguous United States in 2019, the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/story/eagles-across-america" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agency estimated,</a> four times the population of the bird just a decade earlier.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
