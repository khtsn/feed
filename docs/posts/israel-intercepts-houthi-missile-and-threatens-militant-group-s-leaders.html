The Israeli military later said the missile had been successfully intercepted outside of its territory; there were no reports of casualties.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">The Houthis</a>, who act as the de facto government in much of northern Yemen, have been firing on Israel in solidarity with their Palestinian allies since shortly after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/issue/world/2024/10/21/the-oct-7-attacks" title="">Oct. 7, 2023,</a> which prompted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-oct-7-year-of-war.html" title="">war in Gaza</a>. In a self-declared attempt to enforce an embargo on Israel, they also began launching missiles and drones at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/world/middleeast/houthis-red-sea-yemen-israel.html" title="">cargo vessels</a> crossing the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, significantly disrupting international trade.</p><p>Houthi missiles and drones have only managed to penetrate Israel’s defenses on a few occasions. But experts say their attacks have bolstered the group’s regional clout even as Israel has focused its firepower on weakening other Iran-backed groups, like Hamas and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“From the Houthis’ perspective, the attacks in the Red Sea have been successful,” said Farea al-Muslimi, a Yemeni research fellow at the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, the London research institution. “Even if there’s no direct harm, they are a big win for them.”</p><p>The Houthi attacks on Israel also appear to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/world/middleeast/yemen-israel-houthis.html" title="">growing more frequent</a>, although most have not led to serious casualties. Since the beginning of December, Houthi militants have fired rockets and drones at the country at least eight times.</p><p>Early on Saturday morning, a missile from Yemen landed in Tel Aviv after air defenses failed to intercept it. And last week, a school in Ramat Gan, a Tel Aviv suburb, was damaged after a missile fired from Yemen was partly intercepted, the Israeli military said.</p><p>In response, Israeli warplanes have struck Yemen, targeting power plants in Sana, the Houthi-run capital. The United States has also conducted a series of bombing raids against targets in Yemen in an attempt to compel the militants to stop the attacks, though the Houthis have vowed to continue as long as Israel keeps up its war in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Analysts say the strikes by Israel, the United States, and Britain, have so far had a limited impact on the group, and it is far from clear what these powers can do to decisively stop the Houthis from occasionally shooting rockets and drones at adversaries in the region.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emergency crews inspecting damage last week in Ramat Gan, Israel, after a missile fired from Yemen was partly intercepted.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Levy/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“What we’ve done so far — I don’t want to call it a complete failure, but our operational successes have not yet brought the desired results,” said Danny Citrinowicz, a former Israeli military intelligence officer and research fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. “And our options aren’t good, either.”</p><p>The Houthis are unlikely to abandon their newfound leverage even if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, according to analysts. Simply by firing a ballistic missile every few days, setting off air-raid sirens across Israel, the Houthis could have a profound psychological and economic impact on the country, said Mr. Citrinowicz.</p><p>Israeli leaders have begun threatening more serious action. On Monday, Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, threatened to assassinate Houthi leaders in an attempt to force the militants to come to terms. Over the past year Israel has killed many of its adversaries’ top commanders, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/yahya-sinwar-hamas.html" title="">leaders of Hamas</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">of</a> Hezbollah.</p><p>“We will inflict a devastating blow to the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen,” Mr. Katz said. “We will hit its strategic infrastructure and behead its leadership.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Houthis are farther removed from Israel than Hamas and Hezbollah are — often more than 1,000 miles from Israeli territory — and have survived numerous efforts to quash them since rising to power in Yemen’s decade-long civil war.</p><p>Yemen is also much bigger than Lebanon or Gaza, making the Houthis and their military infrastructure a much more diffuse target, two experts said.</p><p>The United States and Britain consider the Houthis to be a terrorist group. As part of its proxy war with Iran, Saudi Arabia led a military campaign against the Houthis in Yemen in an attempt to restore the country’s government, deepening the humanitarian crisis there.</p><p>Once poorly organized rebels, the Houthis have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/world/middleeast/yemen-houthis-gulf.html" title="">bolstered its arsenal</a> in recent years, adding cruise and ballistic missiles and long-range drones. Iran has supplied arms to the Houthis and other militias across the Middle East to expand its influence in the region, and the weakening of Hezbollah and Hamas has given the Houthis greater relative importance as a proxy for the government in Tehran.</p><p>The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said last week that the Houthis would pay a heavy price for their attacks on Israel. Several experts have argued that President-elect Donald J. Trump is likely to take a harder line against the Houthis when he takes office next month and that his administration could take coordinated military action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But the Houthis have already survived years of bombing by the coalition led by Saudi Arabia, during which time its ambitions appear to have grown, according to Elisabeth Kendall, an expert on Yemen at Cambridge University.</p><p>“They have had 20 years of holding at bay some of the biggest defense spenders in the Middle East,” said Ms. Kendall. “The biggest dilemma is that it looks impossible to influence the Houthis without military pressure, but it’s hard to see how military pressure can work.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
