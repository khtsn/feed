The Israeli military later said the missile had been successfully intercepted outside of its territory; there were no reports of casualties.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">The Houthis</a>, an Iran-backed group that acts as the de facto government in northern Yemen, have been firing on Israel in solidarity with their Palestinian allies since shortly after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/issue/world/2024/10/21/the-oct-7-attacks" title="">Oct. 7, 2023,</a> that prompted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-oct-7-year-of-war.html" title="">war in Gaza</a>. They have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/world/middleeast/houthis-red-sea-yemen-israel.html" title="">menaced cargo vessels</a> traversing the Red Sea in an attempt to enforce an embargo on Israel, posing a threat to international trade.</p><p>The group’s attacks appear to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/world/middleeast/yemen-israel-houthis.html" title="">growing more frequent</a>. Since the beginning of December, Houthi militants have fired rockets and drones at Israel at least eight times. A missile from Yemen landed in Tel Aviv early Saturday morning after air defenses failed to intercept it. And last week, a school in Ramat Gan, a Tel Aviv suburb, was damaged after a missile fired from Yemen was partially intercepted, the Israeli military said. The attacks have not caused any serious injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In response, Israeli warplanes have struck deeper into Yemen, targeting power plants in Sana, the Houthi-run capital.</p><p>But it is far from clear what Israel, the United States and their allies could do to decisively stop the Houthis from occasionally shooting rockets and drones at their enemies in the region.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
