The bank, which sets rates for the 20 countries that use the euro, has been lowering rates since June as inflation slowed toward its target to 2 percent. In November, inflation averaged 2.3 percent across the region, slightly higher than in previous months as energy prices rose.</p><p>“The disinflation process is well on track,” the bank said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>Despite substantial progress on reining in inflation in recent years, other risks are accumulating. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/business/economy/europe-economy-donald-trump.html" title="">Europe faces the prospect of higher tariffs</a> on its goods exported to the United States imposed during the second term of President-elect Donald J.

That increases the pressure on the central bank to support the economy with lower interest rates.</p><p>As inflation has slowed in Europe and the United States, central bankers have eased their monetary policy stances. But in recent months, there are growing distinctions between the banks over how fast and how much they need to lower rates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Earlier on Thursday, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/swiss-national-bank-cuts-interest-rates-by-50-basis-points-2024-12-12/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Swiss National Bank cut rates</a> by a larger-than-expected half-point as its currency, considered a haven during times of geopolitical stress, has strengthened.
