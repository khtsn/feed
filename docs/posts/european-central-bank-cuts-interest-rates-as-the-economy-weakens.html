The bank, which sets rates for the 20 countries that use the euro, has been lowering rates since June as inflation slowed toward its target of 2 percent. In November, inflation averaged 2.3 percent across the region, slightly higher than in previous months as energy prices rose.</p><p>“The disinflation process is well on track,” Christine Lagarde, the president of the central bank, said on Thursday at a news conference in Frankfurt. The bank forecast inflation to average 2.1 percent next year.</p><p>Despite substantial progress on reining in inflation in recent years, other risks are accumulating. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/business/economy/europe-economy-donald-trump.html" title="">Europe faces the prospect of higher tariffs</a> on its goods exported to the United States imposed during the second term of President-elect Donald J. Trump, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/europe/germany-scholz-no-confidence-vote.html" title="">political turmoil in Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html" title="">France</a>, the bloc’s two largest economies, is adding to the uncertainty. Much of the past year has been spent warning that Europe needs to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/europe-economy-competitiveness.html" title="">take drastic action to improve its competitiveness</a>, but it is not clear where the leadership will come from to make the necessary changes. That increases the pressure on the central bank to support the economy with lower interest rates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As inflation has slowed in Europe and the United States, central bankers have eased their monetary policy stances. But in recent months, there are growing distinctions between the banks over how fast and how much they need to lower rates.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/swiss-national-bank-cuts-interest-rates-by-50-basis-points-2024-12-12/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Swiss National Bank cut rates</a> by a larger-than-expected half-point as its currency, considered a haven during times of geopolitical stress, has strengthened. Next week, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/inflation-cpi-november.html" title="">inflation data published on Wednesday</a> added to confidence of slowing price growth. And the Bank of England is expected to hold rates next week, continuing its gradual approach to easing amid concerns the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/2024-uk-budget-summary.html" title="">recent government budget will add to price pressures</a>.</p><p>Staff at the European Central Bank had expected economic growth to be weak in the medium term but had forecast a stronger recovery later as lower interest rates encourage investment, foreign demand increases and wages outpace inflation. But on Thursday, the staff slightly lowered its forecasts for the recovery.</p><p>Growth in the eurozone is now expected to be 1.1 percent next year, down from a forecast of 1.3 percent three months ago.</p><p>“The governing council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilizes sustainably at its 2 percent medium-term target,” the bank said on Thursday. But removed a reference to rates needing to stay “sufficiently restrictive.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In recent weeks, investors have increased bets on how quickly interest rates will fall after suggestions from some policymakers that rates would need to be cut faster. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3779f233-639d-427d-835c-500effc4d174" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fabio Panetta, the governor of the Bank of Italy,</a> warned that there was a risk that inflation could undershoot the bank’s target. “Restrictive monetary conditions are no longer necessary,” he said last month.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eshe-nelson">More about Eshe Nelson</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
