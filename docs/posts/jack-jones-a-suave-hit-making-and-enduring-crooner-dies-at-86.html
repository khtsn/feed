He was 86. </p><p>His wife, Eleonora Jones, said the cause of his death, in a hospital, was leukemia.</p><p>While his popularity peaked in the 1960s, Mr. Jones found a new audience in later years singing the theme to the hit television show “The Love Boat.” But even then he seemed always to have stepped out of an earlier generation, one that dressed in tuxedos for the songs of Tin Pan Alley and reminded America of its love affairs with the Gershwins, Cole Porter, Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen.</p><p>He won two Grammy Awards and recorded numerous albums of American Songbook favorites that hit the upper reaches of Billboard’s charts on the strength of his smooth vocal interpretations. He performed at Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, the White House and the London Palladium, and for more than 60 years drew crowds to cabarets and nightclubs around the world.</p><p>At the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan in 2010, marking his 52nd year in show business, Mr. Jones opened and closed a two-hour retrospective of his songs with Paul Williams’s “That’s What Friends Are For.” He sang to a packed house of longtime fans:</p><p><em>Friends are like warm clothes</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Those lyrics evoked the vanishing breed of pop-jazz crooner, of which Mr. Jones and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/arts/music/tony-bennett-dead.html" title="">Tony Bennett</a> remain the great survivors,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/arts/music/28jack.html" title="">Stephen Holden wrote</a> in The New York Times. “Mr. Jones, now 72, draws the same kind of well-dressed sophisticated audiences that used to attend the annual appearances at the defunct Michael’s Pub of his friend Mel Tormé, who died 11 years ago at 73.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Jones with his fellow vocalist Tony Bennett in 1972.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Holden called the show “a kind of master class in traditional nightclub performance: suave but intimate, alternately preening and humble, seemingly casual but seamlessly professional,” adding, “most of the old songs responded to Mr. Jones’s thoughtful outlook, which tinges everything with the sense of a man taking a moral inventory of his life.”</p><p>Mr. Jones, the son of the Hollywood actress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/26/arts/irene-hervey-89-film-actress-hailed-in-destry-rides-again.html" title="">Irene Hervey</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/30/arts/allan-jones-84-hollywood-singing-star-is-dead.html" title="">Allan Jones</a>, the tenor singing star of the 1930s and ’40s who romped with the Marx Brothers in “A Night at the Opera” and “A Day at the Races,” started out in a Las Vegas father-and-son act when he was 19, in which he tried to copy his dad’s forceful style. It was a mistake.</p><p>“My voice was less mature than his,” Mr. Jones told The Times in 1964. “We had a well-received act with a lot of references to Mom and home. But then my folks were divorced, and that knocked the wind out of the whole thing. I went out on my own, and my salary dropped, but I felt better.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He began recording and singing in clubs, but with a different approach: crooning the lyrics. It was a magical transformation of his singing style and stage presence to something more casual, and it made an intimate emotional connection with audiences. It became his trademark.</p><p>On the 1960s pop scene, Mr. Jones was an anomaly, ignoring rock ’n’ roll in favor of big-band arrangements, romantic ballads and the American Songbook.</p><p>He recorded dozens of albums n the Kapp label, including “Dear Heart,” “Shall We Dance,” “She Loves Me,” “Call Me Irresponsible,” “I’ve Got a Lot of Livin’ to Do” and “The Jack Jones Christmas Album.” He won Grammy Awards for best solo male vocal performance for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EAELtJgD6A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Lollipops and Roses”</a> in 1962 and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZbusN-n8rE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Wives and Lovers”</a> in 1964.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He sang the title songs of several films, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMuyMCCWQi0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Love With the Proper Stranger”</a> (1963), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e72FLtfI748" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Where Love Has Gone”</a> (1964) and “A Ticklish Affair” (1963). He sang at White House parties during the presidencies of Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan and performed twice for Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family.</p><p>Mr. Jones reached No. 1 on the Billboard easy listening chart with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THY15gW2jBI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Impossible Dream”</a> (1966) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKqye4j21Jk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Lady”</a> (1967). He was a staple on television variety shows hosted by Dinah Shore, Ed Sullivan, Andy Williams, Carol Burnett, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, Judy Garland and Steve Allen. And millions more heard him singing the theme to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29oa_ylZrVM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Love Boat”</a> when they tuned into that hit ABC series from 1977 through 1985. (He was replaced by Dionne Warwick for the show’s last season.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Onstage, he appeared in regional productions of “The Pajama Game,” “Oklahoma!” and “She Loves Me” and starred in a 1995 Los Angeles production of “South Pacific.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Jones and his father, the singer Allan Jones, played father and son in a 1980 episode of “The Love Boat,” the series for which Jack Jones sang the title song.

He had a half brother, Ted Jones, and an adopted half sister, Gail Jones, by a previous marriage of his father’s.</p><p>Jack, as he was always known, attended the Nellie Coffman School in Palm Springs and, for two years, the Principia School, a Christian Science boarding institution in St. Louis. He also had private drama and singing tutors at home, hired by his father. He was self-conscious about his privileged life when he enrolled at University High School in Los Angeles, class of 1956. His father sometimes drove him to school, but dropped him off a block or two away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I didn’t try to hide it, but I didn’t flaunt it either,” Mr. Jones said of his rarefied status in an interview for this obituary in 2020. University High had a diverse student body, he noted, but over the years its students had included Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and Jeff Bridges.</p><p>“Nancy Sinatra and I were good friends,” he said. “Her father came to sing for us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Jones at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel in 2010.

He married Eleonora Donata Peters in 2009.</p><p>In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Crystal Thomas, from his marriage to Ms. Nuckols; another daughter, Nicole Ramasco, from his marriage to Ms. Ely; two stepdaughters, Nicole Whitty and Colette Peters, from his marriage to Ms. Peters; and three grandchildren.</p><p>Mr. Jones continued to appear at casinos, performing arts centers and cabarets into his 80s. </p><p>“There’s a time when everybody has to stop,” he told The Times in 2020. “That moment is closer to me than it was a year ago. But if I never get on another airplane, I’ll be a happy man.”</p><p>Ash Wu<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Robert D.
