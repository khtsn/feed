Trump’s cabinet choices run the gamut from people who acknowledge the threat of climate change to those who deny the scientific consensus that emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are dangerously heating the planet.</p><p>But virtually all support Mr. Trump’s plan to extract more oil and gas and erase environmental rules, which would exacerbate global warming. And some who once acknowledged the problem now downplay the danger.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s cabinet is shaping up to be the polar opposite of President Biden’s on environmental matters. Mr. Biden applied what he called a “whole of government approach” to climate change, directing each of his cabinet secretaries to prioritize the issue.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who mocks climate change, wants agencies across the federal government to make it easier and more profitable for oil and gas companies.</p><p>Here’s a sampling of how his cabinet picks view climate change and energy.</p><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Allison Robbert</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-136456f2">Elon Musk, Department of Government Efficiency</h2><p>Mr. Trump has said Mr. Musk will help lead a new panel to radically restructure the government by cutting staff and budgets. Environmental agencies are expected to be a chief target.</p><p><strong>What he has said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>We shouldn’t be complacent about changing the chemical constituency of our atmosphere &amp; oceans, but climate change definitely will not end the world as we know it! If people keep pushing hard, humanity will solve the sustainable energy problem in time. — Sept. 10, 2023, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1701002690489372921" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>What else to know:</strong></p><p>Mr. Musk has consistently acknowledged climate change and supported clean energy. But he also has made conflicting statements, saying both “we should bias toward sustainable energy” and “we don’t have to rush” to renewables. The International Energy Agency disagrees, and says that nations must quickly cut their emissions and transition away from fossil fuels to meet climate goals.</p><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evan Vucci/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-2aa7c2d6">Vivek Ramaswamy, Department of Government Efficiency</h2><p>Mr. Ramaswamy, a onetime Republican presidential hopeful, will oversee along with Mr. Musk the paring down of government spending.</p><p><strong>What he has said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>ABC News: “Do you believe in climate change?”</p><p>Mr. Ramaswamy: “Well, I think that with due respect, I’ve talked about this in other forums, ‘Do you believe in climate change?’ is not really a meaningful question, because climate change has existed as long as the Earth has existed. Do I believe it is a fact that global surface temperatures are rising over the course of the last century and the last half century? Yes, I think that that is an established trend.”</p><p>ABC News: “As president, would you do anything to try to buck that trend?”</p><p>Mr. Ramaswamy: “No is the answer.” — ABC News <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/weve-run-vivek-ramaswamy-campaign-message-103295920" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a>, September 2023</p></blockquote><p><strong>What else to know:</strong></p><p>Mr. Ramaswamy has accused climate activists who want the country to move away from fossil fuels of trying to “shackle” America to let China “catch up to the United States economically.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick T.

No matter how well you think you know the causation.” — July 2021 New York Times interview</p></blockquote><p><strong>What else to know:</strong></p><p>When he was seeking his Senate seat in 2010, Mr. Rubio <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/09/20/20climatewire-climate-change-skeptics-sweeping-gop-senate-75251.html?pagewanted=all" title="">denied</a> climate change. Around 2018, Mr. Rubio took the position that global warming was real, without acknowledging that fossil fuels are the top driver, and said problems like sea level rise require that places like his home state of Florida adapt. He has rejected policies that would reduce fossil fuel use in the United States and has said there is nothing the United States could do to convince China, the world’s top greenhouse gas polluter, to emit less.</p><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span> </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aaron Schwartz/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-3abbbb28">Pete Hegseth, Defense Department</h2><p>Under the Biden administration, the Pentagon elevated climate as a national security issue and has aimed to reduce the military’s energy use. The agency manages military facilities and other installations that are vulnerable to rising seas and other effects of climate change.</p><p><strong>What he has said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Whether it’s hot or cold, the enemy is here, as far as liberals are concerned. And it’s all about control for them. That’s why climate change is the perfect enemy.

Ambassador</h2><p>The ambassador helps steer the American position on a multitude of climate resolutions at the United Nations, and would potentially play a role in deciding whether the United States continues to participate in global climate discussions.</p><p><strong>What she has said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement is misguided, and harms the ongoing effort to fight climate change while also isolating us from our allies.” — 2017 <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/336033-gop-rep-trumps-paris-deal-exit-misguided/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a></p><p>“Americans have had enough of Joe Biden and far-left Democrats’ anti-American energy policies.” — March 20, 2024, <a href="https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/3/icymi-chairwoman-stefanik-we-need-to-unleash-american-energy-not-restrict-it" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>What else to know:</strong></p><p>Early in Ms. Stefanik’s tenure in the House representing upstate New York, she supported some environmental initiatives, including the 2015 Paris Agreement, the international climate accord that Mr. Trump exited and Mr. Biden rejoined. She voted in favor of halting oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and protecting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. Her political profile shifted as she entered Mr. Trump’s orbit, and Ms. Stefanik’s recent comments and <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/elise-stefanik" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voting record</a> indicate she now supports fossil fuel expansion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-614d304c">Lee Zeldin, Environmental Protection Agency</h2><p>The Biden administration has used the E.P.A. to advance its climate agenda, limiting emissions from automobiles, power plants and oil wells. Mr. Zeldin is likely to scrap those regulations.</p><p><strong>What he has said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>“I think that there is more of an awareness and a willingness to recognize that climate change is real, and Congress is more and more open-minded toward identifying those solutions.” — 2016 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW-TDUZOTRo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> in “Years of Living Dangerously,” a documentary television series</p><p>“There are regulations that the left wing of this country have been advocating through regulatory power that ends up causing businesses to go in the wrong direction.” — Nov. 11, 2024, Fox News interview</p></blockquote><p><strong>What else to know:</strong></p><p>Mr. Zeldin is a former House member from New York whose positions on climate appear to have shifted. Mr. Zeldin often noted that his Long Island district was surrounded by water and backed measures to make coastal areas more resilient. When he unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2022, though, he called for reversing New York’s ban on hydraulic fracking. He has promised as E.P.A. chief to support Mr. Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda.</p><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carlos Barria/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-23cef05d">Doug Burgum, Interior Department</h2><p>The secretary of the interior will oversee where, whether and how quickly companies can drill for oil and gas on federal lands and waters, and decide whether renewable energy projects can get access to those same public spaces.</p><p><strong>What he has said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>CNN: “A new analysis that was released this week by a global group of scientists found extreme heat waves across three continents this month were made significantly more likely by the human-caused climate crisis. Do you agree humans are to blame for what’s happening?”</p><p>Burgum: “Well, I know the climate is changing, we know that. And I’ll tell you in North Dakota, we’re the only state that set a goal of being carbon neutral by 2030. But we’re not doing it with a bunch of regulations. We said we can get there through no new mandates, no new regulations, all through innovation. And that’s happening in North Dakota right now. And again, I think if people want to have a discussion, if they think CO2’s the cause, then let’s get serious about what we can to reduce that. Again, there’s all kinds of things we can do that are more effective than the crazy plans that are in place now.” — <a href="https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1684387943710949379" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNN interview</a>, July 2023</p></blockquote><p><strong>What else to know:</strong></p><p>As governor of North Dakota, home to the oil and gas-rich Bakken Formation, Mr. Burgum has close ties to industry leaders including Harold G.
