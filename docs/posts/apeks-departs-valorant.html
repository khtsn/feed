</span> has <a href="https://x.com/ApeksValorant/status/1978080125108298059" target="_blank">announced</a> their withdrawal from Valorant following their relegation from VCT EMEA. </p>

<p>“Ultimately, while we are confident that we could once again build a high-caliber roster for VCL, the current system no longer aligns with the conditions that initially led us to invest in the space,” the Norwegian organization explained. “We hope to return at a later point, but for now, we bid farewell.” </p>

<p>More specifically, the statement pointed to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/363225/riot-reveals-challengers-and-ascension-changes-for-2025" target="_blank">adjustments made to the Ascension system</a> in 2024, where the length of Ascension teams&#39; stay in their respective International Leagues was altered from two guaranteed years to one year with potential extensions based on performance, as a key factor. The team claimed that it “fundamentally changed what [they] had planned for the 2025 season” and impacted their budget and decision-making over the course of the year. </p>

<p>Apeks first began competing in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1553/challengers-league-northern-europe-polaris-split-2/" target="_blank">Challengers Northern Europe</a> at the start of 2023 with a roster of well-known players featuring <span data-ref-id="1">

<p>2025 proved a difficult year for Apeks. After a multitude of roster changes, they were unable to make their mark on VCT EMEA and ended their season without a win, finishing in the bottom four and being relegated from the league without the chance to return to Ascension. All of their players have since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/news/11479/apeks/" target="_blank">announced</a> free agency. With the organization&#39;s departure from the game, the team&#39;s head coach <span data-ref-id="13">
