  </div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the past two weeks, Mr. Trump and his top officials have questioned that order more directly and openly than any U.S. administration of the postwar period.</p><p>Marco Rubio, Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">met for more than four hours</a> on Tuesday with Russian officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to reset the relationship between the two global powers and seek a path to end the war in Ukraine. At the same time, Mr. Trump called the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a “dictator” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html" title="">blamed him</a> for Russia’s 2022 invasion of his country.</p><p>And the Riyadh meeting came days after Mr. Vance, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/world/europe/vance-musk-nazis-afd-munich.html" title="">speech</a> at the Munich Security Conference, likened the European Union’s policing of online speech to Soviet censorship. He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/alice-weidel-germany-far-right-afd.html" title="">met with the leader</a> of Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany party, which had long been marginalized for some members’ embrace of neo-Nazi slogans and for its links to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/world/europe/germany-far-right-plot-court.html" title="">recent coup plot</a>.</p><p>Mr. Vance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/jd-vance-cpac.html" title="">defended his Munich speech</a> at his own CPAC appearance on Thursday, as did a parade of international allies who took the stage after him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The standard-bearers of right-wing political movements around the world — prime ministers from North Macedonia and Slovakia, opposition leaders from Poland and Spain — welcomed Mr. Trump as a transformational figure in a battle against liberalism that transcended nations and continents.</p><p>They cast their domestic enemies — judges, online speech constraints, civil society programs and mainstream news organizations — as part of an international project to suppress traditional values, religion and free markets, and hailed the new American president as an ally in turning the tide against them.</p><p>“He’s completely changing the international picture,” Balázs Orbán, the political director for the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary, who is no relation, said in an interview at the conference.</p><p>In his speech on Thursday, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian lawmaker and a son of the country’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coup-charges.html" title="">charged this week</a> with attempting a coup to stay in power after losing the 2022 election, described his country as “a laboratory” that was “being used as a testing ground for the judicial weaponization against conservatives, libertarians and Christians — always under the pretense of protecting democracy.”</p><p>In particular, the foreign delegations at CPAC celebrated the effort being led by Elon Musk to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/elon-musk-republicans-international-development.html" title="">eliminate the United States Agency for International Development</a> and the civil society programs it funds around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Such programs have enjoyed broad bipartisan backing for years in the United States, and similar support in the European Union, which has joined the United States in financing independent news media, rule-of-law programs and, more recently, efforts to curb online misinformation around the world. But these efforts have incensed the ascendant right-wing parties, which have often run afoul of them.</p><p>Mr. Bolsonaro, in his speech, accused U.S.A.I.D. of “channeling resources into censorship, judicial overreach and political persecution.”</p><p>Mr. Musk’s abrupt embrace of these grievances against the American development agency reflects the growing influence of the global right on the American right — a connection commemorated at CPAC when President Javier Milei of Argentina, who has become a celebrity on the American right, bounded onstage to present Mr. Musk with the chain saw he had wielded theatrically during his 2023 presidential campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At CPAC on Thursday, President Javier Milei of Argentina, left, presented Elon Musk with the chain saw he had used during his 2023 campaign to promote his intention to cut public spending.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>This year’s CPAC was perhaps the fullest fruition yet of the vision of right-wing solidarity that some in Mr. Trump’s political orbit, most notably his onetime White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/world/europe/italy-steve-bannon-matteo-salvini.html" title="">tried to foment</a> during the first Trump administration.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Bannon, who spoke at CPAC on Thursday, threatened to fracture the coalition, however, raising his hand briefly at the end of his speech in what appeared to many to be a reference to a Nazi salute — a gesture that recalled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/elon-musk-roman-salute-nazi.html" title="">a similar salute by Mr. Musk</a> at Mr. Trump’s inauguration rally last month.</p><p>Mr. Bannon’s gesture, which he denied was a Nazi reference, prompted Jordan Bardella, the leader of France’s far-right National Rally party, to cancel his planned CPAC speech on Friday. In a statement, he said he had made the decision “immediately” after seeing Mr. Bannon make a “gesture referring to Nazi ideology.”</p><p>But another international speaker on the Friday program, the Mexican actor and political activist Eduardo Verástegui, leaned into Mr. Bannon’s provocation, raising his arm in a similar salute at the conclusion of his own speech.</p><p>Speaking on Thursday, the British politician Nigel Farage, among the first from abroad to make connections with the right wing of the Republican Party in the Obama years, remarked on how far the right had come since.</p><p>“How amazing it is — 13 years ago, I was the only foreign speaker” at CPAC, said Mr. Farage, who was a key figure in the Brexit campaign of 2016, an early victory in the global right-wing resurgence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Other speakers had followed Mr. Farage’s lead in crusading against the European Parliament and European Union bureaucracy, which they cast as part of the global network of institutions biased against their movement.</p><p>“My government was punished for standing up to Brussels,” said Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Poland from 2017 to 2023, when his right-wing Law and Justice Party was ousted from power by Civic Platform, a center-right party.</p><p>Mr. Orbán, the Hungarian official, whose government has been a model to many like-minded political activists in the global right, said right-wing political movements were less naturally predisposed to cooperate than liberal movements. But he argued that increasingly shared interests — blocking immigration, centering Christianity in public life and skepticism of the war in Ukraine — were drawing the disparate movements together.</p><p>“It’s complicated, because if you are a national conservative, it means that you want the best for your country, and your country’s national interests can be confrontational with other countries’ national interests,” he said. “But we still have to do it, try to identify the shared points — and now there are many, many points.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Charles Homans is a reporter for The Times and The Times Magazine, covering national politics.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/conservative-political-action-conference">Conservative Political Action Conference</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jd-vance">JD Vance</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/liz-truss">Liz Truss</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/jair-bolsonaro">Jair Bolsonaro</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Cuts to 9/11 Aid</strong><strong>: </strong>The group led by Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/nyregion/doge-ground-zero-health-care-cuts.html">made cuts to a federal program that administers aid to 9/11 responders</a>, drawing bipartisan pushback.
