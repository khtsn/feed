data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A 311-year-old Stradivarius violin sold for $11.25 million at Sotheby’s on Friday, in a closely watched auction that drew interest from investors, collectors and classical musicians.</p><p>The violin was made by the famed Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari in 1714, during the so-called golden period of violin making. It was later owned by one of the greatest violinists of the 19th century, the Hungarian-born virtuoso Joseph Joachim, a close associate of Johannes Brahms.</p><p>The Stradivarius was sold by the New England Conservatory, which plans to use the proceeds of the sale to endow a student scholarship program. The instrument was previously owned by an alumnus of the school, Si-Hon Ma, who died in 2009. His estate donated the instrument to the New England Conservatory in 2015 with a provision that it could one day be sold to finance student scholarships.</p><p>“Now we really have the chance to have it benefit so many more students — generations of students to come,” said Andrea Kalyn, the president of the conservatory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Among violins sold publicly at auction, the current record is held by the so-called “Lady Blunt” Stradivarius, once owned by the granddaughter of Lord Byron, which sold in 2011 for $15.9 million.</p><p>The instrument sold on Friday was one of several violins owned by Joachim, who premiered the Brahms violin concerto in 1879.</p><p>Simin Ganatra, the chair of the strings department at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University in Bloomington, said the connection to Joachim, who was also a composer, was a major selling point.</p><p>“For a musician to play the instrument he once played is a magical experience and something you really cannot put a price on,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The violin that sold Friday is known as the “Joachim-Ma” Stradivarius. Rare violins once owned by famed virtuosos like Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz and Yehudi Menuhin have sold privately in recent years for up to $20 million, according to dealers. The instruments they played typically bear their names.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The violinist Joseph Joachim.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Popper/Popperfoto, via Getty Images/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The auction of the “Joachim-Ma” violin drew substantial news media attention in recent weeks. Sotheby’s called the instrument a “masterpiece of sound” and initially estimated the sale at $12 to $18 million. But the bidding began at $8 million, and it sold for $10 million. With buyer’s fees, the price came to $11.25 million.</p><p>Before the auction on Friday, the violinist Geneva Lewis, a graduate of the New England Conservatory, performed the Largo from Bach’s Sonata No. 3 on the “Joachim-Ma” violin.</p><p>While there is a booming market for Stradivarius instruments, the skyrocketing prices have put them out of reach for most violinists. Collectors and institutions sometimes buy them and lend them out to performers.</p><p>The New England Conservatory allowed four students to use the “Joachim-Ma” Stradivarius over the past decade for a period of one to two years, according to Kalyn. She said that having a rare instrument of that caliber at the conservatory was a privilege, but that the school felt a sale could help even more students.</p><p>“It’s really about what’s the most powerful use of the instrument,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Javier C.
