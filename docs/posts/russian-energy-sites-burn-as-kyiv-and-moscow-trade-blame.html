Russian officials said the fire had spread to more than 100,000 square feet.</p><p>Kyiv and Moscow agreed this week to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html" title="">30-day cease-fire on strikes against energy infrastructure</a>, the first major step toward de-escalation in more than three years of war. The agreement followed separate phone calls between President Trump and the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to broker the partial cease-fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the details of how and when this partial truce would take hold remain unresolved and are expected to be hammered out in U.S.-mediated talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said his country would draw up a list of infrastructure facilities that could be covered by the cease-fire to avoid misunderstandings.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia-energy-infrastructure.html" title="">Strikes on energy facilities</a> have been central to each side’s efforts to weaken the other throughout the war. Russia has pounded Ukraine’s power grid, aiming to make life unbearable for civilians and hinder the country’s war effort. Ukraine’s strikes on Russian facilities focus on crippling its vast oil industry, cutting off revenues that finance its military operations.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Ukrainian national railway said its power system <a href="https://t.me/UkrzalInfo/6646" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had been attacked</a>. The same day, Russia said Ukrainian drones <a href="https://t.me/opershtab23/12797" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attacked the fuel depot</a> in the Krasnodar region. Neither claim could be independently verified.</p><p>Both sides have an interest in blaming the other for violating the cease-fire before it even begins, seeking to portray their opponent as untrustworthy. Against that backdrop, Friday’s attack on the Russian gas facility fit neatly into this propaganda war.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Trump declined to say whether he would impose sanctions he has threatened against Russia for attacks on Ukraine. He also avoided acknowledging that Russia had invaded Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“They’re fighting against each other,” he told reporters, adding that he thought there would be a cease-fire “pretty soon.” He said that “contracts” aimed at “dividing up the lands” were being negotiated.</p><p>The gas facility that caught fire sits just across the border from Ukraine, near the town of Sudzha, in territory that Ukrainian forces seized during their incursion into Russia’s western Kursk region last summer. But recent Russian advances have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/world/europe/kursk-russia-ukraine.html" title="">pushed back Ukrainian troops in the area from all but a sliver of land</a>, and it was unclear whether they still controlled the gas site as of Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Russian soldier in the Kursk region on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tatyana Makeyeva/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia/50400" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russian Defense Ministry</a> said Ukraine had “deliberately” blown up the Sudzha gas metering station as its military retreated from the area. It called the attack “a deliberate provocation” designed to “discredit the peace initiatives of the U.S. president.”</p><p>The Ukrainian Army, though, suggested the explosion was a so-called false flag operation by Russia designed to put the blame on Ukraine. It said Russia had “repeatedly shelled” the station in the past as it counterattacked Ukrainian troops in the area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Russians continue to create numerous fakes and seek to mislead the international community,” the army said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1HhuUNPQpT/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>.</p><p>Until recently, the station was the sole transit point for Russian gas to the European Union through Ukraine. It ceased operations on Jan. 1, after Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/world/europe/russia-ukraine-natural-gas-europe.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">refused to renew the transit agreement</a>, part of a broader push by Kyiv and its allies to reduce reliance on Russian energy.</p><p>That means Friday’s attack on the station will not immediately affect Russian gas exports. But if the damage is severe, it could have long-term consequences and hinder a potential resumption of exports after the war.</p><p>Damien Ernst, an energy expert and professor at the University of Liège in Belgium, said videos of the aftermath of the attack suggested that some equipment, including pipelines, had been hit, causing what he described as “significant” damage that could take several months to repair.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/ukraine-attacks-russia-airbase-engels-drones.html" title="">separate attack on Thursday</a>, Ukraine struck weapons warehouses at a military airfield deep inside Russian territory. <a href="https://maxar.mediavalet.com/galleries/61be2dbb-80e7-401f-8a32-6c9e72bb894c_d84819c4-19b6-4611-a6bb-46d8bcb414d4-ExternalUser/8e43d712-8a12-46dc-8b61-01c3ef75e20c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Verified satellite images from after the attack</a> showed multiple craters at the base and what looked like blown-up ammunition depots.</p><p>Ivan Nechepurenko<!-- -->, <!-- -->Arijeta Lajka<!-- --> and <!-- -->Malachy Browne<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
