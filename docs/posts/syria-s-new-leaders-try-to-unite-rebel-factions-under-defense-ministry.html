He blamed an ambush by loyalists in the former Assad regime for the killings.</p><p>The war monitor reported that a military <a href="https://www.syriahr.com/%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B2%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%8A/742449/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patrol in Tartus</a> had been looking for the former director of military justice in the Assad government, Muhammad Kanjo Hassan, in connection with the deaths of thousands of prisoners in Syria’s notorious Sednaya prison, when it confronted members of his family and other armed gunmen. The patrol was ambushed, and the former justice director apparently was not apprehended.</p><p>The operations command said it was also conducting security operations in Damascus, al-Jobeh and the city of Homs to capture forces from the former Assad regime that had fired on civilians. A curfew was imposed on Homs, Tartus‎ and Latakia from 8 p.m. Wednesday to 8 a.m. Thursday.</p><p>The clashes and curfew occurred as the new administration pushed to disband the country’s armed factions, a logical step for a leadership trying to establish a single national military.</p><p>Ahmed al-Shara, the leader of the offensive that overthrew the Assad dictatorship, has also taken other actions recently aimed at building a new state. His administration has appointed a caretaker prime minister to lead a transitional government until March 2025 and has promised that a legal committee would draft a new constitution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Khalifa, the adviser with at the International Crisis Group, said she met Mr. al-Shara earlier this week and was under the impression that dissolving the rebel factions was a top priority for Syria’s new leaders because “wayward factions” were acting outside their command in parts of rural Syria.</p><p>The agreement to unite the rebels was reported on Tuesday. Pictures posted on social media the same day showed Mr. al-Shara meeting with dozens of rebel faction leaders, many of them clad in military uniforms.</p><p>Mr. al-Shara, formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has participated in official meetings recently wearing a business suit rather than a military uniform. Since his faction, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, routed Mr. al-Assad, he has presented himself as more of a statesman and less of a rebel leader, and has espoused relatively moderate political positions despite past links to Islamist extremists.</p><p>On Sunday, he said at a news conference that the “logic of a state is different from the logic of a revolution.” He spoke standing alongside Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“We absolutely will not allow for weapons outside the framework of the state,” Mr. al-Shara said, adding that he was referring both to rebel groups and to a Kurdish-led militia, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, who are separate from the rebels.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In a photo released by Syrian state media, Ahmed al-Shara, who led the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, attended a meeting with rebel faction chiefs in Damascus, Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sana, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Syrian Democratic Forces control an autonomous region dominated by Kurds in northeastern Syria, while the rebel groups hold sway in other parts of the country.

But The New York Times was not able to independently verify that. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/kurdish-forces-syria-turkey-isis-america.html" title="">Syrian Democratic Forces</a> did not appear to have signed on.</p><p>Farhad Shami, a new media official with the Syrian Democratic Forces, said his group wasn’t opposed in principle to being integrated into a new Syrian military, but the matter required discussions with the new leaders in Damascus without the intervention of regional powers.</p><p>He said the Syrian Democratic Forces would like to speak with their counterparts in Damascus about fighting the Islamic State, writing a new constitution that guarantees the rights of all Syrians, holding elections and forming an inclusive government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Kurdish-led force has been battling the Islamic State in Syria for years with U.S. military backing.
