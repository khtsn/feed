His administration has appointed a caretaker prime minister to lead a transitional government until March 2025 and has promised that a legal committee would draft a new constitution.</p><p>Disbanding the country’s armed factions was a logical step for a leadership trying to establish a single national military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They are trying to build a state,” said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, which researches global crises. “You can’t build a state while you have a million and one militias running around doing their own things.”</p><p>Ms. Khalifa, who met Mr. al-Shara earlier this week, said she was under the impression that dissolving the rebel factions was a top priority for Syria’s new leaders because “wayward factions” were acting outside their command in parts of rural Syria.</p><p>The agreement to unite the rebels was reported on Tuesday. Pictures posted on social media the same day showed Mr. al-Shara meeting with dozens of rebel faction leaders, many of them clad in military uniforms.</p><p>Mr. al-Shara, formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has participated in official meetings recently wearing a business suit rather than a military uniform. Since his faction, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, routed Mr. al-Assad, he has presented himself as more of a statesman and less than a rebel leader, and has espoused relatively moderate political positions despite past links to Islamist extremists.</p><p>On Sunday, he said at a news conference that the “logic of a state is different from the logic of a revolution.” He spoke standing alongside Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“We absolutely will not allow for weapons outside the framework of the state,” Mr. al-Shara said, adding that he was referring both to rebel groups and to a Kurdish-led militia, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, who are separate from the rebels.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In a photo released by Syrian state media, Ahmed al-Shara, who led the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, attended a meeting with rebel faction chiefs in Damascus, Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sana, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Syrian Democratic Forces control an autonomous region dominated by Kurds in northeastern Syria, while the rebel groups hold sway in other parts of the country. A rebel alliance with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in the lead helped topple the Assad dictatorship.</p><p>The Sana report said all rebel factions signed on to Tuesday’s unity agreement. But The New York Times was not able to independently verify that. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/kurdish-forces-syria-turkey-isis-america.html" title="">Syrian Democratic Forces</a> did not appear to have signed on.</p><p>Farhad Shami, a new media official with the Syrian Democratic Forces, said his group wasn’t opposed in principle to being integrated into a new Syrian military, but the matter required discussions with the new leaders in Damascus without the intervention of regional powers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He said the Syrian Democratic Forces would like to speak with their counterparts in Damascus about fighting the Islamic State, writing a new constitution that guarantees the rights of all Syrians, holding elections and forming an inclusive government.</p><p>The Kurdish-led force has been battling the Islamic State in Syria for years with U.S. military backing. Neighboring Turkey is hostile to the Kurdish force, viewing it as an extension of a Kurdish group in Turkey that has been fighting the Turkish state for decades.</p><p>Muhammad Haj Kadour<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
