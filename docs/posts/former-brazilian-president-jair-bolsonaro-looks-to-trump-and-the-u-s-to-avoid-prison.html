So when he finally received a piece of good news last week — an invitation to President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration — it lifted his spirits.</p><p>“I’m feeling like a kid again with Trump’s invite. I’m fired up. I’m not even taking Viagra anymore,” the former Brazilian president said in an interview on Tuesday, employing his trademark sophomoric humor. “Trump’s gesture is something to be proud of, right? Who’s Trump? The most important guy in the world.”</p><p>But reality has a way of spoiling plans.</p><p>Brazil’s Supreme Court has confiscated Mr. Bolsonaro’s passport as part of an investigation into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/americas/brazil-police-raid-bolsonaro-attempted-coup-investigation.html" title="">whether he tried to stage a coup</a> after losing re-election in 2022. To attend Monday’s inauguration, Mr. Bolsonaro has had to request permission from a Supreme Court justice who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/22/world/americas/brazil-alexandre-de-moraes.html" title="">also his political nemesis</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>On Wednesday, Brazil’s attorney general recommended that his request be rejected. Mr. Bolsonaro admitted he would likely be watching from home.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural of Mr. Bolsonaro at the headquarters of his party, Partido Liberal.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That likely split screen — Mr. Trump returning to the world’s most powerful job while Mr. Bolsonaro stays home on court orders — would encapsulate the two political doppelgängers’ starkly divergent paths since they were voted out of office and then claimed fraud.</p><p>In 2025, Mr. Trump will head to the White House — and Mr. Bolsonaro could be headed to prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Three separate criminal investigations are closing in on Mr. Bolsonaro, and there are widespread expectations in Brazil — including from Mr. Bolsonaro himself — that he could soon be at the center one of the highest-profile trials in Brazil’s history.</p><p>“I’m being watched all the time,” Mr. Bolsonaro, 69, said in the lively 90-minute interview, in which he aired grievances, repeated conspiracy theories and confessed his anxiety about his future. “I think the system doesn’t want me locked up; it wants me eliminated.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But developments in the United States have given Mr. Bolsonaro new hope. Mr. Trump, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are leading a global push for free speech, he said, and he hopes that could somehow transform the political landscape in Brazil. “Social networks decide elections,” he said.</p><p>For years, Mr. Bolsonaro has accused a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, of censoring conservative voices and politically persecuting him. Justice Moraes has indeed become one of the most aggressive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/americas/brazil-supreme-court-expanded-powers-democracy.html" title="">policemen of the internet</a> in a democracy, ordering social networks to block at least 340 accounts in Brazil since 2020, and often keeping his reasons under seal.</p><p>That led to a clash with Mr. Musk last year, resulting in the judge’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/world/americas/brazil-elon-musk-x-blocked.html" title="">ban on Mr. Musk’s social network</a>, X, in Brazil. Mr. Musk eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/world/americas/elon-musk-x-brazil.html" title="">backed down</a>. But the dispute <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/world/americas/brazil-politics-elon-musk-republicans.html" title="">drew global attention</a> to Mr. Bolsonaro’s complaints about Brazil’s Supreme Court..</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, has clashed with Mr. Bolsonaro and Elon Musk.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dado Galdieri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>So Mr. Bolsonaro said he was delighted last week when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/technology/meta-fact-checking-facebook.html" title="">Mr. Zuckerberg said</a> his company would “work with President Trump to push back against” foreign governments that want to “censor more.” One of his main examples were “secret courts” in Latin America “that can order companies to quietly take things down.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Brazilian officials took that as a shot across the bow. The next day, Justice Moraes <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2025/01/stf-nao-vai-permitir-que-big-techs-sejam-instrumentalizadas-para-discursos-de-odio-diz-moraes.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that social networks could only operate in Brazil if they follow Brazilian law, “regardless of the bravado of big tech executives.”</p><p>Mr. Bolsonaro had a different view. “I’m liking Zuckerberg,” he said. “Welcome to the world of good people, of freedom.”</p><p>How exactly will Mr. Trump and the tech executives affect his many legal and political challenges? Mr. Bolsonaro was vague. “I’m not going to try to give Trump any tips, ever,” he said. “But I hope his politics really spill over into Brazil.”</p><p>Elizabeth Bagley, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to Brazil, said Mr. Bolsonaro’s wish that the United States could come to his rescue are far-fetched. The U.S. government does not interfere with another country’s judicial process, she said.</p><p>Mr. Bolsonaro has bigger problems than censorship. Over the past year, Brazil’s federal police has formally accused him of crimes in three separate cases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In one, the police said Mr. Bolsonaro took money from the sale of jewelry he received as state gifts, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-arrest-watches.html" title="">a diamond Rolex watch</a> from the Saudis that his aide later sold at a Pennsylvania mall. Mr. Bolsonaro blamed the situation on unclear rules around who owned such gifts.</p><p>In a second, the police said he participated in a plot to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-charges-covid.html" title="">falsify his Covid-19 vaccination records</a> so he could travel to the United States. Mr. Bolsonaro said he did not receive the vaccine, but denied knowing of efforts to fake his records.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In January 2023, supporters of Mr. Bolsonaro invaded Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>And in the most grave accusation, the police said Mr. Bolsonaro “planned, acted in, and had direct and effective control over” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/americas/brazil-police-raid-bolsonaro-attempted-coup-investigation.html" title="">a conspiracy to carry out a coup</a>. </p><p>The federal police recently released two reports, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/opinion/bolsonaro-brazil-coup.html" title="">totaling 1,105 pages</a>, that detailed its accusations, including that he personally edited a decree for a national state of emergency designed to prevent the election’s winner, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from taking office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Bolsonaro abandoned the plan after he pitched three leaders of Brazil’s military and two refused to take part, the police said.</p><p>In the interview, Mr. Bolsonaro vehemently denied any coup plot — he handed over power after all, he said — but he did admit having discussed the decree. “I won’t deny it to you,” he said. “But in the second conversation it was given up.”</p><p>He said he considered a state of emergency because he believed the election had been stolen, but Justice Moraes had blocked his party’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-election.html" title="">request to overturn the results</a>. Then his team realized Congress would have to approve the measure, too. “Forget it,” he said. “We lost.”</p><p>Yet the police said there was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/americas/brazil-soldiers-president-lula-assassination-plot.html" title="">a far darker plan</a> at the center of the conspiracy: assassinating Mr. Lula, his running mate and Justice Moraes. The police have arrested five men whom they accuse of planning to carry out the assassinations, four of them from an elite Brazilian military unit.</p><p>The men, the police said, deployed to Justice Moraes’s neighborhood several weeks before Mr. Lula’s inauguration. They were prepared to kidnap the judge but abandoned the plot after Mr. Bolsonaro did not declare the state of emergency, the police said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The police said Mr. Bolsonaro was aware of the plan. The closest link the police disclosed was that the plan had been printed at the presidential offices and later taken to the presidential residence.</p><p>Mr. Bolsonaro denied he knew anything about such a plot. “Whoever made this possible plan should respond,” he said. “On my part, there was no attempt to execute three authorities.”</p><p>He then downplayed the accusations. “Even so, I think it was just another fantasy — bravado. Nothing. This plan is unfeasible. Impossible,” he said. He admitted he knew the accused leader of the plot. “Everyone is responsible for their actions,” he said. “Although, as far as I know, he did not take any action.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Brazil, the color red represents the political left.

Six months after he left office, Brazil’s electoral court, led by Justice Moraes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-banned-office.html" title="">barred Mr. Bolsonaro from office</a> until 2030 because of his attacks on Brazil’s voting systems.</p><p>Mr. Bolsonaro called the ruling “a rape of democracy” and said he was trying to find a way to run in next year’s presidential election. Two Supreme Court justices he nominated will lead the electoral court before the election, he said. Those judges have told him, he said, “that my ineligibility is absurd.”</p><p>Polls show Mr. Bolsonaro remains by far Brazil’s most popular conservative candidate, but many on the right are seeking new options. Some have speculated about his sons: One, Flávio, 43, is an experienced senator, while another, Eduardo, 40, is a congressman who speaks English and has built <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/magazine/brazil-bolsonaro-trump.html" title="">close ties to the MAGA movement</a>.</p><p>But Mr. Bolsonaro is not yet ready to hand over the keys to his movement. He said he would only support his sons staying in Congress for now. “For you to be president here and do the right thing, you have to have a certain amount of experience,” he said, as another son, Carlos, 42, looked on with a blank expression.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Should Mr. Bolsonaro stage a political comeback, he said he would focus his administration on deepening ties with the United States and moving away from China.</p><p>But first, he just wants to go to Washington this weekend. “I ask God for the chance to shake his hand,” Mr. Bolsonaro said of Mr. Trump. “I don’t even need a photo, just to shake his hand.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is a foreign correspondent for The Times, covering the conflict in the Middle East from Jerusalem.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
