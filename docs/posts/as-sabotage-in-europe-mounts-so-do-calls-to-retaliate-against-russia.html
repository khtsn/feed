Carpenter, the former U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p><p>Attitudes toward hybrid attacks are “similar, in some ways, to America’s complacency about the impact of terrorism before 9/11,” Mr. Carpenter said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The aftermath of the collapse of the first of the two World Trade Center Buildings in New York in 2001.

Some Europeans are pushing to invoke it in response to hybrid strikes — a powerful statement, though what action would result from that, if any, is unclear.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Other potential responses could include retaliatory hybrid warfare, more military support for Ukraine and further economic penalties against Russia.</p><p>Officials identified the drones that flew into in Poland this past week as cheap, plywood-and-styrofoam models that are typically used as decoys to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses, allowing the more sophisticated explosive drones to penetrate.</p><p>They did not kill anyone, but they disrupted commercial flights and stoked anxiety across Eastern Europe, where Russia has long been seen as a more immediate threat than in the West. In its immediate response, NATO invoked Article 4, which enabled members to start urgent discussions within the alliance. Militaries also stepped up air patrols across the region.</p><p>Polish and NATO officials said that one reason they believed the incursion to be intentional was that it involved too many drones — at least 19, they said — to be an accident. The incident again showed what is widely known as NATO’s “capability gap” against Russia — having too few air defenses, which are costly to use, against a barrage of cheap but potentially deadly drones.</p><p>Asked this month about whether hybrid attacks could prompt an Article 5 response, which likely would involve military force, Mark Rutte, NATO’s secretary general, said it was always possible and that NATO would respond powerfully.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Our reaction will be devastating,” Mr. Rutte said, though he would not discuss what it would take to trigger Article 5. “When comes to hybrid, we are not naïve.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Passengers checking the statuses of their flights, delayed when a Russian drone incursion shut down Warsaw’s international airport, at the airport on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Wojtek Radwanski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Some governments are already retaliating against gray-zone strikes in secret, particularly the countries closer to Russia that are under <a href="https://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/aktuellt/2025/01/hybridoperationer-skadar-sverige/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">constant hybrid attack</a>.</p><p>“We’re taking important measures in order to enhance our resilience,” the Swedish defense minister, Pal Jonson, said in an interview. “And of course, we are we are also making sure to make things difficult for Russia, predominantly by supporting Ukraine as well.”</p><p>“Sweden is neither at war nor at peace,” Mr. Jonson added, “because Russia is operating in the gray zone between cold peace and the Cold War.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>On Friday, NATO’s top two leaders announced a military campaign to step up defenses and aggressively counter Russian attempts to destabilize the alliance’s eastern flank. Hybrid activity there has included frequent jamming of radio frequencies, which has been roundly condemned but not contained, since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in Ukraine in 2022.</p><p>Russian jamming disrupted the navigation system on a plane this month carrying the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and delaying its landing in Bulgaria, according to a statement provided by E.U. officials and attributed to Prime Minister Rossen Jeliazkov of Bulgaria. The statement also quoted Mr. Jeliazkov saying that Russian jamming efforts have stretched from Finland to as far south as Libya, in North Africa.</p><p>The European Union is preparing another round of economic sanctions against Russia — its 19th — to further curb its oil trade, and Ms. von der Leyen has been considering how to hasten European independence from Russian energy. She has also been at the fore of efforts to siphon the interest from about $224 billion in frozen Russian assets being held in the bloc to help fund Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>E.U. officials said Russian jamming disrupted the navigation system on a plane this month carrying the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and delaying its landing in Bulgaria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sebastien Bozon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Those who have been pushing to punish Russia for its hybrid attacks have suggested seizing the frozen assets outright, to give to Ukraine’s government and military.
