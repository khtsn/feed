    <h1>Amnesty International Accuses Israel of Genocide in Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amnesty International said it took into account acts by Israel between October 2023 and July 2024, including what it described as “repeated direct attacks on civilians” and extensive restrictions on humanitarian aid.</p><p>Israel has maintained that it is waging a war against Hamas in Gaza and not civilians. It has also blamed the United Nations for mismanaging the delivery of aid and accused Hamas of looting it.</p><p>The genocide accusation is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-icj-genocide.html" title="">acutely sensitive for Israel</a>, which was founded in 1948 in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Many Israelis argue that it is Hamas that should face charges of genocide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/world/middleeast/israeli-military-hamas-failures.html" title="">after its attack on Oct. 7</a>, 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed in Israel and about 240 were taken captive, according to Israeli officials.</p><p>While the Amnesty report didn’t focus on the Oct. 7 attack, it said militants from Hamas and other armed groups conducted “deliberate mass killings, summary killings and other abuses, causing suffering and physical injuries.” It said war crimes committed by Hamas would be the subject of a separate report.</p><p>Under a convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, genocide is defined as carrying out certain acts of violence with the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”</p></div></div>
