They spent months calling for his removal as they sang <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/asia/south-korea-protest-feliz-navidad.html" title="">protest anthems</a> and attended marches in the freezing cold holding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/asia/south-korea-young-protesters.html" title="">K-pop light sticks</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/22/world/asia/south-korea-protest-memes.html" title="">custom-made flags</a>.</p><p>When Mr. Yoon was later impeached and removed from office, young protesters felt that their work had paid off. But as Election Day approached, some of them felt disenchanted by the candidates on the ballot.</p><p>“My one thought on this election is disgust,” said An Ye-young, 20, who is preparing for the college entrance exam. She joined the demonstrations again Mr. Yoon in December, her first time as a protester.</p><p>“It’s a feast with nothing to eat,” she said, speaking over the weekend after casting her ballot early.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For many young South Koreans, the candidates running on Tuesday are not addressing some of their key issues: youth unemployment, pension reform, and discrimination and abuse against women.</p><p>Young people in South Korea face a tough job market. The unemployment rate among people 15 to 29 rose to a four-year high of 6.8 percent in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>South Korea’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/asia/south-korea-babies-birthrate.html" title="">low birthrate</a> has also fueled concerns that its $800 billion-plus national pension fund could be depleted if a growing number of people depend on it while contributions dwindle.</p><p>And the country has some of highest rates of gender-based discrimination in the developed world, along with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/asia/south-korea-deepfake-videos.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">rampant online sexual abuse</a> that domestic legislation has done little to stop. Many South Korean women want the country made safer and fairer for them, but they say their concerns <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/asia/south-korean-women-election.html" title="">take a back seat in elections</a>, including this one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>That doesn’t mean young South Koreans are staying home on Tuesday, though. Several young protesters said in recent interviews that they planned to vote against Mr. Yoon’s People Power Party in an effort to stop it from regaining power.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Goh Hee-sung said he refused to vote for Mr. Lee out of fear that electing him would give too much power to his party.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lee Suyoon, 21, who voted for Lee Jae-myung when he first ran for president in 2022, said she felt torn.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

Young people haven’t forgotten.</p><p>Kim Yoon-ji, 24, said she wished the presidential candidates had promoted policies to protect women. She cited <a href="https://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?orgId=132&amp;tblId=DT_13204_501&amp;conn_path=I2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government data</a> showing that most victims of violent crimes in South Korea are female.</p><p>Lee Jae-myung, the centrist front-runner, has often hesitated to directly address women’s issues. Policies that seek to help women are unpopular among many young South Korean men who view such legislation as discriminatory against them.</p><p>But Ms. Kim, who attended her first political protest last year, said she saw a vote for Mr. Lee as a vote against the People Power Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The party that caused the martial law situation can’t regain power again,” she said.</p><p>Goh Hee-sung, another new protester, said he had refused to vote for Mr. Lee out of fear that electing him would give too much power to his Democratic Party, which already controls the country’s legislature.</p><p>But even though Mr. Goh voted for Mr. Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, he said that he couldn’t bring himself to support the party’s candidate in this election, Kim Moon-soo. He said he didn’t want to support the party that had defended Mr. Yoon after his martial law declaration.</p><p>So Mr. Goh voted for a third-party candidate, Lee Jun-seok of the conservative Reform Party. He said he hoped Mr. Lee, the youngest on the ballot at 40, would bring the changes he felt were necessary.</p><p>“The root of the problem is the deeply entrenched two-party politics,” Mr. Goh added.</p><p>Lee Suyoon, 21, who voted for Lee Jae-myung in 2022 and joined anti-Yoon demonstrations in December, said she felt similarly torn.</p><p>“After seeing the candidates’ campaign promises and the presidential debate, there is no candidate who perfectly satisfies what I want in a president,” she said.</p><p>She was leaning toward voting for Lee Jun-seok, she said, but still undecided.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
