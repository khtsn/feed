<p>&#34;Sucks to finish the year on this note with the journey we passed together, but it is what it is,&#34; vo0kashu said. &#34;I did my best, my friends, just life has different plans for me, so I simply have to stay positive and strong, probably…. I am gonna do my best to support my team from home; and big thanks to Demon1 for stepping up, great to have Champs aura on the team! GOOD LUCK!&#34;</p>
