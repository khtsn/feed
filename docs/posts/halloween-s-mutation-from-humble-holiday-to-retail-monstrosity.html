Perhaps it is time to eat some crow.</p><p>Halloween, steeped in tradition, has transformed from a pagan feast to a celebration with lovingly homemade costumes and treats to one of the largest consumer spending holidays in the United States. Every October — or even earlier — millions of Americans are spending on costumes, decorating their homes and lawns with garish skeletons and spiders and doling out candy bars to little superheroes and witches. But how did this holiday with humble origins become an economic juggernaut with growing global appeal?</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-1"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Homemade costumes at a children’s Halloween parade in Elmhurst, Queens in 1971.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ernie Sisto/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Halloween is a marketer’s dream, said Tom Arnold, a finance professor and retail expert at the University of Richmond. It falls on the same day every year, Halloween items are largely consumable (candy needs to be replenished every year and kids outgrow costumes), and pop culture trends can help predict which costumes will be the must-haves each season.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-4"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ghoulish Halloween decorations at a Five Below store in Manhattan this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Taggart for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Costume testing at a nearby Spirit Halloween store.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Taggart for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Professor Arnold said the 1970s brought mass-manufactured costumes and individually wrapped candy that made the holiday explode in popularity. It also shifted from a more religious holiday to a secular one.</p><p>Even when consumers are worried about their finances, they’ll still open their wallets for holidays like Halloween and Christmas, Professor Arnold said, because “it creates a unique experience at a particular time of the year.”</p><p>“Even during the pandemic, consumers went to great strides to preserve these two holidays,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-16d60861">A holiday with Catholic and Celtic roots comes to America</h2><p>Halloween itself is a combination of two holidays: All Saints’ Day, which was a Catholic holiday that was moved to Nov. 1 to co-opt the other, Samhain, an old Celtic pagan holiday, said Lisa Morton, author of “Trick or Treat: A History of Halloween.” In fact, the holiday’s name is a shortened version of “All Hallows’ Eve,” with “hallow” meaning saint.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bonfire Night celebrations related to the ancient festival of Samhain, in Lewes, England, in 2012.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Samhuinn Fire Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Halloween night in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Samhain (pronounced <em>saa-wn</em>) was the New Year’s festival for Irish Celtic tribes, held at a time when they were entering their long, cold winter. They celebrated it with a three-day festival and scary stories, which is most likely the source of Halloween’s macabre side.</p><p>Halloween made its way to the United States in the 1840s with Scottish and Irish immigrants who brought their favorite holidays with them as they fled from famine. Magazines, a nascent industry at the time, published stories about “quaint Irish and Scottish celebrations” that caught the attention of American mothers who started hosting Halloween parties for their children.</p><p>Trick-or-treating came about as a way to distract children who, by 1900, had taken over the holiday. Kids played simple but mischievous pranks, like disassembling and then reassembling a farmer’s buggy on a barn roof. However, as time passed and America began urbanizing, the pranks became “very destructive,” Ms. Morton said. Communities needed a way to “buy off” gangs of feral children who were terrorizing neighbors by smashing light fixtures, setting tires on fire and even tripping people on sidewalks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/12/multimedia/00xp-HalloweenRetail/00xp-HalloweenRetail-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/12/multimedia/00xp-HalloweenRetail/00xp-HalloweenRetail-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/12/multimedia/00xp-HalloweenRetail/00xp-HalloweenRetail-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A vintage Halloween postcard from 1916 warning of “mischievous boys.” The card features two boys ringing a doorbell and two jack-o&#39;-lanterns." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/12/multimedia/00xp-HalloweenRetail/00xp-HalloweenRetail-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/12/multimedia/00xp-HalloweenRetail/00xp-HalloweenRetail-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/12/multimedia/00xp-HalloweenRetail/00xp-HalloweenRetail-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/12/multimedia/00xp-HalloweenRetail/00xp-HalloweenRetail-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1536w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="371"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Halloween postcard from 1916 warning of troublemakers.

Haunted houses are now a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231016-the-spooky-seven-figure-business-of-halloween-haunted-houses" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven-figure industry</a> of their own.</p><h2 id="link-2c8b2cda">Candy and costumes go commercial</h2><p>When trick-or-treating became widespread, costuming also gained in popularity. Costumes had been a part of the fun dating back to the 19th century, Ms. Morton said, but they took off in the 1950s, when big retailers and costume stores got involved.</p><p>“If you’re a kid, who wouldn’t rather be Superman at Halloween than yet another thief made up from your dad’s old clothes out of the attic,” she said.</p><p>Candy, the most popular spending category for the holiday today, took off in the ’50s, too, Ms. Morton said, as the end of World War II meant sugar was back in stock.</p></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-13"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><section aria-label="Gallery" data-testid="Gallery"><div><ol><li><figure><p><span>1950</span></p><figcaption><p>A Halloween display table at a store in Minneapolis, Minn.</p></figcaption></figure><span>Minnesota Historical Society, via Getty Images</span></li><li><figure><p><span>c. 1950s</span></p><figcaption><p>Children in homemade costumes attempting to bite apples on a string at a Halloween party.</p></figcaption></figure><span>Keystone View/FPG, via Getty Images</span></li><li><figure><p><span>1966</span></p><figcaption><p>A family decked out in their Halloween finest on Central Park West, en route to an early celebration.</p></figcaption></figure><span>Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><p><span>1971</span></p><figcaption><p>At right, Bertha Rivera, Hannah Young and Dorothy Brooks judging entrants in the annual Arthur’s costume contest in Harlem. </p></figcaption></figure><span>Jack Manning/The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><p><span>1972</span></p><figcaption><p>Trick-or-treaters going door to door, and floor to floor, on 108th Street in Upper Manhattan.</p></figcaption></figure><span>Michael Evans/The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><p><span>1986</span></p><figcaption><p>Participants marching toward Union Square Park during a Halloween parade near 16th Street.</p></figcaption></figure><span>Larry C.

During his tenure, Spirit Halloween has grown from about 130 locations to more than 1,500 this year across the United States and Canada.</p><p>When he was growing up, the holiday was solely for children and “by the time you got to be about 12 years old, that was the end of that.” But with more Halloween parties for kids came more opportunities for parents to dress up, so the market for adult costumes market grew. Then came the college students who found the holiday gave them an excuse to party.</p><p>“Halloween today, much different than it was years ago, really appeals to virtually every demographic and every age,” he said. </p><p>Home Depot’s Halloween program began in 2013 and it was “contained to a single endcap of our store aisles with around 40 ‘harvest’ themed products,” Lance Allen, senior merchant of decorative holiday at Home Depot, said. Now, Home Depot offers consumers hundreds of products, including its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/style/home-depot-12-foot-skeleton.html" title="">famous 12-foot skeleton</a>, “Skelly,” which has sold out every year since its debut in 2020, Mr. Allen said.
