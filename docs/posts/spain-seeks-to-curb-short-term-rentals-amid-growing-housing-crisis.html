He went even further on Sunday when he floated an outright ban on foreign purchases of real estate in Spain, but later backed off.</p><p>Americans have grappled with an affordable housing crisis for years, and now <a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/06/confronting-the-cost-of-living-and-housing-crisis-in-cities_b5fa23ba/7a6008af-en.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Europe’s major cities</a> are struggling with a similar problem. Housing has become the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/interactive-publications/housing-2023#housing-cost" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largest household expense</a> across the European Union, where rents have increased an average of nearly 20 percent over the past decade, and house prices have jumped nearly 50 percent, twice the rate of average household incomes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The intensity varies by country, but they have common threads, including the commodification of housing and the rise of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/travel/overtourism-barcelona.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">short-term rental platforms</a> like Airbnb, as well as the so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/business/golden-visa-spain-europe-housing-crisis.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">golden visa programs</a> in Spain and neighboring countries that drew buyers who snapped up housing in exchange for a visa.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In vacation hot spots, locals blame tourists and short-term rentals for the housing shortage.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maria Contreras Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Adding to the strain was a sharp <a href="https://www.jll.co.uk/en/trends-and-insights/research/talking-points/why-europes-housebuilding-crisis-will-get-worse-before-it-gets-better" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decline in housing construction</a> across Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove up prices for building materials and energy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/business/european-central-bank-interest-rates.html" title="">High interest rates</a> by the European Central Bank, meant to quell inflation, buffeted real-estate markets across Europe.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/publications/2023/unaffordable-and-inadequate-housing-europe" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">From Spain to Sweden</a>, the scarcity of housing, coupled with wages that have risen slowly, has made access to affordable homes more difficult. <a href="https://www.housingeurope.eu/resource-1980/2024-the-year-housing-took-centre-stage-in-the-eu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The problem is so acute</a> that Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, recently appointed a housing czar to spur a search for solutions in Europe.</p><p>In Spain, Mr. Sánchez warned that housing is one of Europe’s biggest risks. “It is one of the main challenges facing European societies, including Spain,” he said at a conference last week in Madrid, declaring that affordable housing must become a “right” and a “pillar of the welfare state.”</p><p>“We are facing a serious problem, with enormous social and economic implications, requiring a decisive response from society as a whole, and with public institutions at the forefront,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Whether Mr. Sánchez’s proposals will become law is unclear.

Mr. Sánchez said Spain had the lowest share of affordable homes of any European country, a problem that arose after previous governments allowed many to be sold to private investors.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said  on Wednesday that his government would seek a groundbreaking 100 percent tax on real estate purchases by buyers outside the European Union.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oscar Del Pozo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Sánchez said he would push for a recently created public housing company to have priority over private investors in the purchase of housing and land. Any measure would need to pass Spain’s lower house of Parliament, where Mr. Sánchez’s minority party has struggled to push through bills.</p><p>Yet at a time when Spain has been buffeted by crises, including efforts to recover from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/world/europe/spain-floods-blame.html" title="">devastating floods</a>, Mr. Sánchez’s proposals are a sign of how critical housing is in Spain.</p><p>The urgency is growing as protests become more frequent.</p><p>In vacation hot spots where short-term rentals have proliferated, locals have taken aim at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/world/europe/barcelona-tourism-squirt-guns.html" title="">tourists for the housing shortage</a>. In November, tens of thousands of Spaniards filled the streets of Barcelona to demand a solution. The city’s mayor said that by 2028, it would withdraw all 10,000 licenses it had granted to apartment owners to convert their spaces into short-term rentals for tourists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In Madrid, thousands have taken to the streets in recent months to demand more affordable housing amid rising rents. “Housing is a right, not a business,” the crowds chanted. Another protest is planned for Feb. 9.</p><p>Faced with a similar backlash, governments elsewhere in Europe are trying to find their own solutions. <a href="https://www.ekathimerini.com/economy/real-estate/1258131/government-measures-aim-to-tackle-housing-crisis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greece</a> announced a freeze in 2025 on licenses for new short-term rentals in the center of Athens, which has become unaffordable for many Greeks, who moved away after buildings were converted in recent years to accommodate tourists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators take part in a protest to demand lower housing rental prices and better living conditions, in Barcelona, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bruna Casas/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In Germany, the construction industry was facing its worst crisis in a generation when the government collapsed in December, throwing doubt over multibillion-euro relief packages that the previous government had proposed. A string of prominent construction and real-estate companies have filed for insolvency, squeezing supply.</p><p>And in France, the government has said it wants to build 30,000 homes in priority areas, mainly those where factories are being constructed. Some towns, including Lyon and Toulouse, are building low-cost apartments on top of existing buildings. The City of Paris is mulling whether to convert unused office space into housing.</p><p>“The West faces a decisive challenge if it wants to avoid becoming a society divided into two classes: rich landlords and poor tenants,” Mr. Sánchez said in Madrid last week.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liz Alderman is the chief European business correspondent, writing about economic, social and policy developments around Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liz-alderman">More about Liz Alderman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
