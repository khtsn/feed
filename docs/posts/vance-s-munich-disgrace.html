It does not concern us. Any way of bringing about the revolution is fine by us.”</p><p>Germany’s postwar federal republic, established over the ruins the Nazis made, has been haunted by Goebbels’s taunt ever since. How does a free society guard against being used, and possibly destroyed, by the rights and privileges it grants the enemies of freedom? How does it avoid the postwar fate of states like Czechoslovakia, which allowed Communist parties to gain a fatal foothold in their fledgling democracies? What about Palestinians, who voted for Mahmoud Abbas for president in 2005 and Hamas for Parliament in 2006 — and haven’t had an election since?</p><p>For countries with a totalitarian past, finding the right answers to these questions is hard. Few have done it better than Germany, which remains unmistakably democratic not because it unthinkingly honors a principle of unfettered liberty (no democracy does) but because it vigilantly monitors the enemies of democracy while maintaining a memory of what the nation once was. It’s something for which all Americans should feel especially grateful, given the price we paid in lives to defeat Germany’s previous political incarnations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But not, apparently, JD Vance. The vice president’s speech last week at the Munich Security Conference — in which the man who refuses to say that Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election lectured his audience about Europe’s retreat from democratic values — combined with his meeting with the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party, has caused a scandal because it is a scandal, a monument of arrogance based on a foundation of hypocrisy.</p><p>Why does the AfD dismay so many Germans, including traditional conservative voters? The party began in 2013 in protest of Germany’s fiscal policies in Europe. It gained a further boost through its opposition to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s <a href="https://epicenter.wcfia.harvard.edu/blog/we-can-do-it-angela-merkel-immigration-politics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open-arms policy</a> toward the uncontrolled immigration of more than a million Middle Eastern refugees.</p><p>But the party soon took a much darker turn. In 2017, Björn Höcke, a party leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/the-man-who-would-make-germany-right-wing-again-fd2b97f4?msockid=1c732d0b935f68282fea3cff923569ae" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">complained that Germans</a> were “the only people in the world who’ve planted a monument of shame at the heart of their capital” — a reference to the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust — and that the country needed “nothing less than a 180-degree turnaround in the politics of remembrance.” In 2018, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20180602-german-far-right-leader-sparks-furore-with-hitler-remarks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the party leader at the time, Alexander Gauland</a>, dismissed “Hitler and the Nazis” as “just a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history.”</p><p>Last year, the German investigative news site Correctiv reported that in 2023 AfD politicians had <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-remigration-debate-fuels-push-to-ban-far-right-afd/a-67965896" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with other far-right extremists in a hotel in Potsdam</a>, near Berlin, to discuss an “overall concept, in the sense of a master plan” for the “remigration” of “migrants” to their countries of ethnic origin — no matter whether those migrants were asylum seekers, permanent residents or German citizens. The star of the show was a 34-year-old Austrian named Martin Sellner, who as a teenager confessed to putting swastika stickers on a synagogue before going on to lead Austria’s so-called identitarian movement.</p><p>This record explains, in part, why all of Germany’s mainstream parties refuse to go into any sort of coalition government with the AfD, even as it is polling in second place in this month’s federal elections. Vance may seem to think it’s the responsibility of democracy to embrace any party or point of view; it’s worth wondering what he might have said if, instead of the AfD polling at around 20 percent, an antisemitic and anti-democratic Muslim Brotherhood-style party was drawing a similar percentage of voters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There’s another reason to fear the AfD. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/world/europe/germany-afd-russia.html" title="">The Times’s Erika Solomon</a> reported on a secret session in the German Parliament in which lawmakers heard evidence of ties between AfD politicians and Kremlin-connected operatives. The AfD denies the allegations, but it’s no surprise <a href="https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/01/12/german-afd-party-refused-to-condemn-russia-for-invading-ukraine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that the AfD wants to end German military aid for Ukraine and restart the Nord Stream pipelines</a> through which Russia used to supply Germany with natural gas.</p><p>In its first term, the Trump administration fought tooth-and-nail against Nord Stream, on the justified grounds that it made Germany dependent on an enemy of the West. Someone might ask Ric Grenell, Trump’s former ambassador to Berlin and now his special envoy, why the administration is now so fond of a party that effectively sides with that enemy?</p><p>There’s an argument to be made in a future column that some European governments go too far to curtail legitimate free speech. There’s another one to be written about the many ways that Europe’s supposedly mainstream right-of-center parties, particularly Germany’s Christian Democrats under Merkel, adopted left-leaning positions on migration, domestic security, fiscal policy, energy policy and other issues that drove conservative voters into the arms of the far right.</p><p>For now, the important point is this: Much like a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Munich-Agreement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain British prime minister</a> long ago, an American vice president went to Munich to carry on about his idealism while breaking bread with those who would obliterate democratic ideals. A disgrace.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Bret Stephens is an Opinion columnist for The Times, writing about foreign policy, domestic politics and cultural issues. <span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bret-Stephens-1897344563844527" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
