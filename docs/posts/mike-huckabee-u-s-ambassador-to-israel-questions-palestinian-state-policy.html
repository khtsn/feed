A State Department spokeswoman downplayed his remarks.</p><p>“Muslim countries have 644 times the amount of land that are controlled by Israel,” Mr. Huckabee said in an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd628z2nwyvo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videotaped interview</a> with the BBC. “So maybe, if there is such a desire for the Palestinian state, there would be someone who would say we’d like to host it, we’d like to create it.”</p><p>The United States has long supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would give Palestinians sovereignty in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. That has been American policy since the United States helped broker the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/world/middleeast/israel-palestinian-oslo.html" title="">Oslo Accords in 1993</a>, which were widely expected to lead to statehood for the Palestinians, and, for Israel, realization of the long-held goal of land for peace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Huckabee said in a separate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/us-holds-deep-doubts-about-palestinian-state-ambassador-says?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Bloomberg News that it would be a “problem” if someone wanted to declare those exact territories a future Palestinian state. Bloomberg quoted him as saying in off-camera remarks “I don’t think so” when asked whether the Trump administration supported a two-state solution as ongoing American policy.</p><p>“I know that many American administrations and other European countries have pushed for it. But the question is: Where should that be?” he told the BBC. Both interviews were published on Tuesday but it was not clear precisely when they had taken place.</p><p>Asked about Mr. Huckabee’s remarks, a State Department spokeswoman, Tammy Bruce, told reporters, “I think he certainly speaks for himself,” and added: “When it comes to American policy and certainly where the president stands, I’d suggest you call the White House.”</p><p>At least 146 of the world’s 193 countries, plus the Holy See, support statehood for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p><p>Although none of the so-called Group of 7 industrialized countries currently recognize a Palestinian state, France and Britain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/07/saudi-arabia-conference-to-recognise-palestinian-state-weakens-scope-ambition-diplomats-say" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have recently been discussing</a> steps toward doing so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Next week, President Emmanuel Macron of France will jointly chair a U.N. conference in New York with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to explore the creation of a Palestinian state.</p><p>Before he became ambassador this year, Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and Southern Baptist minister, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/mike-huckabee-palestinian-comments-trump-israel-ambassador/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had said that</a> “there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian” and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/19/in-jerusalem-mike-huckabee-calls-west-bank-part-of-israel/" title="">argued that all of the occupied West Bank</a> belonged to Israel.</p><p>But last fall, Mr. Huckabee said he would “carry out the policy of the president” while serving as the top American diplomat to Israel.</p><p>“I won’t make the policy,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/huckabee-israel-witkoff-middle-east-us.html" title="">he said in November</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
