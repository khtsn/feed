They tugged on the gate of the school where the mother said her 7-year-old daughter had been raped. They demanded that the school be closed, and threatened to burn it down.</p><p>Demonstrators in the small town of Matatiele, South Africa — known for its pristine, litter-free streets — have been furious ever since videos of the mother, Thandekile Mtshizana, were posted online a couple of months ago describing her daughter’s account of being assaulted at Bergview College.</p><p>The clips drew millions of views and have turned the case of the girl, known online by the pseudonym Cwecwe, into the latest flashpoint in South Africa’s long battle against sexual violence, challenging a culture of shame and silence. In rural communities like Matatiele, the case of Cwecwe has touched a nerve.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mountains surround Matatiele, a sleepy town of about 200,000 people in the rural Eastern Cape Province.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joao Silva/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“This time we say it cannot be business as usual,” said Thapelo Monareng, a retail worker who took time off work to attend the protest in Matatiele. “We are here to say enough is enough.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The police have said the investigation is ongoing and extremely sensitive. Tests did not find foreign DNA on the girl’s body or clothes, according to a presentation the police made to Parliament in April. The results of a doctor’s original examination were inconclusive, the police said, adding that they have no suspects.</p><p>An average of 118 rapes are reported each day in South Africa, according to <a href="https://www.saps.gov.za/services/downloads/2024/2024_2025_3rd_Quarter_WEB.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">police statistics</a> for the most recent year available. One in three South African women over 18 — or more than seven million — have been victims of physical violence at some point in their lives, <a href="https://www.dsti.gov.za/index.php/media-room/latest-news/4495-new-report-highlights-the-stark-reality-of-gender-based-violence-in-south-africa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the statistics say</a>. Women’s rights activists have long criticized what they see as a tepid response from the government. Between 2018 and 2023, more than <a href="https://press-admin.voteda.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RNW777-2024-04-29-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">61,740 rape cases and 5,523</a> sexual assault cases were closed without being solved.</p><p>“We come from an era where the penalty for beating a girl and sleeping with her by force was a goat and a few lashes at the chief’s court,” said Thabang Kuali, a traditional leader in Matatiele. While those days are now largely gone, Mr. Kuali said, he hoped that Cwecwe’s case would “shift the needle in how men think.”</p><p>“I saw men marching against rape for the first time in this Cwecwe matter,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers and protesters in Matatiele in April.

And it also would enable better collaboration across government agencies, from law enforcement to health and social services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Students arriving at Bergview College in Matatiele in April, where Thandekile Mtshizana says her daughter was raped.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joao Silva/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mrs. Mtshizana says she reported her daughter’s assault to the police as soon as her daughter told her it happened in October, but that the story only received attention in March, when she posted about it on TikTok after months of waiting for the police to make an arrest.</p><p>She says her daughter told her that a caretaker at the school had asked her to sweep a classroom. The girl recalled that while she was sweeping, she smelled what seemed like burning tires and then fell asleep, said Mrs. Mtshizana. Her daughter woke up with injuries but did not know what had happened.</p><p>Mrs. Mtshizana, who is a police officer at a separate station, said that after her daughter came home from school with stomach pains and blood stains on her track pants, she took her to a doctor, who examined her and then broke the horrific news that she had been raped.</p><p>“I cried,” Mrs. Mtshizana said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6WQPlrQ4uI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video shared on social</a> media. “I cried because I am also a victim of rape. I know how it feels.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mrs. Mtshizana said she had decided to go public because she felt that the police investigation was dragging and that it had become difficult to get updates. Her mind drifted to how she felt when she was raped at 20, she said, and the betrayal she felt by the justice system in the aftermath.</p><p>“I still live with those scars,” she said. “I want different for my daughter.”</p><p>Before the attack, Mrs. Mtshizana said, her daughter had been a top performer in her first grade class. She loved being a big sister. Now, her daughter is reserved and sketches broken hearts, she said.</p><p>“All I can do is fight for her.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Students on their way to school near Matatiele in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joao Silva/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Eligon is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The Times, covering a wide range of events and trends that influence and shape the lives of ordinary people across southern Africa.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
