Preliminary estimates showed that the quake had a magnitude of 5.8, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, though the intensity was still changing.</p><p>There were no initial reports of major damage. The temblor struck just after 3 p.m. and was centered about 14 miles north-northeast of Yerington, Nev., a small town of about 3,000 residents. It was followed by more than 10 aftershocks, according to the U.S.G.S.</p><p>At the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Mason Valley in Yerington, children dove under their desks but nothing fell over, said Nick Beaton, 30, the center’s director of development.</p><p>“The biggest thing that stuck out to me was it felt like the ground was rolling,” Mr. Beaton said. “You could feel the waves of the ground shaking while you were on your hands and knees.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Carson City, Nev., dozens of miles west of the epicenter, the manager of the local Trader Joe’s grocery store, Brian Garland, said the quake was “just a little bit of a rumble — not enough to knock anything down, but enough so you knew what it was.”</p><p>“Everybody just kind of looked at each other like: ‘Was that what we thought it was? Or are we all having some kind of mass vertigo?’” Mr. Garland said with a laugh.</p><p>The earthquake struck during what experts say could be a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/earthquake-california-los-angeles-malibu.html" title="">period of increased seismic activity</a> in the region, after decades of relative quiet. But its occurrence <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/us/los-angeles-earthquakes-attitudes.html" title="">does not signal</a> that a larger, catastrophic quake is any more likely.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/california-oregon-earthquake-explainer.html" title="">earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0</a> struck off the coast of Northern California last week, causing little damage but setting off a tsunami warning that affected five million people.</p><p>Seismologists have long warned that an overdue “Big One,” the likes of which the region has not experienced since 1906, could happen at any time. They have urged residents to prepare as much as possible by assembling emergency supplies and practicing “drop, cover and hold on” exercises with their children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It has been three decades since a significant quake struck the region.</p><p>The Loma Prieta earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.9, shook the Santa Cruz Mountains in California in 1989, leaving 63 people dead and more than 3,700 people injured.</p><p>A magnitude 6.7 quake in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1994 left 60 people dead, about 7,000 injured and more than 40,000 buildings damaged. The catastrophe also revealed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/california-earthquakes-high-rises.html" title="">major defect</a> in some steel-frame buildings, including many high rises, which under extreme shaking could collapse.</p><p>Alex Hoeft<!-- --> and <!-- -->Shawn Hubler<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jill Cowan is a Times reporter based in Los Angeles, covering the forces shaping life in Southern California and throughout the state.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jill-cowan">More about Jill Cowan</a></span></p></div><div><p>Thomas Fuller, a Page One Correspondent for The Times, writes and rewrites stories for the front page.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-fuller">More about Thomas Fuller</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
