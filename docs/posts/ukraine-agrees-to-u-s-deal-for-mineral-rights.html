President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had repeatedly pressed for security guarantees for his country in exchange for mineral rights, as Russia’s war entered its fourth year.</p><p>Previous draft agreements reviewed by The New York Times included no such commitment, and the Trump administration has characterized the deal as repayment for past military aid.</p><p>Three Ukrainian current and former officials with knowledge of the negotiations said that Kyiv was ready to sign the agreement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump had insisted he wanted “payback” for past U.S. aid to Kyiv, shifting America’s alliance with Ukraine to a nakedly mercantile footing.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump indicated that Mr. Zelensky was coming to Washington later in the week. “I hear that he’s coming on Friday,” he said. “ Certainly, it’s OK with me if he’d like to.”</p><p>Mr. Zelensky has been pressing for days to finalize any agreement with Mr. Trump in person.</p><p>The discussions about mineral rights have occurred as Russia has seized the advantage on the battlefield. Mr. Trump has aligned himself with President Vladimir V. Putin while excoriating Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>Mr. Trump has called the Ukrainian president a “dictator” and falsely said that Ukraine had started the war, though the conflict began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p>He has prodded Mr. Zelensky to sign a deal, saying he “better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.” In response, Mr. Zelensky said that Mr. Trump was trapped in a Russian “disinformation bubble.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky had floated the idea of a resources deal last fall to provide an incentive for more U.S. military support.
