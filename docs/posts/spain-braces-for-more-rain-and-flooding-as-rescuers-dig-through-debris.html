That toll was expected to rise as rescue workers continued to dig through sodden towns, clogged with mud and debris, making access extremely challenging.</p><p>Late Thursday and Friday, rains spread to other southern regions. Heavy rain fell overnight in Andalusia, with the western province of Huelva the worst hit. Residents were out celebrating Halloween when sheets of rain began to fall, local news media reported. The authorities urged people to stay home, and avoid celebrating All Saints Day on Friday, which is usually done by visiting a cemetery or church, warning of the risk of flooding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“This Friday the most complicated situation will be in the southwest of the peninsula,” Rubén del Campo, spokesman for the national meteorological agency, said. “The instability will continue on Saturday.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/multimedia/01spain-rain-01-fgth/01spain-rain-01-fgth-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/multimedia/01spain-rain-01-fgth/01spain-rain-01-fgth-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/multimedia/01spain-rain-01-fgth/01spain-rain-01-fgth-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Several cars are piled atop one another in a flooded shopping-center parking lot." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/multimedia/01spain-rain-01-fgth/01spain-rain-01-fgth-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/multimedia/01spain-rain-01-fgth/01spain-rain-01-fgth-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/multimedia/01spain-rain-01-fgth/01spain-rain-01-fgth-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/multimedia/01spain-rain-01-fgth/01spain-rain-01-fgth-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f15c2ae0-438e-52cd-bd9a-7ec21d0d2c9f" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cars in a flooded parking lot in Alfafar, in eastern Spain, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jose Jordan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While the southwest was on high alert, along the east coast rescue workers were still searching through piles of cars flung by floodwater and homes ripped through by mud. Rain continued on Friday, particularly in Castellón, north of the Valencia region; in Tarragona, in the southern Catalonia region; and on the Balearic Islands, off Spain’s east coast, <a href="https://www.aemet.es/es/eltiempo/prediccion/avisos#tab1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the weather agency</a>.</p><p>In Valencia, dozens were still missing. Among them were prominent business executives, older parents in nursing homes and young children trapped with their mothers, according to <a href="https://elpais.com/espana/2024-11-01/ultima-hora-de-la-dana-en-directo.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rolling coverage in Spanish media</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A satellite image of Paiporta, in the Valencia region of Spain, on Oct. 18.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxar Technologies, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The same area on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxar Technologies, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Ainhoa ​​Rojas Mansilla watched as rescue workers combed through her municipality of Catarroja, outside the city of Valencia, where she was taking shelter with friends. Every time a member of the emergency military unit checked a vehicle, she was gripped with anxiety, she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We are very uncertain every time someone enters a garage because we know there may be dead people trapped in the cars,” she said in a text message.</p><p>Despite the presence of some rescue workers, Ms. Mansilla, 20, said she felt unsafe and wanted to see more police on the ground. Her family had all survived the flooding but they remained without water or electricity, and information about what to do in this disaster was inconsistent, she said.</p><p>In the wake of the huge damage suffered in Valencia, some residents have begun to blame the government for an insufficient response to the disaster. A <a href="https://x.com/guardiacivil/status/1852030840546476300" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video posted by the civil guard</a> of a man caught stealing a bag of shoes caused public outrage. Many people sympathized with the man, who was barefoot as he waded through the mud. Spain’s police <a href="https://x.com/policia/status/1852314053336510826" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said they had</a> arrested 50 people, while trying to secure storm-battered neighborhoods.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Debris, cars and mud alongside a highway in Valencia on Friday, where some of the worst flooding occurred.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Ramos/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The flooding has exposed Spain’s economic fault lines. Daiana Iordăchescu, a seasonal laborer from Romania who works in Huelva’s strawberry and raspberry fields, cowered as buckets of rain pounded her shack. The plastic sheeting was not enough to keep water from seeping through the wooden pallets she and other workers used to build their homes.</p><p>“I feel scared, I don’t know when this will stop,” she said in a telephone interview. “I feel like I’m in Noah’s Ark. It’s raining inside my house.”</p><p>Many of the 3,000 seasonal workers in Huelva are in similar straits, their makeshift homes collapsing, but pleas for help have gone unheeded, said Alfonso Romera, a retired ophthalmologist who runs a nonprofit group, La Carpa, that supports migrant workers.</p><p>“These people are the ones who feed us and are essential to the Spanish economy,” he said. “We just want the authorities to put these people under shelter.”</p><p>The regional government in Andalusia acknowledged that seasonal workers were vulnerable but said that no incidents had been reported to their office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The natural disaster has also become a political test for Spain’s fragile coalition government. On Friday, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will visit the national meteorological society’s office in Madrid, far from the worst-affected areas. Observers say it is a show of solidarity for the agency, which has faced criticism from political leaders who say its warnings came too late. Opposition leaders have blamed the government for centralizing response efforts.</p><p>Along with hundreds of officers from the national police, civil guard and other security forces, the military sent a further 750 personnel to join the rescue effort, Spain’s defense ministry <a href="https://x.com/Defensagob/status/1852334599264727517" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
