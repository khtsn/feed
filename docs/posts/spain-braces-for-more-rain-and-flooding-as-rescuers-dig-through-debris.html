Residents were out celebrating Halloween when sheets of rain began to fall, local news media reported. It continued to rain on Friday, raising the risk of flooding in the area, Spain’s Weather Service warned. The authorities urged people to stay home, and avoid celebrating All Saints Day on Friday, which is usually done by visiting a cemetery or church.</p><p>“This Friday the most complicated situation will be in the southwest of the peninsula,” Rubén del Campo, spokesman for the national meteorological agency, said. “The instability will continue on Saturday.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>While the southwest of the country was on high alert, along the east coast rescue workers were still searching through piles of cars flung by floodwater and homes ripped through by mud. Rain continued to fall on Friday, particularly in Castellón, north of the Valencia region; in Tarragona, in the southern Catalonia region; and on the Balearic Islands, off Spain’s east coast, <a href="https://www.aemet.es/es/eltiempo/prediccion/avisos#tab1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the weather agency</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cars in a flooded parking lot in Alfafar, in eastern Spain, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jose Jordan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At least 158 people have died, all but three in the province of Valencia, the regional authorities said. Dozens more remain missing, among them prominent business executives, older parents in nursing homes and young children trapped with their mothers, according to <a href="https://elpais.com/espana/2024-11-01/ultima-hora-de-la-dana-en-directo.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rolling coverage in Spanish media</a>.</p><p>Ainhoa ​​Rojas Mansilla watched as rescue workers combed through her neighborhood of Catarroja, outside the city of Valencia, where she was taking shelter with friends. Every time a member of the emergency military unit checked a vehicle, she was gripped with anxiety, she said.</p><p>“We are very uncertain every time someone enters a garage because we know there may be dead people trapped in the cars,” she said in a text message.</p><p>Despite the presence of some rescue workers, Ms. Mansilla, 20, said she felt unsafe, and wanted to see more police on the ground. Her family had all survived the flooding but they remained without water or electricity, and information about what to do in this disaster was inconsistent, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Debris, cars and mud alongside a highway in Valencia on Friday, where some of the worst flooding occurred.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Ramos/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the wake of the huge damage suffered in Valencia, some residents have begun to blame the government for an insufficient response to the disaster. A <a href="https://x.com/guardiacivil/status/1852030840546476300" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video posted by the civil guard</a> of a man caught stealing a bag of shoes caused public outrage. Many people sympathized with the man, who was barefoot as he waded through the mud. Spain’s police <a href="https://x.com/policia/status/1851911011894182006" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said they had</a> arrested 39 while trying to secure storm-battered neighborhoods.</p><p>The natural disaster has also become a political test for Spain’s fragile coalition government. On Friday, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will visit the national meteorological society’s office in Madrid, far from the worst-affected areas. Observers say it is a show of solidarity for the agency, which has faced criticism from political leaders who say its warnings came too late. Opposition leaders have blamed the government for centralizing response efforts.</p><p>Along with 1,200 officers from the national police, civil guard and other security forces, the military sent a further 500 soldiers to join the rescue effort, Spain’s defense ministry <a href="https://x.com/Defensagob/status/1852051792600928543" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
