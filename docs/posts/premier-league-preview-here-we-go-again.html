You will certainly hear it on Friday, at least once, and then over and over again on Saturday and Sunday, delivered by every pearly toothed host and every red-faced pundit and every eager-voiced commentator. The Premier League, they will say, is back.</p><p>This is not true, of course. It is an anachronism, a throwback to the days when soccer had the common decency to take the summer off and hand center stage over to other sports for a while. The Premier League — all club soccer, in fact — cannot be back, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/world/europe/soccer-olympics-television-saturation.html" title="">as detailed last week</a>, because it never really goes away.</p><p>Chelsea spent the Olympics signing vast quantities of South American teenagers for reasons that remain moderately opaque. Several of its domestic and European rivals used the European Championship and the Copa América as the perfect cover for hiring and firing sundry, essentially interchangeable managers.</p><p>Soccer, club soccer, is a juggernaut, and the thing about juggernauts is that they do not stop rolling. They do not rest up for a few weeks, take the summer off, have a bit of a rest. That sense of permanence, that omnipresence, is what has turned soccer into less of a pastime and more of a lifestyle choice, a strikingly lucrative cultural touchstone.</p></div></div><div><div><p>And yet, by some sleight of hand, those few days before a new campaign begins do somehow feel like the start of a different day. No matter how hard-boiled, how cynical, how self-aware an observer you have become, there is something about the prospect of the new season — new jerseys being worn and new signings being fielded in new stadiums, bright in summer sunshine — that captures the imagination.</p><p>That we all know how it will play out makes precious little difference. Manchester City — legal complications notwithstanding — will win the Premier League. Arsenal will finish a plucky but ultimately quite distant second. Madrid or Manchester will be home to the Champions League trophy.</p><p>There will be championships in all but one of Munich, Milan, Paris and Madrid. Erling Haaland will score a lot of goals. Chelsea and/or Manchester United will fire a manager. Lots of people will complain about the precise meaning of “clear and obvious,” even though those words have not been relevant for several years.</p><p>That none of this will diminish the interest, the fascination, the compulsion to follow along is because of soccer’s other great trick: its ability, no matter how predetermined the destination, to find an endless array of new and inventive ways to get there.</p></div></div><div><div><p>And, in that fading, warm glow of preseason optimism, it feels more apposite to focus on that than the careworn and the predictable. And so, just as it all begins, here are five stories that might, just might, offer a twist to an otherwise distinctly familiar tale.</p><h3 id="link-54ca7d74"><span>OK, OK, Let’s Do the Court Case</span></h3><p>Nobody should be under any illusions that the move by the Premier League to effectively take its perennial champion, Manchester City, to court on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/sports/soccer/manchester-city-premier-league.html" title="">115 charges of cheating</a> — let’s put it simply — is a good thing for the competition. There is no positive outcome for the league. If it wins, then the last decade or so of its existence has to be reconsidered. If it loses, its authority to police its members is effectively shot.</p><p>(The likelihood is, of course, that Manchester City’s case will be heard in September, its verdict delivered in January, and any subsequent appeals — from both sides — will run on until the Earth finally collapses into the sun, which by that stage might be a blessed relief.)</p><p>The solace is scant, and slippery, and perhaps even a stretch, but it is there nonetheless. The other threat that City poses to the Premier League is that its excellence, coupled with its financial prowess, makes the league a little dull. This is a problem for a competition that has always both prided and sold itself on its competitiveness.</p></div></div><div><p>The court case, though, introduces the possibility that Manchester City will actually be interesting this season: It is hard to think of another occasion in which a group of players have been tasked with both excelling and proving that all they have achieved is legitimate. And once that is over, there is the thorny issue of whether Pep Guardiola will sign a new contract. There is a faint feeling that perhaps an era is drawing to a close.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The new faces of Real Madrid: Endrick and Kylian Mbappé.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jennifer Lorenzini/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h3 id="link-4cd53a71"><span>Next Gen</span></h3><p>Endlessly connected and ravenously scrutinized, modern soccer does not really allow for mystery. Somehow, though, one has managed to take hold that encompasses both the biggest club in the world and the nation that, more than any other, is defined by the sport: Why, exactly, is Endrick so obsessed with Bobby Charlton?</p><p>Endrick, the 18-year-old Brazilian set to make his league debut at Real Madrid at long last, appears to self-define as a “fan” of Charlton’s, despite the fact that he is so chronologically detached from the former Manchester United midfielder that there is a reasonable chance his grandparents would not have been around to see him play. Endrick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih5tCRhEYtU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mentioned</a> his admiration at Wembley in March, and then again in an interview this month.</p><p>It is possible that this is some sort of joke, but it is a slightly weird one. It is probable, maybe, that it is a public relations strategy. It is also vaguely feasible that Endrick is serious, and he has spent a surprising amount of time watching grainy footage of 1960s first division games on YouTube.</p><p>Either way, it provides a wonderful subplot to the defining theme of this season in Spain. La Liga is still suffering, to some extent, from the hangover inspired by all those years in which the league was decided and defined by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Endrick and Barcelona’s own teenage sensation Lamine Yamal have effectively been tasked with reviving that rivalry for the AI age. It would be a substantive first blow if Yamal came out as an ardent admirer of Billy Bremner.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 id="link-16ed0982"><span>The End of the Marseille Malaise</span></h3><p>More than any other major league, France is in desperate need of a new story to tell. The league is shriveling in the shadow cast by Paris St.-Germain, and despite its clever marketing strategy as the “league of talents,” it has spent much of the year struggling to find anyone willing to pay to broadcast the latest iteration of P.S.G.’s inevitable procession to the title.</p><p>That is a shame, because there is one genuinely interesting side in Ligue 1 this year: Olympique de Marseille. Predicting that Marseille might do well is, of course, a fool’s errand; no team in Europe is more consistent in finding ways to shoot itself in the foot. But the signs are encouraging: a run to the semifinals of the Europa League last year, and now the appointment of Roberto De Zerbi, a man who was, until quite recently, one of the most coveted coaches in Europe.</p><p>Marseille is, most likely, not the sort of job De Zerbi thought he might get when he decided the time was right to leave Brighton: Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea all seemed more fitting next steps. That he has ended up at the Stade Velodrome, though, should be a fillip not just to Marseille but to France as a whole. If his team can even create the illusion of a challenge for P.S.G., it would be of enormous benefit to the league.</p><h3 id="link-624fa33f"><span>Re-V.A.R.-Lution</span></h3><p>In the far north of Europe, the first embers are starting to flicker. Technology, we have been told repeatedly, is here to stay in soccer. The game, like a shark, does not move backward. The only solution to the growing body of evidence that V.A.R. was not such a great idea is to improve it, not to abolish it.</p><p>Norway, though, appears to disagree. There have been mounting protests against the use of V.A.R. in the country’s top tier, and the game’s authorities there have promised to hold “open” discussions on the merits and drawbacks of the technology before a vote in March on whether to continue with it.</p></div></div><div><div><p>This is, on one level, quite a parochial thing. It will not make a vast amount of difference to European soccer as a whole if Norway decides to call time on what should, really, still be regarded as an experiment. Except that if one block falls, it may well embolden others. By showing that V.A.R. is not compulsory, Norway may yet open the door for deeper, more honest conversations as to its benefits elsewhere.</p><h3 id="link-61866d2d"><span>One Tournament Too Many</span></h3><p>It would be unthinkable for anyone to have to endure a summer without any men’s soccer — even a summer when there’s a women’s European Championship — and so FIFA has, gallant as ever, stepped in.</p><p>Next summer should bring the first edition of <a href="https://nytimes.com/2024/04/22/business/fifa-apple-tv-deal.html" title="">its expanded Club World Cup</a>, an idea that is currently rather better in theory than in practice. Allowing teams from continents that are not Europe to compete with the giants of England, Spain and Red Bull Salzburg is generally praiseworthy. Cramming it into a summer so that players get even less rest than normal is not.</p><p>The success of the idea, though, is more delicate than FIFA might like to admit. There are two futures for the tournament. The first is as a meaningful and prestigious addition to an already saturated calendar, the sort of thing that teams and players are prepared to endure for the prize at the end. The second is the birth of a trumped-up postseason tour to the United States.</p><p>Which one the Club World Cup turns out to be is not, really, in FIFA’s hands. The amount of money on offer to those teams competing does not guarantee it will mean anything. What its success or failure depends on, instead, is not just the teams involved deciding that it matters, but the fans, too. It is up to them, effectively, to determine what place this competition occupies. That is, after all, the one great unyielding truth: It is the people who watch, and the people who play, who get to decide what is important.</p></div></div><div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mauricio Pochettino: Mr. Fix-It?</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Isabel Infantes/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-61c96b1c">U.S. Soccer Does Something Smart</h2><p>There are absolutely no guarantees in soccer, and it can be dangerous to treat any sport as if it is little more than an equation.</p><p>Taking a team (Arsenal, say) that seems to lack something specific (a cutting edge, for example) and addressing the problem (by signing a striker) sounds simple. But soccer is a game of second-order effects: That striker might have some unforeseeable, detrimental impact on the shape or the movement of the team. There is no such thing as a sure thing.</p></div></div><div><div><p>It is not, then, predetermined that Mauricio Pochettino will prove to be an inspired hire <a href="https://x.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1823990530428043715" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as coach of the United States men’s national team</a>. Adding an elite manager to a gifted (but incomplete) squad will not automatically mean success. But that should not detract from the fact that it is a profoundly intelligent move for both parties.</p><p>U.S. Soccer gets a coach, most obviously, who has taken charge of three of Europe’s biggest teams, who plays a distinct, identifiable and effective sort of soccer, and who carries the sort of cachet that should inspire encouragement and hope as the country gears up for the 2026 World Cup.</p><p>And Pochettino gets a job which is only upside. It will make him a household name in the United States. It gives him a chance to forge a meaningful, global legacy. Should he do well, he would become an even more appealing appointment for a major European club. And should he fail, he can always do what comes so easily to everyone in soccer, and blame the Americans.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Rory Smith is a global sports correspondent, based in the north of England.
