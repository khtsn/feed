The company went ahead with a lighting ceremony despite concerns from City Hall that the sign might distract passing motorists and pushback from critics who were baffled at the strident political stand of a printing company in a town of 18,000 residents.</p><p>It was worth the trouble, said Anthony Constantino, Sticker Mule’s chief executive.</p><p>“I’m here doing this on behalf of all Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike,” Mr. Constantino, 41, said at the event, flanked by mixed-martial artists and a pair of tangerine Tesla Cybertrucks. This was about celebrating free speech and togetherness, he said, and Mr. Trump was “the unity candidate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If recent polls are any indication, many of Mr. Constantino’s customers are not likely to agree.</p><p>It was the latest example of unusually bold politics in the risk-averse business world, at a time when partisan sentiment seems to be seeping into every facet of American life.</p><p>Companies have long tried to influence policy behind the scenes and, in recent years, some have been accused of “virtue signaling” for supporting causes like the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>But it’s still unusual for companies to give full-throated endorsements, and rarer still for the business to be so far removed from national politics.</p><p>Could it be a savvy business strategy? Research suggests no, but the move is making waves in the once placid world of sticker printing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anthony Constantino, Sticker Mule’s chief executive, said he spent nearly $90,000 of his own money on the 100-foot-wide Trump sign.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cindy Schultz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Sticker Mule first garnered attention for its politics in July, when Mr. Constantino said he sent an email with the subject “Trump 2024” to over four million mailing list subscribers. The email, in response to an assassination attempt on Mr. Trump, urged an end to political violence, before promoting a $4 T-shirt, marked down from $19. “I suggest buying one that shows you support Trump,” he wrote.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Confusion ensued. The online business operates all across the country, and in many international markets.</p><p>“I had to double-check who it was coming from,” said Adam Bredlau, 27, a Seattle resident who said he used to order T-shirts and magnets through the website for his punk band, Jet///Lag. “My initial thought was, Oh, I’m done, I’m not using them anymore,” he said.</p><p>Critics of the letter argued that the company made things worse when it began posting the email addresses of some respondents on social media.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Constantino said the business was respectful of people with different opinions, and that it only exposed users who had sent his team death threats or other harmful messages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The endorsement certainly attracted attention. The company’s website received almost 3.7 million visits in July, up 43 percent from the same month the previous year, according to Similarweb, an analytics company.</p><p>But that hasn’t translated to more sales, Mr. Constantino said. “We took a hit on this, but there’s an upfront investment to solve big problems.”</p><h2 id="link-41a8018d">Purple Politics</h2><p>In Amsterdam, where residents have recently elected candidates from both major parties, political opinions are a calculated risk for businesses. About 38 percent of city voters are Democrats, the biggest voting bloc, but independent and Republican voters are close behind, according to data from the Montgomery County Board of Elections.</p><p>The sign’s unveiling almost didn’t happen. Last week, the office of Mayor Michael Cinquanti, a Democrat, sought a temporary restraining order preventing the massive sign from being displayed, because it was a violation of zoning rules and could pose a hazard to distracted drivers.</p><p>Shortly before the lighting, a lawyer for Sticker Mule convinced a State Supreme Court judge to vacate the order, because it was not properly obtained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Cinquanti said in a statement that the city had informed Mr. Constantino in August that the sign violated city codes, and that he could apply for variances, but there was no follow-up.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Constantino said he had the sign installed because he believed Mr. Trump was “the unity candidate.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cindy Schultz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“If the same exact sign had the name ‘Harris’ instead of ‘Trump,’ our city would be taking the same exact actions to require the owner to comply with those same city’s codes,” he said, adding that the city still intended to make Mr. Constantino comply with the rules.</p><p>The company, which employs over 1,000 local residents, mostly in manufacturing, has many supporters. Founded in 2010, Sticker Mule opened in a former glove factory. Manufacturing, once a leading industry, has greatly diminished in the area. More than a fifth of the city’s population was living in poverty as of 2022, according to Social Explorer, a demographic data company.</p><p>At the sign’s lighting ceremony, hundreds of people filled the factory’s parking lot to hear from guest speakers including Henry Cejudo, a former U.F.C. champion, and Joe Mastroianni, a Conservative Party candidate for the State Assembly. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It’s tacky to cloud business with politics, and Anthony never wanted to do that,” Mr. Mastroianni said in an interview. But beyond the endorsement, he said, the sign reflects a sentiment shared by conservatives, who feel shunned by others for their beliefs.</p><p>“It’s like coming out of the closet — it’s liberating,” he said. “That’s the best analogy.”</p><p>Bill Neiss, a city resident, said he showed up to support local business.</p><p>“Sticker Mule’s a big employer,” he said. “You see all these abandoned buildings? We need industry in this country.”</p><h2 id="link-5172573a">A Risky Stance</h2><p>Mr. Constantino insists that the Trump sign was not motivated by business, but a bid to lower the temperature on political discourse.</p><p>“Most people do the risk-reward calculation and stay quiet,” he said. “The world needs to know there are influential, successful people who support the guy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The price for that support was not insignificant. Mr. Constantino formed a political action committee called Sticker PAC, which paid nearly $90,000 (from Mr. Constantino’s own pockets) for the 100-foot sign, according to public disclosures. The group has also printed more than 27,000 packs of pro-Trump stickers for his supporters, he said.</p><p>The moves have generated a lot of attention for the company. Mr. Trump, responding to an article about the lighting ceremony, wrote “Thank You!” and shared the piece with his 7.8 million followers on Truth Social.</p><p>Mr. Constantino is hopeful that the buzz will boost the company’s imminent launch of a new e-commerce platform that will focus on printing products for small-business owners. “We serve the masses,” he said.</p><p>But the bump could be short lived, said Vanessa Burbano, a professor at Columbia Business School who studies the behavior of businesses in the public realm.</p><p>For companies that make overt political statements, “all of my research suggests there is very little upside,” Dr. Burbano said, adding that people react more negatively when they disagree, but don’t often change their behavior when they’re in agreement with a company’s position.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The politicization of business started to pick up around the 2016 election, she said, and has backfired or produced middling results for a number of companies, like MyPillow, whose chief executive closely aligned with Mr. Trump. Expensify, a business software start-up, drew sharp criticism in 2020 for sending an email in support of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign to its 10 million customers.</p><p>There are signs that much of the business world is once again retreating from politics, she said, which makes Sticker Mule something of an outlier.</p><p>Despite the company’s surge in traffic in July, after the Trump email, visits were down 12 percent in September, compared to the same month last year, according to Similarweb.</p><p>Mr. Constantino, however, was unbothered by the prospect of shrinking visits: “I think in the long run it’s going to elevate the brand.”</p><p>Paul Post<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->Susan C.
