According to a copy obtained by The New York Times, it also asserts that he frequently drank to excess both in public and private, including on one occasion she witnessed when he was wearing his military uniform.</p><p>The allegations, which Mr. Hegseth denied through his lawyer, surfaced as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/hegseth-armed-services-senate.html" title="">Republicans were working to speed him to confirmation</a>, and could imperil that push. About a half-dozen Republicans who have learned of the accusations in recent days have privately raised serious concerns about them, according to people familiar with the conversations.</p><p>Yet just hours after the affidavit was filed, Republican leaders plowed ahead on Tuesday night to schedule a vote on Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation, with several rank-and-file members of the party dismissing the sworn statement as a desperate attempt at character assassination that would fail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, began taking the necessary steps to limit debate and schedule an up-or-down vote within days, effectively closing off any avenue for senators to investigate further. And all Republicans voted to keep the nomination on track.</p><p>Senator Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said he did not expect the new disclosures to threaten Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation, and that the Senate would work into the weekend if necessary to ensure his swift approval. With Democrats expected to oppose Mr. Hegseth en masse on the floor, he can afford to lose only three G.O.P. votes.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
