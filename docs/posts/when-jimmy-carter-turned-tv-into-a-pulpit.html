But it is the truth.” — President Jimmy Carter, July 15, 1979</em></p><p>Since Americans began buying television sets, several commanders in chief have been given the title “TV president”: Richard Nixon, who faced John F. Kennedy in the first televised presidential debate and announced his resignation on air; Ronald Reagan, the former actor and “General Electric Theater” host; and Donald J. Trump, previously of “The Apprentice.”</p><p>Jimmy Carter, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/politics/jimmy-carter-dead.html" title="">died on Sunday at 100</a>, is not one of the first leaders who come to mind in this way. But Mr. Carter was arguably the first president of TV’s full maturity. He served at the peak of the broadcast network monoculture, just before the spread of cable TV in the 1980s began to gradually split the audience into niche camps.</p><p>And he related to TV in a way that captured the 1970s essence of his presidency and his time.</p><p>Arriving post-Nixon and post-Vietnam — when Americans’ trust in authority was at a nadir — Mr. Carter offered a different image of national leadership. His was more approachable, humble, in sync with the dressed-down spirit of the ’70s and in tune with a national mood of soul-searching. He was a “Jimmy,” not a “James.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That down-to-earth image was the anchor of one of the most famous portrayals of the president, by Dan Aykroyd on “Saturday Night Live.” (Mr. Carter was not the first president spoofed on “S.N.L.,” which began during the Ford administration, but he was the first elected during the show’s run.)</p><p>Mr. Aykroyd’s Carter, who spoke with a mellow Southern drawl, was a kind of people’s technocrat, a guidance counselor talking America through a weird phase. One of Mr. Aykroyd’s signature sketches, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-68iTvhWNB0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Ask President Carter,”</a> riffs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/06/archives/transcript-of-questions-and-answers-in-president-carters-callin.html" title="">on an actual radio call-in show that Mr. Carter hosted</a> with Walter Cronkite in 1977. In the sketch, Mr. Aykroyd’s Carter walks a postal employee through a problem with a piece of machinery, then coolly talks down a teenage caller on a bad acid trip: “Just remember, you’re a living organism on this planet, and you’re very safe. You’ve just taken a heavy drug. Now relax, stay inside and listen to some music. Do you have any <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/movies/jimmy-carter-rock-roll-president-review.html" title="">Allman Brothers</a>?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dan Aykroyd as Mr. Carter on “Saturday Night Live” in 1979.

In September 1977, months after his inauguration, ABC premiered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/15/archives/tv-heres-the-kiddiemarket-entry.html" title="">“Carter Country,”</a> a sitcom about a Black New York City police officer taking a job in a small Southern town. “The Dukes of Hazzard” burned rubber into prime time a couple years later, along with “B.J. and the Bear,” the adventures of a rambling truck driver and his chimpanzee, named for the University of Alabama football coach Bear Bryant.</p><p>All these showcases of horsepower, short shorts and bumbling sheriffs — along with the <a href="https://time.com/3944668/dukes-of-hazzard-tv-land-confederate-flag/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">occasional Confederate flag</a> — echoed hit movies of the time like “Convoy” and “Smokey and the Bandit.” Collectively, torn between celebrating their characters and mocking them, they showed the attempt by Hollywood to work through what it thought of the South, even as America had elected a representative of the “New South” who, as governor of Georgia, had hung a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/05/archives/georgia-to-hang-dr-king-portrait-blacks-will-be-honored-for-first.html" title="">portrait of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</a> in the state Capitol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Carter’s actual TV presence was more nuanced than the parodies of him. The president’s interviews with Bill Moyers and Barbara Walters refracted a 1970s introspection through the pastoral voice of a longtime Sunday school teacher. His manner was earnest and thoughtful, but not without political subtext: His campaign, after all, was based on a theme of authenticity, a promise to run a trustworthy and unpretentious government.</p><p>But his most memorable appearance is surely <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?153917-1/president-carter-address-crisis-confidence" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his Malaise speech</a> (so-called, though he never used the word in his text), on July 15, 1979. Over four decades later, the speech remains one of the most astonishing on-air addresses given by a sitting president.</p><p>Structurally, it is not the typical Oval Office speech. In fact, Mr. Carter begins by telling the audience that he had planned to give a different speech, on the energy crisis that was plaguing the American economy and was threatening his ability to govern.</p><p>Instead, he says, he began a sort of journalistic project. He spent 10 days inviting Americans from various walks of life — ordinary workers, politicians, religious leaders — to Camp David, where he asked them: What is getting America down?</p><p>The answers, as he relays them, are not just sobering but chastening. Some citizens describe economic despair; others “a moral and a spiritual crisis,” a problem of not knowing whom to believe or whether to believe in themselves. He cited a Southern governor as telling him: “Mr. President, you’re not leading this nation. You’re just managing the government.”</p><p>A president of the United States was saying this, about himself, on national television! In many ways, the speech played like a commercial produced by his opposition — but was also a manifestation of Mr. Carter’s political brand and of the confessional times he lived in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The deal that Mr. Carter offered supporters was of openness: They would let it all hang out, and so would he. (He was the candidate who, in a campaign interview with Playboy, made the then-scandalous admission that he had felt lust for women other than his wife.) Prefiguring Bill Clinton, he said that Americans had voted for a president “who feels your pain.”</p><p>That, as much as anything, is the message of the speech. His tone is subdued and reflective. He repeatedly looks down, reading off notes on his desk, but also as if to show that he is digesting this information along with his audience. The speech doesn’t quite fit the categories of Oval Office address we are used to — not an announcement or a pep talk or an exhortation for action. It’s an encounter-group session, a confession, a mea culpa, a lament and a round of tough talk.</p><p>But the speech is about more than empathy. It’s a kind of spiritual diagnosis. It both rues and exemplifies the inward turning of the times, manifest in America’s culture of self-help, self-discovery or, in the words of the speech, “self-indulgence.” The president describes a crisis in “confidence” — a word he repeats — and says, “We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives.”</p><p>Toward the end, the address turns into the energy speech that Mr. Carter had first intended to give, offering policy proposals and calls for conservation. But he concludes with a plea to the audience to boost America’s strategic reserves of moral energy.</p><p>“I will do my best, but I will not do it alone,” he says. “Let your voice be heard. Whenever you have a chance, say something good about our country.” The request is almost that of a couples’ therapist giving his clients homework before the next session.</p><p>Electorally, the speech was ultimately a failure. (Though in the short term, despite popular memory, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/16/archives/carter-speech-scores-in-a-midwest-tv-poll-61-percent-feel.html" title="">a hit</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/18/archives/speech-lifts-carter-rating-to-37-public-agrees-on-confidence-crisis.html" title="">boosting his approval rating</a>.) The next November, voters rejected Mr. Carter and elected Mr. Reagan, who offered Americans an airbrushed headshot of themselves rather than a stark mirror.</p><p>As rhetoric, however, the speech survives better than many more tactically successful political addresses. Mr. Carter’s speech is a rare one that can stand as a document of its cultural moment, like Tom Wolfe’s “The Me Decade” or Christopher Lasch’s “The Culture of Narcissism,” also of the 1970s. The speech may not have saved America or the president. But like Mr. Carter himself, the speech aged well in his postpresidency.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>James Poniewozik is the chief TV critic for The Times.
