Last month, President Trump signed an executive order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/stopping-waste-fraud-and-abuse-by-eliminating-information-silos/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling for</a> the “consolidation” of these segregated records, raising the prospect of creating a kind of data trove about Americans that the government has never had before, and that members of the president’s own party have historically opposed.</p><p>The effort is being driven by Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and his lieutenants with the Department of Government Efficiency, who have sought access to dozens of databases as they have swept through agencies across the federal government. Along the way, they have elbowed past the objections of career staff, data security protocols, national security experts and legal privacy protections.</p><p>So far, the Musk group’s success has varied by agency and sometimes by the day, as differing rulings have come down from federal judges hearing more than a dozen lawsuits challenging the moves. The group has been temporarily blocked from sensitive data at several agencies, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/musk-doge-social-security-records.html" title="">Social Security Administration</a>. But on Monday, an appeals court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musks-doge-team-can-access-government-data-now-appeals-court-rules-2025-04-07/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reversed a preliminary injunction</a> barring the group’s access at the Treasury, the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p>And this week, the Internal Revenue Service agreed to help the Department of Homeland Security obtain closely held taxpayer data to help identify immigrants for deportation, over the objections of career employees. In the wake of that decision, the acting I.R.S. commissioner and other top officials are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/irs-ice-tax-data-deal.html" title="">preparing to resign</a>.</p><p>The categories of information shown here are drawn from 23 data systems holding personal information about the public across eight agencies that Mr. Musk’s aides are seeking to access, according to people familiar with their efforts as well as internal documents and court depositions. In all, The New York Times identified more than 300 separate fields of data about people who live in the U.S. contained in these data systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="full-list" data-id="100000010098658" data-source-id="100000010098658"><div slug="full-list" data-sourceid="100000010098658" id="embed-id-100000010098658">

Through his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/stopping-waste-fraud-and-abuse-by-eliminating-information-silos/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">orders</a>, Mr. Trump has sought to grant Mr. Musk’s group access to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“all unclassified agency records”</a> — a category that leaves out national security secrets but that includes personally sensitive information on virtually everyone in America.</p><p>With such data stitched together, Mr. Musk and the White House have said they could better hunt for waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>“The way the government is defrauded is that the computer systems don’t talk to each other,” Mr. Musk said in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370654580112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent Fox News interview</a>. Link the data, he suggested, and the government could identify swindlers who collect aid from one agency when the I.R.S. knows their income is too high or when the Social Security Administration knows their age is too low.</p><p>But critics such as privacy groups, public employee unions and immigrant rights associations who have sued to block the group’s data access warn that so much accumulated information could be used for far more than detecting fraud — and would be illegal.</p><p>This assembled data, they say, would give the government too much power, including potentially to punish critics and police immigrants. It would create a national security vulnerability that could be targeted by hostile nation states. And it would break a longstanding covenant between the federal government and the U.S. public rooted in privacy laws — that Americans who share their personal data with official agencies can trust that it will be secured and used only for narrow purposes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="agencies" data-id="100000010098657" data-source-id="100000010098657"><div slug="agencies" data-sourceid="100000010098657" id="embed-id-100000010098657">

Countries including China, Russia and Iran have been behind major breaches of U.S. government databases in recent years, U.S. officials have said.</p><p>Private companies and data brokers that buy and sell data know plenty about Americans, too. But a crucial difference lies in what the federal government alone can do with that data, privacy advocates say. Google doesn’t control the apparatus of immigration enforcement. Target doesn’t have the power to halt Social Security payments.</p><p>“This gets to a fundamental point about privacy: It is not just the question of, ‘Does anyone else in the world know this about me?’” said John Davisson, the director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which has sued the administration to block DOGE’s access to financial data at the Treasury and federal work force records at the Office of Personnel Management. “It is a question of <em>who</em> knows this about me, and what can they lawfully — or as a practical matter — do with that information?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2f8ac8ab">Privacy over efficiency</h2><p>Congress <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/doge-betrays-foundational-commitments-of-the-privacy-act-of-1974" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debated that question 50 years ago</a> as it considered passing a law to protect the privacy of Americans’ data in the wake of the Watergate scandal and with the growing computerization of personal records.</p><p>“Where will it end?” said the Republican senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona at the time. “Will we permit all computerized systems to interlink nationwide so that every detail of our personal lives can be assembled instantly for use by a single bureaucrat or institution?”</p><p>With the passage of the 1974 Privacy Act, Americans chose privacy over efficiency, said Julian Sanchez, a libertarian privacy scholar.</p><p>“We made a very conscious choice to say we’re accepting the costs of inefficiency,” he said, “because if a unified database came into the hands of someone who wanted to put state power to some repressive purpose, their task would be made too easy by that centralization.”</p><p>At times, he said, libertarians have been called paranoid for suggesting such a scenario was still realistic in America in the 21st century.</p><p>“I think it’s very evident,” he said, “now it is.”</p><p>In Mr. Trump’s March 20 executive order, he called for <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/stopping-waste-fraud-and-abuse-by-eliminating-information-silos/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“eliminating information silos”</a> across the government. Within 30 days, the order states, “agency heads shall, to the maximum extent consistent with law, rescind or modify all agency guidance that serves as a barrier to the inter- or intra-agency sharing of unclassified information.” The administration has not specified who would be able to view data that gets consolidated across the government, but the order broadly grants wide-ranging access to federal officials “designated by the president or agency heads.”</p><p>The president also is targeting information held by states, seeking “unfettered access to comprehensive data” related to programs that receive federal funding.</p><p>The White House did not respond to the concerns raised by critics about the risks of pulling these data streams together.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-10"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The federal student aid application asks about your income and assets, as well as those of your parents and spouse.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">studentaid.gov</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>This I.R.S. tax return form asks about your dependents and the bank account where any deposits are refunded.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">irs.gov</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It remains to be seen whether the courts will ultimately permit the administration’s efforts, some of which appear to run counter to the Privacy Act and other laws.</p><p>The Privacy Act prohibits agencies from disclosing personal information without your consent. Agencies also generally aren’t supposed to share data across the government for a purpose unrelated to why it was originally collected.</p><p>That means, for example, that the government shouldn’t use personal data you handed over to apply for student loans to later carry out immigration enforcement against your parents. Or use information you filed to itemize your tax deductions to later identify you as a supporter of left-leaning causes.</p><p>“The government is not necessarily supposed to be thinking creatively about how it can combine all of the information that it has ever collected about you and your family across dozens of databases over the course of your entire life to find out new things about you,” said Aman George, the legal policy director with Democracy Forward, a liberal-leaning legal group that has brought some of the lawsuits against DOGE.</p><p>There are some exceptions to legal privacy standards, including for criminal investigations and for government employees who need restricted data to do their lawfully assigned jobs.

However, Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/fact-check-elon-musk-government-spending-fraud-claims.html" title="">has shown little interest in the details</a> of those explanations.

Will they act first and deal with the fallout later?” said Elizabeth Laird with the Center for Democracy and Technology. “People who maybe are like, ‘Well, I got notified my data was breached 10 years ago and I’ve been fine’ — I don’t think they’ve been subjected to what we may see this used for.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>About this project</strong></p><p>To identify the data variables shown here, The Times compiled a list of data systems DOGE has sought to access, relying on reporting and legal documents. For each data system, we then gathered the data collection elements listed in Privacy Impact Assessments or System of Records Notices required by law. Where that information was vague (for example your “tax records”), we relied on other documentation to compile more specific data fields (like the line items on a 1040 individual income tax return). In some cases, DOGE has sought access to data retrieval systems and data warehouses that pull information from many separate systems. In such cases, we tried to identify information in those interconnected systems, too.</p><p>While we identified about 80 data systems in total that have been targeted by DOGE, this analysis illustrates only those that contain personal information about the American public. We excluded data systems that hold personal information only on federal employees; those that contain primarily information about businesses and institutions; and those that manage internal processes, like setting up emails and sending out invoices. Our definition of the American public includes many smaller subpopulations, like anyone who has ever applied for a federal job, a student loan, a research grant or unemployment benefits. Data collected about those groups (for example, the college you attended if you had a student loan) may not be known by the government about everyone in America.</p><p>Nicholas Nehamas<!-- -->, <!-- -->Debra Kamin<!-- -->, <!-- -->Andrew Duehren<!-- -->, <!-- -->Alan Rappeport<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aaron Krolik<!-- -->, <!-- -->Zach Montague<!-- -->, <!-- -->Rebecca Davis O’Brien<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ryan Mac<!-- --> contributed reporting; <!-- -->Ethan Singer<!-- -->, <!-- -->Alicia Parlapiano<!-- --> and <!-- -->Larry Buchanan<!-- --> contributed production.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Badger writes about cities and urban policy for The Times from Washington.
