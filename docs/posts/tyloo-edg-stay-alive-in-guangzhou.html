</span> 2-1.</p>



<p>Previously, Trace commanded the head-to-head record between the two teams 4-1. But TYLOO had risen through the regional ranks while Trace declined over the course of the 2025 season, leading to TYLOO winning their most recent encounter last year.  </p>

<p>The series opened on TYLOO&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598946/tyloo-vs-trace-esports-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr3/?game=245277&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>, which was a classic Neon-Viper mirror match. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3049/sword9">
		sword9	</a>
</span> led TYLOO to an early 6-0 lead as the Sova player collected 12 kills in six rounds. TYLOO constantly found their way onto sites as the attackers, winning nine out of 10 postplants for a 9-3 lead at the half.</p>

<p>A pistol and a bonus for TYLOO gave them a staggering 12-3 lead. Trace pulled it back somewhat with fast site hits, but with such a slim margin for error, a 4K from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/39485/scales">
		Scales	</a>
</span> eventually sealed the map 13-7. </p>

<p><em>Scales finds four to put an end to Haven.</em></p>

<p>Trace took the second map to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598946/tyloo-vs-trace-esports-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr3/?game=245278&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>. Both teams fielded Waylay and Yoru but shied away from double-Controller, as Trace went for Sova and Breach and TYLOO went for a Veto pick. </p>

<p>The entire map was a tight race. In the first half, TYLOO held a slight 7-5 lead primarily off the back of entries and multikills from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36685/splash">
		splash	</a>
</span> on Waylay, but Trace answered back once they had built up their ultimates, using them in tandem to coordinate overwhelming retakes.</p>

<p><em>splash opens and closes the round with a 4K.</em></p>

<p>Trace took a solid lead into the second half with a pistol and bonus, stringing together six rounds in a row to open up an 11-7 lead and then 12-9. Pushed to the edge, the members of TYLOO came alive, with <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/55085/erv">
		Erv	</a>
</span> and Scales putting together multikills to force overtime.</p>

<p>TYLOO&#39;s coaching staff chose to take a timeout before the overtime rounds began, and that decision paid off. <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/41739/slowly">
		slowly	</a>
</span> found an Operator double kill in the final round after a quiet map of mainly rifling to win the map 14-12. splash finished the map and series at the top of the standings, picking up 27 of his 44 total kills and six of his eight total first kills on Abyss. </p>

</span>, while JDG sought to carry on their run through the lower bracket. EDG ultimately maintained their supremacy over JDG with a 2-1 victory, as the main EDG roster continues to be undefeated against the now-eliminated JDG.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598947/edward-gaming-vs-jdg-esports-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr3/?game=245280&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a> was the first map, with both teams continuing to opt into their own double-Duelist looks. EDG had a strong 5-1 start on their attack, but <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/16924/stew">
		stew	</a>
</span> made an impact on Waylay in the last two rounds of the half as JDG fought back to a close 7-5 that slightly favored EDG. </p>

<p>The second half was anything but close. After losing a second pistol round, JDG were unable to get anything going on their own attack, running headlong into EDG&#39;s defensive setups as EDG ran away to a 13-6 victory. <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/39697/cb">
		cb	</a>
</span> in particular posed major problems for his opponents as he put up 21 kills and 300 ACS in the map.</p>

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/49476/zhe">
		zhe	</a>
</span> and stew ran rampant, with the former finding constant early picks with scoped weapons and rifles and the latter running rings around EDG with multikills as Neon. A 9-3 half plus a second pistol round proved too much for EDG to come back from as JDG won the map 13-6. zhe and stew ended with 20 and 17 kills respectively, while <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3519/jkuro">
		jkuro	</a>

<p><em>stew runs it down A Long and mows down EDG.</em></p>

<p>However, it was the two other members of the team, <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> on Astra and <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span> on Fade, who stood out the most. nobody won his side early momentum with a 1v3 clutch in the round two eco, while Smoggy on was a killing machine, racking up 27 kills and 402 ACS in a 13-5 stomp to win EDG the series.</p>

<p>A gauntlet still awaits TYLOO and EDG if they hope to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a>, starting with one another; the two squads will return <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598948/tyloo-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr4" target="_blank">tomorrow</a>, February 6 for the next lower bracket round, each needing three consecutive wins in the span of four days to make it to the global stage.</p>
