But the turn still serves as a reminder that many corporate leaders see their highest priority as reading the room — one that Trump now dominates.</p><p><strong>Mark Zuckerberg has been moving in this direction for some time.</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/business/meta-fact-checking/zuckerberg-is-preparing-for-the-second-trump-presidency-differently-than-he-did-for-the-first" title="">In relation to the 2016 election</a>, the Meta chief, who has a history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/business/meta-fact-checking/mark-zuckerbergs-history-of-moving-meta-toward-where-the-political-wind-blows" title="">tacking where political winds blow</a>, followed other tech companies in partnering with fact-checking groups to police content on its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. Since then, however, the tech mogul has fumed as Meta was criticized for both failing to do enough — and for removing too many user posts.</p><p>“It’s time to get back to our roots around free expression,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcing the changes, including a move to X-style user-policing known as Community Notes. (Katie Harbath, a former communications executive at Meta, told The Times, “This is an evolved return to his political origins.”)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>The changes aren’t necessarily as big as they first appeared.</strong> Politico noted that Meta had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/07/is-zuckerberg-kneeling-to-trump-00196991" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been paring back</a> its moderation efforts in recent years. And while Zuckerberg promoted plans to move such workers to Texas to “eliminate bias,” many such workers are already based there.</p><p>Zuckerberg isn’t alone: Tech companies <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/social-media-companies-decide-content-moderation-is-trending-down-25380d25" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">haven’t ever wanted</a> to be in the business of moderating user content. Last summer, <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/youtubes-testing-own-version-community-notes/719190/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube began testing</a> a version of Community Notes, though it was described as more of a supplemental feature.</p><p><strong>Is the political payoff for Meta worth the criticism?</strong> Trump, who had railed against the company’s moves to police his content — including briefly shutting down his Facebook account after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol — said the tech giant had “come a long way.” (He also said his threats against Zuckerberg “probably” contributed to the new policy.)</p><p>Meta executives may hope that, along with the elevation of the longtime Republican executive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/technology/meta-joel-kaplan-nick-clegg.html" title="">Joel Kaplan</a> to lead global affairs, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/meta-trump-inaugural-fund-donation.html" title="">$1 million donation</a> to the Trump inaugural fund and the addition of the Trump ally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/technology/dana-white-meta-board-ufc.html" title="">Dana White</a> to its board, may get them into the president-elect’s good graces.</p><p>A factor worth watching: Zuckerberg said he would work with Trump to “<a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DEhgbcvpYor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">push back against foreign governments</a> going after American companies to censor more.” That was a thinly veiled shot against the European Union, which has sought to punish companies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/business/meta-fact-checking/f372f55b-0ba8-5bb3-8d18-0d42ce386314" title="">including Meta</a>, for insufficiently policing their platforms — and may increase its scrutiny of the tech giant after Tuesday’s move.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Will the move work?</strong> So far, advertisers aren’t publicly objecting. And Tuesday’s news most likely allays concerns that Trump regulatory picks, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/r/23d45fdd?m=0b500f22-d915-4b8b-8a3a-ec6e40842dbd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including Brendan Carr</a> of the Federal Communications Commission, had about Meta.</p><p>But <a href="https://x.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/1876664103114350765" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Senator Marsha Blackburn</a>, Republican of Tennessee, wrote on X that Meta’s change was simply “a ploy to avoid being regulated.” She added, “We will not be fooled.”</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>Wildfires near Los Angeles force widespread evacuations. </strong>Parts of Santa Monica and the Pacific Palisades were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/08/us/california-wildfire-la-palisades" title="">hit by a blaze</a> that destroyed homes and forced at least 30,000 to flee for safety. Another fire, near Pasadena, was also causing issues as officials warned of devastating losses.</p><p><strong>Anthropic is close to raising billions more in capital.</strong> The artificial intelligence start-up is in advanced talks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/technology/anthropic-ai-funding.html" title="">collect $2 billion</a> in a round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, The Times reports. If completed, the fund-raising would value Anthropic at $60 billion — roughly three times as much as it was worth a year ago — in another sign that the deal making frenzy around A.I. shows no signs of slowing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase reportedly plans to call employees back to the office five days a week. </strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/jpmorgan-planning-to-bring-staff-back-to-office-five-days-a-week" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">That’s up</a> from the requirement of three days a week, according to Bloomberg, though about 60 percent of Wall Street giant’s staff is already at the office full time. Other major companies have already reduced or eliminated work-from-home policies instituted during the coronavirus pandemic; JPMorgan’s C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, has long criticized hybrid working arrangements.</p><h2 id="link-b2405ab">The markets are taking Trump seriously </h2><p>Coming into 2025, the big questions hanging over President-elect Donald Trump’s second term included tax cuts, the Fed’s independence and potential new trade war.</p><p>But few could have foreseen the president-elect refusing to rule out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/trump-panama-canal-greenland.html" title="">military force or economic coercion</a> against allies as he did on Tuesday at a wide-ranging news conference at Mar-a-Lago. It underscores that for markets, a Trump presidency brings plenty of potential black swan events.</p><p><strong>A recap: </strong>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/panama-greenland-trump-media.html" title="">revealed an expansive vision</a> of “America First,” doubling down on calls for the United States to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. And he spoke of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America,” though it was unclear how serious he was about that.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>The Trump effect can be seen in the markets on Wednesday.</strong> The S&amp;P 500 looks set to open lower, and sectors like <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3O40EN:0-european-wind-energy-stocks-fall-after-trump-turbine-commentary/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">green energy</a> and companies including Tesla slumped after Trump railed on Tuesday about <a href="https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ORSTED-A-S-28607554/news/European-wind-energy-companies-fall-on-Trump-s-call-for-a-halt-to-expansion-update-48703914/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wind turbines</a> and grumbled about electric vehicles.</p><p>And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a roughly nine-month high on Tuesday, a worrying sign <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/mortgage-rates-hit-highest-level-since-july-crushing-application-demand.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for house hunters</a> and credit-card holders.</p><p><strong>Some market watchers still believe that markets could check the Trump agenda.</strong> Bond vigilantes could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/business/dealbook/trump-economy-bonds.html" title="">act as a brake</a> on Trump’s policies if they reignite inflation.</p><p>And more broadly, the Trump team cares “about the verdict of financial markets,” Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, wrote in a research note on Wednesday. “If their actions were to impair the potential for growth and corporate earnings badly enough to trigger a sell-off, they might change tack.”</p><p><strong>There are signs that might prove true. </strong>Trump acknowledged on Tuesday that it would be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/07/trump-press-conference-greenland-oil-middle-east-takeaways-00196901" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“hard” to bring down consumer prices</a>, a major shift from what he told supporters on the campaign trail. His big inflation-fighting idea, expanding oil drilling, hasn’t yet affected the markets, with crude oil prices on a steady rise in recent weeks. (President Biden’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/climate/biden-oil-gas-drilling-ban.html" title="">ban on new oil exploration</a> in vast stretches of U.S. waters has contributed to that price surge, and may be hard for Trump to undo.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>That said, the VIX volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has been stable for weeks, a sign that equity investors are still bullish.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-7a914eeb">Trump’s record-breaking inauguration </h2><p>Donald Trump’s transition team has already amassed a mega budget to throw an inauguration bash for the ages.</p><p>And the president-elect can thank the giants of the tech industry and Wall Street — some of the same figures who’ve met with him recently at Mar-a-Lago — for the record haul of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/us/politics/trump-inaugural-donations.html" title="">at least $150 million</a>. Few federal rules govern how Trump and his associates can spend the money.</p><p><strong>Donors who have gone public include</strong>: Amazon, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Meta and Uber. Executives such as Tim Cook of Apple, Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber and Sam Altman of OpenAI have also chipped in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Contributing to inauguration funds has become a corporate America tradition. </strong>“You’re giving money directly to the incoming president with no risk of backing the wrong horse,” Craig Holman, a lobbyist with Public Citizen, a consumer rights watchdog, told DealBook’s Sarah Kessler. Donors who give $1 million to the fund <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/us/politics/trump-donors-inauguration-access.html" title="">receive tickets to the inauguration plus other events</a> such as a reception with cabinet picks and a pre-inauguration dinner with Trump.</p><p><strong>There are only a few restrictions.</strong> Foreign nationals are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/us/politics/imaad-zuberi-sentence.html" title="">not allowed to donate</a>, and donations over $200 must be disclosed. And anti-bribery laws apply. “Beyond that, it’s pretty much open in terms of who may contribute and how they may spend it,” said Kenneth Gross, a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at Akin Gump.</p><p>The inauguration fund pays for the parties, dinners and the parade, while taxpayers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/trump-who-pays-for-inauguration-cost.html" title="">foot the bill for security and the swearing-in ceremony.</a></p><p><strong>What will happen to unspent funds? </strong>Two people involved in the fund-raising for Trump’s inauguration told The Times that donors expected the remaining money to go to Trump’s presidential library. </p><p>The last time, Trump’s team raised $107 million (the previous record). It was later revealed that a nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/trumps-inaugural-committee-paid-26-million-to-first-ladys-friend.html" title="">$26 million payment</a> went to an event planning firm created by an adviser to the first lady, Melania Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Lawmakers have sought to change things. </strong>One bill <a href="https://scanlon.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=600" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced in 2023</a> would limit contributions to $50,000. But such efforts have gained little traction.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-254d1d6b">The big new corporate bet: Bitcoin</h2><p>Corporate treasury departments are usually bastions of caution, preferring to invest their companies’ money in stable assets like Treasury bonds. But a growing number are choosing to go a different route by investing in crypto.</p><p>By one estimate, more than 70 publicly traded companies have invested in Bitcoin, despite some having nothing to do with crypto. At least a few have been inspired by MicroStrategy, a software company that began amassing Bitcoin in 2020 — and now sits on a stockpile worth over $40 billion. MicroStrategy’s stock price is up roughly tenfold over the past 18 months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>But it means that those companies are putting their money <a href="https://nytimes.com/2025/01/08/business/bitcoin-crypto-company-treasury.html" title="">in a highly volatile asset</a> that could imperil their finances if things go wrong, The Times’s David Yaffe-Bellany and Joe Rennison write:</p><blockquote><p>The investments are a sharp pivot away from the cautious approach of the traditional corporate treasury department, whose focus is typically safeguarding cash rather than risking it for a higher return. Typical reserve assets include steady, predictable securities like U.S. government bonds and money market funds.</p><p>“I cannot understand how a risk-averse board could justify an investment in digital assets, given we know they swing quite significantly,” said Naresh Agarwal, an associate director at the Association of Corporate Treasurers, a trade organization. “It is quite an opaque market.”</p></blockquote><p>Some investors aren’t on board with this new tactic. When Banzai, a publicly traded marketing firm, decided to invest in Bitcoin, some shareholders expressed alarm. Joe Davy, its C.E.O., told The Times: “I got a couple of phone calls from people who were like: ‘What the hell is going on over there? What are you thinking?’”</p><h3 id="link-7c091e00"><span>THE SPEED READ </span></h3><p><strong>Deals</strong></p><ul><li><p>Tencent <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-makes-biggest-buyback-since-014242667.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bought back nearly eight million shares</a> over the past two days to shore up its stock price, after the Chinese tech giant was placed on a U.S. military blacklist.
