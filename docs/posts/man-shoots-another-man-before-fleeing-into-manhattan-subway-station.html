The victim, who is 47, was struck in the leg and shoulder and was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was in stable condition.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether the two men knew each other or what the gunman’s motive was. The police said they did not have anyone in custody and that the shooting was still under investigation.</p><p>The shooting was a manifestation of some of New Yorkers’ fears and frustrations about safety on the city’s subterranean transit system. As the police searched for the gunman, riders throughout the trains were told to get down and shelter in place without being fully aware of what was happening around them. Some New Yorkers reported being stuck on trains for more than an hour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>C train service was suspended in both directions after the shooting, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, before resuming with delays, and there were other delays reported throughout the system.</p><p>A New York Times reporter was on a southbound C train that was stopped between 81st and 72nd Streets. The train’s conductor told riders to get on the ground and keep their heads down.</p><p>The conductor announced at around 9:50 a.m. that there was a police investigation at the 72nd Street station, which serves the B and C train lines. Within minutes, two officers boarded the first car of the train as they searched for the gunman.</p><p>As the passengers laid on the floor, police officers walked through the tracks outside, at times flashing their lights into the car. At one point, the conductor tried to reassure the riders, telling them that the gunman was not near their train car.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Police officers stand on the stairs in a subway station talking to other people." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f1760804-89f1-5319-b968-e1fccd934d4b" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers at the 72nd Street station after the shooting.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hurubie Meko/ The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>At around 10:10 a.m., the police — in special operations gear — began evacuating the C train, as well as other nearby trains, and leading riders through the tracks.
