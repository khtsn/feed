Appearing on “All the Smoke” could help her reach more Black men, a base that has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/politics/donald-trump-hiphop.html" title="">increasingly courted</a> by former President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/us/politics/2024-election-gop-black-men-voters.html" title="">Donald J. Trump</a>.</p><p><em>“</em>In previous times, someone would have gone to a Black barbershop or a soul food restaurant,” said Todd Boyd, a race and pop culture scholar and professor at the University of Southern California. “But these days, certain podcasts appeal to certain audience members.”</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/3R3KIyEgCgc?si=8Tq_l1NfwvRkDgSF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/8csIeO-pYL8?si=9fbf2EH-n83Rfuhr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/NEUkWd8KppQ?si=x0sH_PJcg3SrJe67" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Will Smith</a> have all been interviewed on “All the Smoke,” which began in 2019 and has more than one million YouTube subscribers. “All the Smoke,” which has become one of the more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/magazine/professional-athlete-podcast.html" title="">recognizable athlete-led podcasts</a> in a saturated marketplace, typically brings on guests from sports and entertainment to discuss topics in those areas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The show’s hosts, Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, spent portions of their long N.B.A. careers with the Golden State Warriors while Ms. Harris was the district attorney of San Francisco. The vice president, who was born in Oakland, where the Warriors played for 47 seasons, has been a vocal fan of the team, and Coach Steve Kerr <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/steve-kerr-kamala-harris-dnc.html" title="">endorsed her at the Democratic National Convention</a>.</p><p>“To step into this political realm and understand the importance and how some people are either all the way in it or all the way out of it, I’m really interested to see what our fans have to say<em>,”</em> Mr. Barnes said in an interview with The New York Times.</p><p>Mr. Barnes said Chris Holliday, <a href="https://www.complex.com/sneakers/a/jacques-slade/chris-holliday-sneakers-politics-obama-kamala-interview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a political adviser and strategist</a> he met at a pickup basketball game in 2017, approached him last week about interviewing Ms. Harris. He said “All the Smoke” sent the candidate’s team a list of discussion topics before the hosts spoke with Ms. Harris at her Washington home.</p><p>To prepare for the interview, Mr. Barnes did research online and watched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/kamala-harris-oprah-winfrey-event.html" title="">Ms. Harris’s recent conversation with Oprah Winfrey</a>. The hosts chose topics they felt would be most applicable to their listeners and viewers, he said, skipping the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to focus on areas like the economy and historically Black colleges and universities. Mr. Jackson was a vocal activist during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 after the Minneapolis police <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/sports/basketball/stephen-jackson-george-floyd-protests.html" title="">killed his longtime friend George Floyd</a>.</p><p>They also tried to find areas of common interest with Ms. Harris, Mr. Barnes said, noting that he and the vice president are both biracial. To keep the show lighthearted and jovial, it was important to make her laugh and feel comfortable, Mr. Barnes said, so the first question was about the blind date where she met her husband, Douglas Emhoff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I think it’s the opportunity for our fans to get a chance to know her as a person. It wasn’t a huge policy-driven thing — it was more just getting a chance to know the woman.”</p><p>Mr. Barnes said that he had always wanted to interview former President Barack Obama and that he would be open to interviewing Mr. Trump, even though he disagrees with things he has said. “All the Smoke” would assess future political guests on a case-by-case basis, said Mr. Barnes, who is excited to get feedback on the conversation with Ms. Harris.</p><p>“There are a lot of people who don’t like to mix sports and politics,” he said. “I am someone who doesn’t mind mixing it, but I also have to understand what our audience wants.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Emmanuel Morgan reports on sports, pop culture and entertainment.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emmanuel-morgan">More about Emmanuel Morgan</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/golden-state-warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The State of Podcasting</h2><hr/><ul><li><p>For hosts of chat podcasts, a growing genre, chemistry — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/arts/podcast-chemistry-handsome-critics-at-large.html">that intangible spark shared among two or more people</a> — has become an invaluable resource.</p></li><li><p>After 12 years, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/style/longform-podcast-says-goodbye.html">hosts of “Longform” will soon release its final episode</a>, capping a podcast that unwittingly captured the shifts in the journalism and publishing industries.</p></li><li><p>“Women Talkin’ ’Bout Murder,” a loving parody of the true-crime genre, is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/arts/amy-poehler-podcast-murder.html">latest satirical podcast from Amy Poehler and her improv friends</a>.</p></li><li><p>As consumers spend more time on video platforms like YouTube, many podcast creators are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/arts/podcasts-video-youtube-audio.html">reimagining their work to be seen as well as heard</a>.</p></li><li><p>The cast of the Nickelodeon series “Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide” are among the stars of 2000s teen sitcoms who are using podcasts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/arts/television/nickelodeon-disney-podcasts-neds-declassified.html">connect with their Gen Z and millennial fan bases</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
