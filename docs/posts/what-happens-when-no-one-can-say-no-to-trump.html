    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>What Happens When No One Can Say No to Trump?</h2><h4>After the capture of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, over the weekend, “Trump is setting a new course for the country where he can use the military to do just about anything he wants,” argues Times Opinion’s editor, Kathleen Kingsbury. “No one is allowed to say ‘no’ to Trump.”</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>It’s only the first full week of the year, and a lot has happened. “The U.S. military has seized the Venezuela-linked oil tanker.” “An ICE agent shot and killed a woman.” “The Trump administration claims the deadly attack was nothing more than a peaceful protest.” Here’s one thing you shouldn’t miss. By now, you’ve seen that President Trump sent U.S. commandos into Venezuela to arrest and depose its president, Nicolás Maduro. The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. So usually, a president has to convince lawmakers that an act of war is worth the extraordinary cost and risk to the United States. But on Monday, one of Trump’s top advisers said the quiet part out loud. “We live in a world that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” Instead of persuasion, strategy and, you know, following the law, Trump is setting a new course for the country where he can use the military to do just about anything he wants, and he certainly won’t stop with Venezuela. That’s why, after spending the weekend capturing a foreign leader, Trump woke up on Monday and asked his advisers for an updated plan to acquire Greenland, the territory of a sovereign NATO ally. “Using the U.S. military is always an option, calling it a national security priority.” And it’s why his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is going after Senator Mark Kelly for saying that military troops should refuse to obey illegal orders. These things all convey one message. No one is allowed to say “no” to Trump. Foreign adversaries can’t say “no.” Allies can’t say “no.” The military can’t say “no,” even if Trump asks them  to violate the law. And don’t forget, all of this is possible because Trump taught Congress they can’t say “no” to him, either. Trump has surrounded himself with yes-men, and they’re betting big on the idea that might equals right. In 2026, we’ll have to see if anyone is willing to prove them wrong.</p></dd></dl></div></div>
