    <h1>It’s Easy to See What Drove Jonathan Holloway to Quit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Last week <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/president/about-president-holloway" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan Holloway,</a> the president of Rutgers University, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/us/rutgers-president-resignation-jonathan-holloway.html" title="">announced</a> he would be stepping down at the end of this academic year — the latest in a series of university president departures.</p><p>Given the widespread discord and protests on campuses, the past academic year was tough for any college president. But unlike others who left their posts, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/09/us/university-of-pennsylvania-president-resigns.html" title="">Liz Magill</a> of the University of Pennsylvania and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/us/harvard-claudine-gay-resigns.html" title="">Claudine Gay</a> of Harvard, Holloway isn’t leaving the kind of elite institution that tends to attract outraged headlines and ire. Nor was he resigning in a heated moment of backlash or scandal.</p><p>So why did he do it?</p><p>“It’s a punishing job in normal times,” Holloway, a scholar of <a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/african-american-studies/afam-162" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">African American history</a>, told me when I spoke to him last week. “But the standards we’re being held to are impossible. I had to ask myself, ‘What is it I want to do, how can I do it, and is this the right position?’”</p><p>Holloway, who previously served as a dean at Yale and a provost at Northwestern, said he struggled with how to balance the role of a college president today, which demands quick responses, with what he described as his own values — listening to people, carefully weighing potential actions and having the freedom to speak his mind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The pressures on university leadership currently make delivering on those propositions extremely trying: The politics of accusation and the world of social media are seemingly out to wreak havoc. Problems don’t have clear solutions but need decisions anyway. Universities can’t respond at the pace of a tweet. You need time to determine facts and consult with many constituencies, especially at a massive state operation like <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/about/by-the-numbers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rutgers</a>, which employs nearly 30,000 people and serves 67,620 students.</p><p>That’s all par for the course. But Holloway faced a hellish series of unfortunate events. His tenure began during the crisis of Covid and, after only a year’s respite, endured a protracted union conflict with university workers that ended with an intervention by Gov. Phil Murphy.</p><p>During that strike, a number of prominent Rutgers faculty members and scholars from other institutions signed <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Scholars-Open-Letter-to-Jonathan-Holloway.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an open letter</a> calling on Holloway to allow for greater bargaining power for the union, which was <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/04/10/striking-rutgers-educators-say-they-are-fighting-for-basic-needs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling</a> for larger pay increases for full-time faculty, adjuncts and graduate student teachers. Last September, the university Senate issued a vote of <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2023/09/25/rutgers-senate-says-its-lost-confidence-president" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no confidence</a>. At one point during the strike, <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2024/09/exclusive-rutgers-president-holloway-says-toxic-politics-drove-decision-to-leave-moran.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">protesters</a> planted themselves outside his home at 7:30 a.m. Campus police officers informed him that he would have 24-hour security at his house until they felt his safety was no longer at risk. From that point on, he had a security escort when he traveled. Holloway decided not to look at the online threats. “The stuff that people say online, the bravado when they’re not in person — if it gets to your personal email, it’s hard to unsee those things.”</p><p>“I thought I couldn’t possibly have had a harder year than that one,” Holloway said. “Joke was on me.”</p><p>Then came Oct. 7. In April, students protesting Israel’s war in Gaza set up an <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/04/29/rutgers-students-launch-pro-palestinian-solidarity-encampment-to-protest-gaza-war/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encampment</a> on the school’s main campus. Holloway eventually came to <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/chancellor/communications/community-engagement-following-student-protests" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an agreement</a> with the protesters that included neither divestment from Israel nor severing its ties with Tel Aviv University but pledged to investigate proposals such as the establishment of a cultural center for Palestinian and other Arab American students. Nonetheless, <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2024/05/after-rutgers-protests-cheap-shots-at-president-holloway-moran.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republicans in Congress</a> attacked him for, in the words of Representative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n43JkyerWY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Virginia Foxx</a>, having “made shocking concessions to the unlawful antisemitic encampments.” Murphy <a href="https://www.roi-nj.com/2024/05/07/politics/murphy-offers-criticism-of-rutgers-laments-missed-opportunities-with-protests/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused Rutgers</a> of overlooking the needs of Jewish students.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I had hard choices to make at Yale and Northwestern, too, but people there knew who I was as a person, and it’s hard to be nasty when you’re up close and live,” Holloway said. “I didn’t have an appreciation for the fact that at a place this big, the president is an abstraction, and once someone is an abstraction, you can say anything you want about that person. It’s exhausting.”</p><p>Everything Holloway told me made sense. Yet I was still surprised by the news, which I heard while participating in a program at the University of Toronto devoted to improving civil discourse. Only a year earlier, I heard him speak at a similar conference, on a panel dedicated to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXKp3eHagyY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">universities and civic culture</a>.</p><p>There he described an episode in which he’d received over 10,000 emails — what he called “cut and paste” activism — protesting a seminar that was planned at least nine months earlier, the last session of which featured scholars of Palestinian liberation struggles. The demand was for him to cancel the seminar. Holloway discussed the situation with calm and deliberation, citing the need to air views that some might find repugnant, the importance of listening and the standards of academic freedom. He seemed genuinely committed to those values.</p><p>In other words, Holloway demonstrated that he is just the kind of conscientious, intentional leader universities need. A member of <a href="https://citizensandscholars.org/focus-areas/enable/college-presidents-for-civic-preparedness/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">College Presidents for Civic Preparedness</a>, he <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/rutgers-president-continues-course-engaged-citizenship" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taught a class</a> at Rutgers on engaged citizenship.</p><p>His goal, he told me, is to challenge students to be critical thinkers in an era of righteousness, an atmosphere in which people have stopped considering whether someone else may be right.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“People will make claim to you: ‘You’re supposed to be here to protect us.’ And I want to say, ‘I <em>am</em>. <em>This</em> is the way I’m trying to protect you.’ But it’s hard to make that argument in an emotional moment.”</p><p>If any university president could handle this heated moment, I figured Holloway would be the one.</p><p>He’d already been through the wringer. In 2015 he was the dean of Yale College during a then infamous, now nearly forgotten scandal over what was considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/us/yale-lecturer-resigns-after-email-on-halloween-costumes.html" title="">cultural appropriation</a> when it came to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/the-new-intolerance-of-student-activism-at-yale/414810/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Halloween costumes</a>. As the first Black dean of Yale College, Holloway, whose appointment to the position had been met with jubilation, walked a fine line. He <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/11/05/students-confront-christakis-about-halloween-email/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spent hours</a> listening to angry, chanting students on the green — mostly in silence, taking notes — many of whom felt their experiences and needs as minority students had been overlooked. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/05/a-confrontation-over-race-at-yale-hundreds-of-students-demand-answers-from-the-schools-first-black-dean/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to</a> The Washington Post, at times he appeared to be choking back tears.</p><p>This past July, Holloway retreated with his family to a house he recently bought in Vermont, a place he envisioned for his eventual retirement. He thought long and hard about what had become a serious strain on his physical health, his emotional well-being and his family life. He tried to figure out how much “gas there was in the tank,” he said.</p><p>At first, he thought he might simply have had bad luck — Covid, strikes, protests. But the problem was bigger than that. The atmosphere on campus, he realized, has fundamentally changed in discouraging ways. The culture of curiosity, the culture of empathy seemed to have gone. He no longer felt he could function to the best of his abilities as a leader in this charged university environment. He didn’t feel he could do the job and stay true to himself.</p><p>“One of my strengths is empathy, and I think it’s made me a very effective administrator, and I’m proud of those elements, but it comes at an incredible cost,” Holloway said. “I don’t want to change who I am. It’s gotten me to this point. If I were to change and become hardhearted, I wouldn’t want to be that person.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>If American universities continue to lose leaders like Jonathan Holloway, higher education is in even greater trouble than it already was.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Pamela Paul is an Opinion columnist at The Times, writing about culture, politics, ideas and the way we live now. <span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
