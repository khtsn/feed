In India, it owns ports, power plants, mines, airports and even a TV station. The conglomerate is one of the country’s most valuable enterprises. Its ability to build, finance and operate highly visible infrastructure projects has made Adani an icon of corporate India as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to expand its place on the global stage.</p><p>In the process, Mr. Adani became one of the richest people in the world. His brand spread, as few Indian companies have ever managed, to encompass deals in Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That is all now at risk of unraveling.</p><p>On Nov. 20, federal prosecutors in New York’s Eastern District accused Mr. Adani of conspiracy to commit bribery and defraud investors, part of a sweeping indictment that took aim at several of his close lieutenants and family members. The prosecutors said that Mr. Adani and his associates offered $265 million to Indian officials to secure solar project contracts, then lied about the bribery scheme to Wall Street.</p><p>The Adani Group said the charges were “baseless” and that it would defend itself legally.</p><p>The shock waves from the indictment are still bouncing between India’s stock markets, foreign investors and the governments of countries that do business with the Adani Group. The group’s relations with international partners are under increasing strain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Security officials watching a protest last month in New Delhi against Gautam Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manish Swarup/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Modi himself has kept quiet about Mr. Adani’s ordeals. But last week, spokesmen for India’s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, lashed out, making it clear they regarded the U.S. action against Mr. Adani as an attack on India itself. The U.S. State Department and the American “Deep State,” they said, were conspiring with their political opponents in “an attempt to destabilize India.”</p><p>The U.S. embassy in New Delhi called the accusation “disappointing.”</p><p>The extraordinary attack on the United States, a key geopolitical partner of India’s, revealed how deeply India’s ruling party sees its interests conjoined with Mr. Adani’s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Bhaskar Chakravorti, the dean of global business at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said that Mr. Adani “has provided a lot of soft support” to Mr. Modi’s government.</p><p>The two had been allies since their careers took off in the state of Gujarat 25 years ago. And Mr. Adani’s track record of big deals and public works projects, Mr. Chakravorti said, has helped India finally be “part of a global infrastructure development community.” It is a role that Mr. Modi has championed for India since he took office 10 years ago.</p><p>On Nov. 21 this year, just hours after the U.S. indictment bombshell dropped, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/world/africa/kenya-president-ruto.html" title="">President William Ruto of Kenya</a> faced parliament in Nairobi for his annual State of the Nation address.</p><p>Mr. Ruto was already in hot water. His administration is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/africa/kenya-femicide-protests.html" title="">confronting massive discontent</a> over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/world/africa/kenya-protests-taxes.html" title="">rising taxes</a> and food prices, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/world/africa/uganda-opposition-leader-kidnapped-court.html" title="">abductions</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/world/africa/kenya-protests-abductions-taxes.html" title="">killings</a>. The president and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ntvkenya/reel/DBEbF9cK9dF/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his allies</a> had also been stuck having to defend the two Adani Group projects — a deal to improve Kenya’s electricity grid and a proposal to modernize the country’s biggest airport, which critics decried as corrupt and wasteful.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The news from New York gave Mr. Ruto a reason to reverse course.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kenya’s President, William Ruto, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Harish Tyagi/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Based on new information provided by our investigative agencies and partner nations,” Mr. Ruto said, he was instructing Kenyan officials to “immediately commence the process of onboarding alternative partners” for the projects, which together totaled over $2.5 billion.</p><p>Saving face, the Adani Group later said that there had not been a binding agreement with Kenya to work on Nairobi’s airport, which would have been the larger part of the investment. The company also defended its position by arguing that not only were the criminal charges baseless, but they also would not disrupt its operations.</p><p>A few days later, on Nov. 30, Mr. Adani made a show of strength during an appearance at an awards event. “Every attack makes us stronger,” he said. “And every obstacle becomes a steppingstone for a more resilient Adani Group.”</p><p>But the chaos in Kenya was just the beginning. Some of India’s state governments, those not controlled by Mr. Modi’s party, have threatened to review or cancel big contracts with Adani. Opposition members in Parliament, demanding an inquiry into the U.S. allegations against the company — which they constantly equate with Mr. Modi’s government — have forced its adjournment through most of the past three weeks.</p><p>Foreign sources of funding could soon freeze too, if they haven’t already.</p><p>On Nov. 25, TotalEnergies, a Paris-based behemoth with a 20 percent stake in Adani Green Energy, said it would <a href="https://totalenergies.com/news/press-releases/totalenergies-statement-its-investments-related-adani-group-india" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pause</a> investing in new Adani projects. One of Adani’s biggest investors, GQG Partners based in Miami, was downgraded by analysts at UBS and lost 13 percent of its market value overnight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>As questions grow about the conglomerate’s ability to continue to raise money, more foreign governments have been questioning Adani projects.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, where Adani is redeveloping the Port of Colombo and building wind power plants, a new government was already reviewing some projects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port began a major expansion financed by U.S. investments and led by the Adani Group.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thilina Kaluthotage/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>After the indictment, an American foreign development agency, which had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/business/sri-lanka-port-dfc-adani.html" title="">committed half a billion dollars</a> to the port project last year, said it had not disbursed any money yet because it was still doing due diligence. On Dec. 11, Adani responded by going it alone — writing in a company filing that it would drop the U.S. funding and find a way to pay for the project on its own. </p><p>Even before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/bangladesh-banks.html" title="">Bangladesh</a> tossed out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/world/asia/bangladesh-protest-sheikh-hasina.html" title="">an India-friendly autocrat</a> in August, its interim government was in a payment dispute with Adani over electricity that it contracted to buy from plants in India. Its energy minister told Reuters on Dec. 1 that Bangladesh wants Adani to drastically reduce its rates, unless the high court cancels the deal altogether. He added that the U.S. indictment has no bearing on the legal review.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>During the decade that Mr. Modi has been in power, the Adani Group has become a critical infrastructure player farther afield in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. When Mr. Modi ascended to power, Mr. Adani was branching into Indonesia and Australia, mostly mining and trading coal. Now, it has operations or plans reported in at least eight other countries, including Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Tanzania. A week after Donald J. Trump won re-election, Mr. Adani said his companies would invest $10 billion in projects in the United States.</p><p>The Adani Group frequently denies there is any blurring between its interests and India’s. But the perception abroad is consistent. Mr. Chakravorti from the Fletcher School said that Mr. Modi and Mr. Adani’s “close personal relationship” has facilitated a lot of introductions to other governments.</p><p>One such deal, Mr. Chakravorti said, was in Israel, where an Adani conglomerate, in collaboration with a local partner, bought the port in Haifa for $1.18 billion. Israel’s ambassador to India was among the first to say that the indictment would not cause any problems in their relationship.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Gautam Adani after the Adani Group completed the purchase of the port in Haifa last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Cohen/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Problems are developing elsewhere.</p><p>In Kenya, political analysts say President Ruto’s about-face only weakened him further.
