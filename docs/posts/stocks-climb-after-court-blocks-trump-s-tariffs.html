Although the ruling is subject to appeal, the latest twist in the on-again, off-again tariff drama is set to “lift investors’ spirits,” wrote Derren Nathan, head of equity research at the brokerage firm Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/technology/nvidia-earnings-ai-chips.html" title="">Nvidia</a>, the chip giant, pulled the market higher after it reported strong earnings growth on Wednesday and suggested that the tech industry’s embrace of artificial intelligence had ample room to run. Its stock, which exerts an outsize influence over major indexes, surged 5 percent.</p><p>Markets elsewhere were mixed, with stocks in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea all rising more than 1 percent. But indexes in Europe fluctuated between small gains and losses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Bond markets were choppy. The yield on the 30-year Treasury note — a focus for investors after Mr. Trump’s bill to cut taxes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/bond-market-debt-deficit.html" title="">deepened worries about debt and deficits</a> — briefly rose, crossing back above 5 percent, before turning lower. </p><p>Analysts at Panmure Liberum noted that the court ruling suggested that in the long run, “extreme tariffs and rapidly changing tariffs are less likely to happen going forward, which reduces uncertainty somewhat.” But in the short term, they said, the ruling and subsequent challenges to it “will add significant uncertainty to the mix, making it even harder for U.S. businesses to plan.”</p><p>White House officials sought to convey the message that little had changed as a result of the court’s ruling, saying that they had other avenues for pursuing tariffs. “Nothing’s really changed,” said Peter Navarro, President Trump’s trade adviser.</p><p>Markets could continue to bob up and down on tariff developments, as investors now parse court rulings and appeals in addition to Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/business/stock-market-trump-tariffs.html" title="">threats, delays and concessions</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jason Karaian is the business news director, based in London.
