It was 1996, and an ultrasound had revealed fibroids growing in the walls of her uterus.</p><p>But she knew what the procedure had done to her mother: After her ovaries and uterus were removed in her 40s, her mother faded into a sad, irritable shadow of herself.</p><p>So after giving birth, Dr. Alexander opted for surgery to prune back the fibroids.

Nearly 500,000 patients had a uterus removed in 2020. By the time they die, nearly half of women will have lost their uterus.</p><p>There are few procedures in which patients routinely go under the knife without understanding their full range of options — or leave the operating room not knowing exactly which of their organs remain. But that is exactly what happens to many hysterectomy patients today.</p><p>Dr. Emily Von Bargen, a urogynecologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, often sees women who have undergone a hysterectomy but don’t know exactly which of their organs were removed. “I would say 50 percent of patients don’t know the specifics around their surgery,” she said. “It really is mind-blowing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-8"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Much of the confusion boils down to two words often used to describe a hysterectomy: “total” and “partial.”</p><p>A total hysterectomy removes both the uterus and the cervix, the muscular doughnut at the base of the uterus. A partial, or supracervical, hysterectomy leaves the cervix in place. (A radical hysterectomy, a rarer procedure performed in cases of cancer, removes the uterus, cervix, surrounding tissue and sometimes the upper part of the vagina.)</p><p>The key distinction is this: a hysterectomy refers only to the uterus and cervix. Removal of the ovaries is a separate procedure, known as an oophorectomy. That means no matter what kind of hysterectomy you are getting, the ovaries may also be removed — or not.</p><p>Yet many patients still believe a total hysterectomy automatically includes ovarian removal, said Catherine, 78, a moderator of the hysterectomy support forum HysterSisters who asked to be identified by her first name to protect her privacy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Therefore, they think a partial hysterectomy means the removal of the uterus and the cervix, but not of the ovaries or the fallopian tubes.</p><p>Adding to the confusion, some surgeons also use these terms incorrectly, said Dr. Von Bargen. “I always say, what does a hysterectomy mean to you?” she said. “Because to some people, a partial hysterectomy means keeping my ovaries.”</p><p>Dr. Cheryl Iglesia, a urogynecologist in Washington, D.C., said it was also common for women to believe they had undergone a total hysterectomy, only to learn later upon examination that they still had a cervix. This means they may still need regular Pap smears.</p><p>“Some people are shocked when you tell them,” she said. In addition, “they don’t necessarily always know what happened with the tubes or ovaries.”</p><p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695678/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2009 survey</a> of women in Washington State who had undergone hysterectomies found that “a substantial proportion” believed they had one ovary removed, when in fact both were. Among more than 700 Norwegian patients who thought their ovaries had been removed, one-third actually still had ovaries, a 2024 <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1471-0528.17859" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6676751/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a study in Michigan</a> found that, even after consulting with a doctor, a “considerable proportion” of women undergoing hysterectomies did not understand which organs would be removed. Of 144 women who reported that they were having a partial hysterectomy, only 15 actually did; others actually had a total hysterectomy.</p><p>“That’s crazy, right?” said Dr. Zeinab Kassem, a fellow in maternal and fetal medicine at Tufts University and the lead author of the Michigan study. “You’re forced to speculate, why?”</p><p>One reason for the confusion, she said, could be that other common surgeries — gallbladder removal, hip replacement — typically involve a single, obvious body part. With reproductive organs, “you see them as all just one big organ, lumped together, with one purpose,” she said. “But the reality is, no, the ovaries serve a specific purpose on their own.”</p><h2 id="link-1d604ba6">Compartmentalized Thinking</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Karen Tang, a gynecologist in Bryn Mawr, Pa. “At a certain point in history, it seemed like everyone was just getting everything out for the most minor of indications,” she said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hannah Beier for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Historically, surgeons considered the uterus and the ovaries a package deal.

Before 2008, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3791619/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than half</a> of women who underwent a hysterectomy for reasons other than cancer had their ovaries removed as well.</p><p>“At a certain point in history, it seemed like everyone was just getting everything out for the most minor of indications,” said Dr. Karen Tang, a gynecologic surgeon outside Philadelphia. “They just didn’t realize how severe the health risks were.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In the end, it was a layperson who challenged obstetrician-gynecologists to look at those risks more closely. Around 2000, Janine O’Leary Cobb, a Canadian women’s health activist who ran an early menopause newsletter, grew worried about the consequences of ovary removal.</p><p>Her readers had been writing in to describe severe menopause symptoms after the procedure. Research was scarce, but there were hints in the literature that removing the ovaries increased the risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8602000/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heart disease</a>.</p><p>It did not take having a medical background to find this practice alarming, said Ms. O’Leary Cobb, now 91. “The human body evolved a certain way for certain reasons, and taking things out willy-nilly — it just doesn’t make sense that it would have no consequences,” she said.</p><p>She shared her concerns with Dr. William Parker, an OB-GYN and clinical professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>Dr. Parker had written a popular book on women’s health in which he suggested — conservatively, for the time — that women over 45 consider having their ovaries removed as “good prevention” for ovarian cancer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Now he wondered if he had been right. Dr. Parker called up a former student who had trained in statistical analysis and assembled a team to find out.</p><p>Working without funding, the researchers developed a mathematical model that would weigh survival rates for women who kept their ovaries or had them removed, drawing on data from 200 published studies.</p><p>The results were sobering. Dr. Parker and his colleague found that ovarian cancer, while deadly, was also rare: A woman was 35 times more likely to die of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29286988/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cardiovascular disease</a>, and about three times as likely to die of hip fracture. Both ailments were <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jwh.2022.0207" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">risks</a> of early menopause, an unavoidable consequence of removing the ovaries.</p><p>The decision to remove ovaries as a cancer prevention measure “should be approached with great caution,” they concluded in an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16055568/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial study in 2005</a>.</p><p>Soon, Dr. Rocca and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic added to this evidence, linking the removal of the ovaries before menopause to a higher risk of cognitive decline and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17761551/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dementia</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Dr. Parker, however, was not finished. He realized he could compare the long-term health outcomes for thousands of women who had had hysterectomies with or without ovarian removal, using data from almost 30,000 women in the national Nurses’ Health Study who had been tracked for decades.</p><p>By 2009, the consequences were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19384117/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clear</a>: Removing the ovaries was associated with an array of disease risks, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19034050/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heart disease</a>, osteoporosis, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19384117/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stroke</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3183929/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lung cancer</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17761549/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease</a> and dementia.

Nevertheless, over the following decade, the hysterectomy was — quietly — decoupled from ovarian removal. In one county in Minnesota, Dr. Rocca and colleagues <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35576330/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documented</a> an 80 percent decline in the rate of oophorectomies among premenopausal women from 2005 to 2018.</p><p>No longer were the ovaries viewed as solely reproductive organs whose purpose was limited to pregnancy and childbirth. They were also batteries that powered the body’s health, contributing to skin elasticity, heart health, brain health and bone density.</p><p>In 2007, “when I started my residency, we were just like, Yeah, let’s take out the ovaries,” said Dr. Tang. By 2010, “we had pretty much stopped, cold turkey.”</p><p>These days, instead of the ovaries, surgeons performing a hysterectomy usually remove the fallopian tubes, where most ovarian cancer is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/health/ovarian-cancer-fallopian-tubes.html" title="">believed to originate</a>.
