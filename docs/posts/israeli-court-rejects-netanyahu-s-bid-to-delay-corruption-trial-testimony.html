    <h1>Israeli Court Rejects Netanyahu’s Bid to Delay Corruption Trial Testimony</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The court ruled that Mr. Netanyahu must take the stand on Dec. 2, after having already delayed his testimony once. On Wednesday, it quickly rejected another request, filed by Mr. Netanyahu late Sunday, asking to push his testimony back by a further 10 weeks.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu argued that he was too busy during wartime to prepare a defense, though he has long said that he can be prime minister and on trial at the same time. </p><p>The court found that its previous ruling, setting the testimony date for early December, had taken the war and other considerations into account. The state prosecution and the attorney general had argued that any further delay was against the public interest for the trial to end as soon as possible, citing the principle of equality before the law.</p><p>“We have not been convinced of any significant change in circumstances that would justify changing the date,” the judges wrote in their decision on Wednesday.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu declined to comment. </p></div></div>
