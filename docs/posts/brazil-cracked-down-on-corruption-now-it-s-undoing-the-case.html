The reversals are also casting doubt over many other cases in Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Argentina, including the convictions of several former presidents.</p><p>It all amounts to a broad unraveling of Operation Car Wash, a sweeping investigation that, starting a decade ago, uncovered a vast corruption scheme spanning at least 12 countries. Investigators found that corporations had paid billions of dollars in bribes to government officials in exchange for public projects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The findings upended Latin America’s political landscape, shutting down multinational businesses and leading to billions of dollars in fines and hundreds of convictions. Some of the region’s most prominent politicians and executives were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/world/americas/brazil-lula-da-silva-corruption.html" title="">sent to prison, including President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil</a>.</p><p>Its undoing is now a dreary conclusion to an investigation that had once been viewed as a sea change in Latin America, promising to root out systemic corruption that had rotted the underpinnings of governments.</p><p>The public had cheered the convictions as a new dawn for the region. A decade later, Brazil and other nations have little to show for it. For some, the reversal is another example of the impunity those in power have long enjoyed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>José Antonio Dias Toffoli, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, has set aside major convictions arising from Operation Car Wash.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dado Galdieri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“People who should be paying for their mistakes or their crimes, to some extent, will get away with it,” said Maíra Fernandes, a criminal lawyer and professor at the Getúlio Vargas Institute, a Brazilian university.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the same time, she added, the reversals are not without merit. Leaked recordings and other evidence showed that a judge and prosecutors had coordinated against defendants, employed aggressive tactics to force confessions and ordered illegal wiretaps. “Even if it leaves a bitter taste,” she said, “it’s a consequence of an operation that dirtied its hands, that violated the rules.”</p><p>In 2018, a far-right lawmaker named Jair Bolsonaro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-profile.html" title="">used an anti-corruption message</a> to ride Operation Car Wash’s momentum to Brazil’s presidency. But his administration was then also stained with corruption scandals, and he ultimately <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/bolsonaro-declares-brazil-corruption-free-and-ends-carwash-probe?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shuttered Car Wash</a> as new investigations began looking into his family. This past week, Brazilian authorities recommended charges against him for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/americas/bolsonaro-coup-brazil-election-charges.html" title="">plotting a coup</a> after he lost the presidency in 2022.</p><p>Most of the decisions to reverse Operation Car Wash have been issued by a single Brazilian Supreme Court justice, José Antonio Dias Toffoli. In an interview, Justice Toffoli said his decisions were based on prior rulings by his Supreme Court colleagues that Car Wash investigators, prosecutors and judges had illegally colluded, invalidating the evidence collected. He said he had merely extended that decision to other cases.</p><p>“Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict,” he said.</p><p>“We do this with great sadness,” he added during a recent Supreme Court hearing. “Because the state has proceeded wrongly.”</p><p>Some critics, however, believe Justice Toffoli should not be deciding the cases.</p><p>Before joining the Supreme Court, he worked as a lawyer for Mr. Lula’s political party and, later, as counsel to Mr. Lula as president. In 2009, Mr. Lula nominated him to the nation’s highest court. Mr. Lula and his party were central targets of the Car Wash investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The justice was also once linked to the investigation he is now dismantling.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A subway line in Caracas, Venezuela, under construction in 2022 by Odebrecht, a giant Brazilian firm and a key player in Operation Car Wash, according to Brazilian authorities.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Federico Parra/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In 2019, Marcelo Odebrecht, the chief executive of Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant, named Justice Toffoli in a statement to the police about the company’s corruption scheme, suggesting the judge may have played a role, according to <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/odebrecht-diz-que-amigo-do-amigo-de-meu-pai-citado-em-email-era-toffoli.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local news reports</a>.</p><p>Justice Toffoli denied any involvement and was never formally charged with a crime.</p><p>“The accusations are so untrue that the interested parties have never formally challenged my participation in these cases,” he said in an interview.</p><p>After reports linking him to the scheme, Justice Toffoli made a highly unusual move to grant the Supreme Court the authority to open its own investigation into attacks against the court itself.</p><p>He called the investigation the Fake News Inquiry, and in one of its first acts, a fellow justice ordered a magazine to <a href="https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2019/04/15/stf-censura-reportagem-que-liga-dias-toffoli-presidente-da-corte-a-odebrecht.ghtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">censor an article</a> linking Justice Toffoli to Car Wash.

This year, he opened a criminal investigation into Transparency International, a Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog, after it had criticized his moves to reverse Car Wash rulings.</p><p>He told investigators to check old leaked recordings in which a Transparency International official, Bruno Brandão, discussed directing some Car Wash fines to the group’s anti-corruption efforts.</p><p>Transparency International denied the accusations. Last month, Brazil’s top federal prosecutor <a href="https://comunidade.transparenciainternacional.org.br/pet-12061-manifestacao-pgr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked the Supreme Court</a> to drop the investigation, citing no evidence of wrongdoing. Mr. Brandão said in an interview that Justice Toffoli’s rulings had “opened the floodgates for impunity.”</p><p>Operation Car Wash began in 2014, when Brazil’s federal police busted a money-laundering operation at a carwash in the nation’s capital. After some digging, they realized they had stumbled upon something much, much bigger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Over time, investigators discovered that some of Brazil’s biggest companies — including a group behind the beef giant JBS, the state oil company Petrobras and Odebrecht — had been bribing officials in power across Latin America and Africa in exchange for lucrative government contracts.
