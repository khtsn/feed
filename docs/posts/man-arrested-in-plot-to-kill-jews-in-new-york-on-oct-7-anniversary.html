plotting to kill “as many Jewish civilians as possible” in New York City on or near the first anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israelis, according to a Justice Department complaint unsealed Friday.</p><p>Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, who lived in Canada, tried to cross the border with the intention of traveling to New York City, where he planned to carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn, in support of the Islamic State, prosecutors said.</p><p>“New york is perfect to target jews,” he wrote to an associate, according to the filing, adding, “We could rack up easily a lot of jews.”</p><p>Mr. Khan was taken into custody by Canadian authorities on Wednesday after trying to enter the United States from Ormstown, about 12 miles north of the New York State border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/pakistani-national-charged-plotting-terrorist-attack-new-york-city-support-isis-0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">complaint</a>, filed in the Southern District of New York, also mentions an unnamed “associate,” but it was unclear whether that person was in custody or an informant.</p><p>Mr. Khan is charged with one count of an attempt to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, ISIS, and faces up to 20 years in prison.</p><p>In a statement, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland thanked F.B.I. investigators and said U.S. officials were “deeply grateful to our Canadian partners for their critical law enforcement actions in this matter.”</p><p>“Jewish communities — like all communities in this country — should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack,” he said.</p><p>Starting last November, law enforcement officials in the United States and Canada began monitoring his electronic communications after he posted expressions of support for ISIS and distributed propaganda videos and literature from groups that had been designated as terrorist organizations in both countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His encrypted messages that prosecutors detailed centered on efforts to recruit members for a terror cell, obtain an arsenal and identify Jewish targets in New York.</p><p>Two of the people he believed were fellow ISIS supporters were in fact undercover law enforcement officials. Over the course of the past year, they have collected detailed information about his intention to carry out a “coordinated assault” using AR-15-style weapons to target Jewish or Israel-related targets, including institutions associated with the Chabad Hasidic movement.</p><p>Mr. Khan believed that Oct. 7 would be an ideal time to attack because large numbers of Jews would be gathered for the anniversary, and because it came four days before Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. He originally had intended to attack an unnamed city, prosecutors said, but switched to New York after noting that it had a higher concentration of Jewish people.</p><p>The Justice Department has begun extradition proceedings against Mr. Khan. It was not immediately clear if he had obtained legal representation in the United States.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>14</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Man Arrested in Plot to Kill Jews in New York on Oct. 7<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-justice-department">U.S. Justice Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/islamic-state">Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>An Israeli Presence Postwar?:</strong><strong> </strong>Gaza cease-fire talks have stalled again, in part over Israel’s demand to retain a military presence in the territory, which Hamas and Egypt oppose. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/world/middleeast/gaza-war-cease-fire-israel.html">But the view among some Gazans on that point is less clear-cut</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel&#39;s Many Wars</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/world/middleeast/israel-wars-gaza-lebanon-west-bank.html">the war with Hamas in Gaza attracts the most attention</a>, Israel is also battling along its border with Lebanon, waging a counterinsurgency in the occupied West Bank and exchanging sporadic fire with Iran and its regional proxies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Digs In:</strong><strong> </strong>In his first news conference since the bodies of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/hostages-gaza-what-to-know.html">six killed hostages</a> were recovered, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/middleeast/netanyahu-gaza-war-protests-hostages.html">refused to budge on his conditions for any truce in Gaza</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden’s Terse Rebuke:</strong><strong> </strong>President Biden, when asked whether Netanyahu was doing enough to secure a deal to free hostages in Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/middleeast/biden-netanyahu-hostage-ceasefire-deal-israel.html">responded simply: “No.”</a></p></li><li><p><strong>The Hostages Still in Gaza:</strong><strong> </strong>Dozens of hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel remain in captivity, according to the Israeli authorities. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/world/middleeast/hostages-in-gaza-hamas.html">Here is what we know about them</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
