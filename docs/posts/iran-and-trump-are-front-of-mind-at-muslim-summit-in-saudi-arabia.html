It takes place amid heightened regional tensions and the prospect of a hawkish Trump administration on Iran.</p><p>Saudi Arabia had been preparing to recognize Israel, but the wars in Gaza and Lebanon cooled that prospect. Now, the kingdom and its allies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/world/middleeast/israel-saudi-arabia-iran-gulf.html" title="">find themselves warming to Tehran</a>. Last month, the foreign ministers of the Gulf states met for the first time as a group with their Iranian counterpart. On Sunday, the Saudi and Iranian military chiefs met in Tehran — further signaling a thaw in relations as Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/world/middleeast/iran-threatens-retaliation-israel-strikes.html" title="">considers a response</a> to Israeli attacks on its territory.</p><p>Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, emphasized the relationship in his opening remarks at the event, a joint summit of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We call on the international community to compel Israel to respect Iran’s sovereignty and not to attack its territory,” he told the audience in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran have been locked in a long battle for regional dominance, a rivalry shaped by the competing branches of Islam that each country embraces. Iran’s network of regional proxies — which includes Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — has long been a particular source of concern for Saudi Arabia.</p><p>While Hamas and Hezbollah have been weakened by the Israeli military’s operations in Gaza and Lebanon, Iran still arms and supports the Houthis in Yemen — a group that has been implicated in attacks on the kingdom.</p><p>“The issue that we’ve had, and that was the basis for the divergence in our relationship, was Iran’s regional behavior, which from our perspective has not contributed to stability,” the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, said last week. “We are having very, very clear and honest conversations with the Iranians.”</p><p>The vice president of Iran, Mohammad Rez Aref, called what has happened in Gaza and Lebanon a “shameful catastrophe” on Monday in his address to the summit, urging “collective action” to stop Israeli aggression, <a href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85656693/Iran-urges-collective-action-from-Muslim-nations-to-stop-Israel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Iranian state news media.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But not everyone in Riyadh appeared keen to pursue further alignment. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, demanded that countries stop “interfering in its internal affairs by supporting this or that group” — an implicit reference to Iran’s longtime support of Hezbollah.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Houthi soldiers marching in Sanaa, Yemen, earlier this month.

President-elect Donald J. Trump has said he will “stop wars” when he takes office, noted Hasan Alhasan, a senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p><p>“Saudi Arabia could be trying to position itself as an attractive and credible choice for the Trump administration to work with if Trump follows through with his pledge to broker a deal to end the war, especially given the fact that diplomatic efforts led by other regional mediators, notably Qatar and Egypt, have failed to bear fruit,” Mr. Alhasan said.</p><p>Last year’s summit was held not long after Israel launched a war against Hamas in Gaza in response to the militant group’s deadly Oct. 7 attack on its soil. The leaders in attendance at that summit <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/palestine-israel/2023/11/11/arab-and-islamic-summit-on-gaza-calls-for-israel-arms-embargo/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called in their communiqué for an arms embargo</a> against Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the months since, the death toll in Gaza has climbed above 43,000 people, according to health officials in the enclave. And Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon to fight Hezbollah.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/en/N2205878" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">communiqué issued on Monday</a> at the end of this year’s summit bore many similarities to the one issued a year prior — it condemned Israeli aggression in Gaza, again calling for an arms embargo.</p><p>It also warned about the danger of escalation and the expansion of the fighting to Lebanon — along with violations of the sovereignty of Iran.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ismaeel Naar is an international reporter for The Times, covering the Gulf states.
