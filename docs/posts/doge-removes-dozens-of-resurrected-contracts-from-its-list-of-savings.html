Then, late Sunday, Mr. Musk’s group deleted those claims for 31 of the contracts from its website, eliminating $122 million of the savings it claimed to have achieved by cutting federal contracts.</p><p>Those savings had actually <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJeY6GkNk1C/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disappeared days or weeks</a> before, when federal agencies reversed cancellations they had made at the behest of Mr. Musk’s group. One revived contract, which DOGE said was worth $108 million, was restored by the Department of Veterans Affairs after eight days. Mr. Musk’s group still listed it as “terminated” for two months after that.</p><p>The presence of revived contracts on DOGE’s list of “terminations” was the latest in a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">data errors</a> that have inflated its success at saving money. In the past, the group has deleted other errors from its “Wall of Receipts” site after new reports found that they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/upshot/doge-spending-cuts-changed.html?searchResultPosition=" title="">double-counting the same cancellations</a> or claiming credit for killing contracts that had ended <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-errors.html" title="">decades before.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Sunday night, Mr. Musk’s group also added more than 800 new terminated contracts and raised its overall savings estimate — across all government activity, not only contracts — to $170 billion from $165 billion. The group did not delete all of the resurrected contracts identified by The Times. It left 12 on the site, still claiming that terminating those had saved taxpayers $121 million.</p><p>Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said the webpage would continue to be updated. He defended Mr. Musk’s group in a statement: “DOGE is working at record speed to cut waste, fraud and abuse, producing historic savings for the American people.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David A.
