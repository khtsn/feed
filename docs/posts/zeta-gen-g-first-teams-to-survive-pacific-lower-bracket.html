<p>Through the first match between ZETA and Secret, both teams lost on their own map picks. Starting on Bind, ZETA opted for a double-Duelist with Waylay and Raze, and Secret ran a double-Duelist comp with Yoru and Raze. Team Secret won the first pistol and converted the bonus round to get ahead to an early lead. After the economy finally balanced out for ZETA, the first half did reach a 4-4 tie, but that was the final round that ZETA won on the entire map. The Yoru from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/7437/kellys">
		kellyS	</a>
</span> was outstanding as Secret reached the half up 8-4. Secret then won the second pistol and converted the second bonus, leading to a 13-4 win. </p>

<p>Moving to Split, ZETA needed to fight back. Both teams remained on unique double-Duelist compositions, but ZETA reached that perfect start that Secret had on Bind. <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/25221/xdll">
		Xdll	</a>
</span> led ZETA to an 11-1 lead at halftime with a 17/5/4 statline, frying his opponents on Fade. </p>


<p><em>Xdll and ZETA dominate Team Secret to start Split.</em></p>

<p>Team Secret managed to win the second pistol, but a lost bonus conversion also put ZETA on map point. There just wasn&#39;t enough runway for Secret, as ZETA won Secret&#39;s map pick 13-4. </p>

<p>That meant it would all end on Abyss, and it was the first close map of the series. Again, both teams stuck to different variations of double-Duelist. ZETA won the pistol, but was unable to convert the bonus. Secret fought back to keep the half close, taking a small 7-5 lead at the half.  </p>

<p>ZETA won the second pistol of the map, but once again lost the bonus to stay slightly behind Secret. After trying the map 8-8, the momentum swung to ZETA, as the Waylay from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/1960/eko">
		eKo	</a>
</span> was dominant on the defense side. Even as Secret brought the map and series win within reach, the win was closed out by ZETA 13-11 to take the series 2-1.</p>



<p>Game two between Gen.G and VARREL was a lot closer, starting with a tight Breeze. Both teams ran mirror compositions of double-Duelist with Jett and Yoru, and despite a Gen.G pistol win and antieco loss, rounds were traded as Gen.G took a small lead. As Gen.G finally was able to pull multiple round wins consecutively, <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/34974/karon">
		Karon	</a>
</span> popped off on Viper to pull his team to an 8-4 lead at the half.</p>


<p><em>Karon shoots down three in his ultimate on Breeze.</em></p>

<p>Gen.G won the second pistol and, despite a bonus round loss, reached double-digit round wins and a prime position to win map one. VARREL fought back to reach double-digits too, but that was too late as Gen.G managed to convert Breeze 13-10.</p>

<p>Pearl was an entertaining map, starting with the continuation of double-Duelist, but the introduction of Sentinel agents like Killjoy and Cypher. Gen.G won the first pistol and converted the bonus, placing the team in a great position to close out the series quickly. Yet, VARREL fought back with <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4426/klaus">
		Klaus	</a>
</span> on Cypher stepping up, closing the deficit to only 7-5 at the half.</p>

<p>Gen.G won the second pistol and after a failed bonus round conversion, reached a 10-6 lead. This was where VARREL started and eventually completed a big comeback against an experienced team. The star of the comeback was <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/42733/xuna">
		XuNa	</a>
</span>, who stepped up on Sova to force the map to overtime. With multiple overtime ties, <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2149/c1nder">
		C1ndeR	</a>
</span> redeemed himself after a rough regular time with an amazing OT performance, as VARREL won Pearl 20-18. </p>

<p>Haven was the decider, and VARREL looked to keep the momentum from the unlikely Pearl victory. Both teams ran mirror compositions yet again, with Jett and Yoru matched with Cypher. Gen.G won the first pistol, converted the bonus, and ran off to a 6-0 lead. That momentum from Pearl was gone, as Gen.G reached the half up 9-3.</p>

<p>VARREL won the second pistol, but lost the bonus round. After Gen.G reached an 11-6 lead, VARREL was unable to do another late comeback as Gen.G won the series 2-1 and kept its Kickoff run alive.</p>

<p>With these victories, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/595653/drx-vs-zeta-division-vct-2026-pacific-kickoff-lr2" target="_blank">ZETA will face DRX</a> while <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/595654/global-esports-vs-gen-g-vct-2026-pacific-kickoff-lr2" target="_blank">Gen.G matches up against Global Esports</a> in the lower bracket.</p>
