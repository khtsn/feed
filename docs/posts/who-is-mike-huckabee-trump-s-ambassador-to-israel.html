Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East.”</p><p>But the nomination prompted an outcry from some Democrats and others on the left. Lawmakers, lobbyists and faith groups of various denominations raised objections, saying his positions on Israel and on Palestinians’ identity and national aspirations are divisive and undermine American interests. Only one Democrat, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, a staunch and outspoken supporter of Israel, crossed party lines to vote for Mr. Huckabee.<span>   </span></p><p>Here’s what you need to know about Mr. Huckabee’s position on Israel, Palestinians and the conflicts in the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-8af95f7">What are his ties to Israel?</h2><p>At his nomination hearing, Mr. Huckabee said that his first trip to Israel was in 1973 and that he had been moved by the experience. He described Israel as “holy ground to Jews, Christians and Muslims.”</p><p>His support for Israel is rooted in his belief that God made a covenant with the Jews in the Old Testament, giving them a claim to the land that stands. In 1981, Mr. Huckabee began leading trips to Israel and has taken about 10,000 people there in the years since, he told senators, visiting the country about 100 times. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Huckabee visiting an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem in 2009.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Hollander/European Pressphoto Agency</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4c2cdc4b">What has he said about Palestinians?</h2><p>In 2008, on the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/mike-huckabee-palestinian-comments-trump-israel-ambassador/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presidential campaign trail</a> in Massachusetts, Mr. Huckabee said “there is no such thing as a Palestinian,” calling the identity “a political tool to try and force land away from Israel.” </p><p>Mr. Huckabee is a staunch supporter of the Israeli settlement movement. On a 2018 visit, he participated in a groundbreaking ceremony in a settlement and said he “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/mike-huckabee-israeli-occupied-west-bank-efrat-holiday-home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">might want to purchase a holiday home</a>” there. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2015, while he was running for president a second time and was in Jerusalem, he rejected the terms “occupied” and “West Bank” when speaking to reporters. Instead, he referred to the territory as “Judea and Samaria,” <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/19/in-jerusalem-mike-huckabee-calls-west-bank-part-of-israel/" title="">using the biblical name</a> of the area to bolster Israel’s claim to the land. He has backed Israeli annexation of the West Bank.</p><p>At his nomination hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Huckabee was questioned by Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee, about his “highly incendiary” statements.</p><p>He declined “to articulate or even defend” his views, he said, noting that he would be advancing administration policies, not his positions.</p><p>When questioned about Mr. Trump’s assertion in February that the United States could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-gaza-strip-netanyahu.html" title="">take over the Gaza Strip</a> and Palestinians would move to neighboring nations, Mr. Huckabee said the president did not mean “forced displacement.”</p><p>“They shouldn’t be forced” out, he said. Mr. Trump, he said, was talking about finding people “safe haven.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When asked about the war between Israel and Hamas and its effect on civilians in Gaza, Mr. Huckabee dismissed concerns about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/europe/israel-aid-gaza-cease-fire-proposal.html" title="">Israel’s decision to cut off aid</a> entering the enclave in early March, saying “massive supplies” had entered. He also expressed support for the Israeli military’s use of American-supplied heavy bombs.</p><p>Mr. Huckabee has long rejected the establishment of a Palestinian state. His supporters, like the America First Policy Institute, a right-wing policy group, point to his <a href="https://americafirstpolicy.com/issues/america-first-nomination-mike-huckabee" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposition to a two-state solution</a> for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a reason to embrace him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters interrupted Mr. Huckabee’s confirmation hearing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-7a82020e">What do critics say?</h2><p>More than 65 leftist, faith-based and human rights organizations <a href="https://www.mpowerchange.org/rejecthuckabee" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged senators</a> to reject the selection of Mr. Huckabee. Among them were Christian, Jewish and Muslim groups that said “his appointment would embolden those who oppose peace and fuel further division, rather than encouraging constructive dialogue and understanding.”</p><p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations sent senators <a href="https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-asks-u-s-senate-to-oppose-anti-muslim-ambassador-nominees-huckabee-hoekstra/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter</a> in February outlining a “history of anti-Muslim statements and inflammatory rhetoric” by Mr. Huckabee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>American Jewish organizations are <a href="https://www.jta.org/2025/03/25/politics/what-jewish-groups-are-saying-ahead-of-mike-huckabees-confirmation-hearing-to-be-israel-ambassador" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">split over Mr. Huckabee</a> for the ambassador post.
