While the president paused a set of punishing levies on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariffs-stocks-china.html" title="">nearly 60 countries</a> last week, his administration has forged ahead with a new 145 percent tax on Chinese exports, which Washington announced after Beijing retaliated against the United States.</p><p>The exclusions in the C.B.P. rule covered a wide slate of products, such as computers, smartphones, modems and flash drives, and it represented a major victory for Apple, Dell and other U.S. technology giants, which rely on Chinese factories to help manufacture important components and popular devices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But on Sunday, the Trump administration sought to cast those exemptions in a different light, framing them as only a temporary break while the government prepares more targeted taxes on semiconductor imports in the coming weeks. To Mr. Trump and his top aides, the United States sources too many of its chips from abroad, threatening the nation’s national and economic security.</p><p>Peter Navarro, a senior White House adviser on trade, insisted on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that they were “not exclusions” at all. Instead, he stressed that the White House still could impose specific tariffs on the computer chips that power countless consumer and military products.</p><p>Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said on ABC’s “This Week” that Mr. Trump could announce new tariffs “in the next month or two” that would target not only semiconductors but also pharmaceutical imports. He added that the administration could act as soon as next week to open an investigation into the semiconductor industry, setting the stage for the government to impose new tariffs on national security grounds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump announced “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly 60 countries earlier this month but abruptly paused most of them last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The approach appears to mirror the process that yielded Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/trump-tariffs-auto-cars.html" title="">tariffs</a> on other specific products and sectors, including high fees he imposed on foreign cars and auto parts.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, told CNN’s “State of the Union” that it was “always the case” that some of these high-tech imports would be subject to their own tariffs, separate from those broadly imposed on countries in response to their trade practices.</p><p>“Semiconductors are a key important part of a lot of defense equipment,” Mr. Hassett added, saying, “I don’t think anything really should be a surprise.”</p><p>Jamieson Greer, the top U.S. trade official, described the move on CBS’s “Face the Nation” as more of a mechanical change, saying of semiconductors that it is “not that they won’t be subject to tariffs” but that they are being done under a “different regime.”</p><p>The Trump administration had already excluded various types of semiconductors from the reciprocal tariffs as of April 2. But the changes announced Friday will make a substantial difference for companies selling laptops, cellphones, televisions and other electronics.</p><p>Still, the potential for new tariffs on chips threatened to cast another pall over the tech industry, even as major lobbying groups representing Intel, Nvidia and other tech companies have encouraged the administration to strike trade deals that ultimately lower trade barriers globally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Asked about the possibility of upcoming tariffs on chips on Saturday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll give you that answer on Monday.”</p><p>“We’ll be very specific,” he added. “But we’re taking in a lot of money. As a country we’re taking in a lot of money.”</p><p>Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors on Sunday that “the mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory and demand.”</p><p>Ultimately, new taxes on chip imports could make it more expensive for U.S. companies to produce smartphones and other devices, cutting into their profits or forcing them to raise prices on American consumers. For Apple, in particular, the tit for tat between the United States and China caused the tech giant to lose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/technology/apple-issues-trump-tariffs.html" title="">more than $770 billion in market capitalization in just the opening days</a> of Mr. Trump’s trade war.</p><p>Since then, the two nations have continued to retaliate against each other, causing financial markets around the world to whipsaw in the face of a persistent and costly standoff. U.S. consumers even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/us/politics/tariffs-china-iphones-panic-shopping.html" title="">appeared to rush out to purchase new iPhones last week</a>, anticipating that a protracted trade conflict could push up prices.</p><p>Tripp Mickle<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ana Swanson<!-- --> contributed to this report.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tony Romm is a reporter covering economic policy and the Trump administration for The Times, based in Washington.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
