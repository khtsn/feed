Around half of the country now disapproves of his performance, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls.html" title="">the polling shows</a>.</p><p>American presidents typically enter office with a groundswell of support that wanes over time. But Mr. Trump’s approval has been dropping slightly faster than that of his predecessors.</p><p>Mr. Trump started his term with the second-lowest approval rating for a president in modern history. The only recent president to have started in a worse position was Mr. Trump the first time he took office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The polling average, assembled by The New York Times, includes nearly all publicly released polls that track Mr. Trump’s approval rating. The goal of a polling average is to balance the biases of individual polls, which can vary in quality and frequency, and to make it easier to track changes in public opinion over time.</p><p>The average does not directly address the causes of the decline in approval, or whether they are driven by specific actions like his enactment of tariffs, his threats toward allies or gyrations in the markets.</p><p>On average, across all polls, Mr. Trump’s numbers continued to fall after he issued sweeping global tariffs by executive order. Though few high-quality polls have been conducted before and after the tariff announcement, most showed no major decline after what Mr. Trump called “Liberation Day.”</p><p>It is still too early to fully capture how an event like that has shaped public opinion.</p><p>In his second term, Mr. Trump has sought to reshape the global economy, crack down on immigration, shrink the federal government and overhaul American law firms and universities. The blitz is part of a “flood the zone” strategy devised by Mr. Trump’s aides and allies to overwhelm any opposition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Trump is following through on many of the promises he made as a candidate, but even some supporters have registered concerns about some of his actions. In particular, the sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries have rankled allies and adversaries. The trade war plunged global economic markets into turmoil, before Mr. Trump paused the tariffs for 90 days, citing talks with other countries about new trade deals.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg/23dc-trump-approval-mjhg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e217055a-b1be-5cb1-8c95-bbf6023057e6" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump now holds a net negative approval rating.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Polls show little drop in his support among Republican voters.</p><p>Much of the decline in approval has come from voters who identify as independent, according to Quinnipiac University polling. His standing with that crucial voting bloc in <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3918" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">January</a> stood at 41 percent approval and 46 percent disapproval. In Quinnipiac’s <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3922" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mid-April poll</a>, 58 percent of independents said they disapproved of the president’s job performance, while just 36 percent approved.</p><p>Pollsters still struggle to fully gauge the strength of Mr. Trump’s support. In 2024, pre-election polls underestimated Mr. Trump on average by around 3 percentage points. But even the polls that most accurately assessed his support, such as AtlasIntel, now show net negative approval ratings.</p><p>Mr. Trump sees his second term as a resounding success. He has bragged about a significant drop in illegal border crossings, billions of dollars in new U.S.-based investments, the release of Americans imprisoned abroad and rooting out diversity initiatives in the public and private sectors.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also promised that new trade deals, including with China, are on the horizon.</p><p>“We’re going to be making money with everyone, and everyone’s going to be happy,” he told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday.</p><p>Irineo Cabreros<!-- --> contributed data analysis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.</p></div><div><p>Ruth Igielnik is a Times polling editor who conducts polls and analyzes and reports on the results.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>15</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Trump’s Bluster Aside, Polling Averages Show Approval Keeps Falling<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/the-new-york-times">The New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/quinnipiac-university">Quinnipiac University</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-approval-rating.html">461</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-approval-rating.html">461</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>No Plans to Fire Powell: </strong>The president said he has “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-jerome-powell-fed.html">no intention” of ousting Jerome Powell</a>, the Federal Reserve chair, but the administration’s willingness to challenge norms regarding the central bank’s political independence is causing concern.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Agency Angst: </strong>The Trump administration has deployed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/eeoc-trump-dei-law-firms.html">to seek retribution against corporate law firms.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>I.M.F. and World Bank: </strong>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/bessent-imf-world-bank-overhauls.html">called for major overhauls to the missions</a> of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank but said that the United States remained committed to maintaining its leadership role at the global economic institutions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Active Research Awards Terminated:</strong> The National Science Foundation canceled more than 400 active awards, according to a list obtained by The Times.
