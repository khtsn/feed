They hit a strip of land called Shebaa Farms — Mount Dov to Israelis — that was seized by Israel in the 1967 war, but is claimed by both Israel and Lebanon.</p><p>The Lebanese armed group said its launches were prompted by “repeated violations of the agreement by the Israeli enemy,” describing it as “an initial defensive response that serves as a warning.”</p><p>Israel’s airstrikes killed at least 10 people in Lebanon on Monday, according to the Lebanese health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since the cease-fire agreement was announced last week, the Israeli military has repeatedly bombarded Lebanon in attacks it says target Hezbollah militants breaching the cease-fire. The truce — mediated by the United States and France — ended more than a year of fighting.</p><p>At least for now, the agreement has mostly held. Neither side appears eager to return to the war, which killed nearly 4,000 people in Lebanon and 100 Israelis, displaced over one million Lebanese and turned Israeli border communities into ghost towns.</p><p>But the emerging tit-for-tat places Israel in a quandary. Israeli officials hope the truce lasts so they can refocus their efforts on the war in Gaza and their regional archenemy, Iran. But they fear Hezbollah will exploit the cease-fire to slowly rebuild its forces near the border with Israel in contravention of the agreement.</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli military said late on Monday that its warplanes had “struck Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon,” and also hit “the Hezbollah launcher in the area of Berghoz in southern Lebanon shortly after the launch of the two projectiles toward Mount Dov.”</p><p>On Monday, Israeli politicians urged a forceful response to the Hezbollah attack, calling it a critical moment for Israel to establish deterrence. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident “a severe violation” of the truce even as he suggested that Israel was not abandoning the cease-fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We are determined to continue enforcing the cease-fire terms, and respond to any violation by Hezbollah — both minor and major,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement.</p><p>Under the cease-fire, Israel is meant to cease all “offensive military operations against Lebanese targets” and gradually withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon over the next 60 days. Hezbollah is to retreat north, away from Israel’s borders, allowing the Lebanese military to deploy there.</p><p>Israel’s leaders say they will “enforce” the terms of the deal militarily to prevent Hezbollah from rebuilding itself near the border. Tolerating even small infractions, they argue, could embolden the Lebanese armed group.</p><p>“We will respond decisively to Hezbollah’s severe violation of the cease-fire, and will continue to do so. We have plans and targets ready to be carried out and at any given moment,” Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, said in a statement on Monday.</p><p>Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting from Beirut.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
