losing to Bill Clinton. Gerald Ford in 1977 allowed for the possibility of a political comeback after being defeated by Jimmy Carter (“This report will be my last — maybe.”) Donald J. Trump was defiant in defeat four years ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/trump-presidency.html" title="">declaring that “we will be back in some form.”</a></p><p>As far back as the 18th century — when George Washington <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/farewell-address" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned the young republic of the dangers of partisanship</a> and called for national unity — presidents have used their twilight days in office to reflect on their records and accomplishments, pleading for the nation to build on their legacies for generations to come.</p><p>That parting message has been at times complicated by the outgoing commander in chief being succeeded by a political rival — especially when being beaten out of a second term.</p><p>The challenge President Biden navigated Wednesday night was similarly delicate, as he highlighted his achievements and reflected on America’s future — even as he hands the reins of government over to Mr. Trump, an adversary whom Mr. Biden has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/biden-trump-transfer-of-power.html" title="">declared a threat to democracy</a>, and who has vowed to undo many of his policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s how some single-term presidents approached their farewell speeches:</p><h2 id="link-6ef820b5">Lyndon B. Johnson urged Congress to protect his legacy.</h2><p>President Lyndon B. Johnson left office in a remarkably similar position to Mr. Biden: Shadowed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/us/politics/biden-columbia-protests-israel-antisemitism.html" title="">contentious foreign wars</a>, and struggling to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/world/middleeast/cia-hamas-israel-cease-fire.html" title="">hammer out a peace agreement with an adversary</a>, Johnson <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/04/01/issue.html" title="">ended his re-election campaign</a> and cleared the way for his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, to be chosen as the Democratic presidential candidate <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/08/29/issue.html" title="">at the party convention in Chicago.</a> (Humphrey was ultimately defeated by Richard Nixon after struggling to distinguish himself from Johnson.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Lyndon B.

In a notably emotional address to the joint session of Congress, Johnson spoke of his efforts to seek a negotiated end to the Vietnam War, and he ticked through an expansive list of legislative accomplishments that he had overseen from the Oval Office, framing the new social programs as “promises to the American people” that must be kept.</p><p>“A failure to carry them out,” Johnson said of his legislative agenda, “would be a tragedy for our country.” Much of that legislation, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Society" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called the Great Society</a> by Johnson, stands today.</p><h2 id="link-514faf29">Gerald R. Ford hoped for a political comeback.</h2><p>President Gerald R. Ford holds a peculiar place in the history of the American presidency, and his farewell speech reflects his unique and shortened term in the Oval Office. He is the only person to serve as president without being elected as president or vice president, as he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/07/archives/ford-sworn-as-vice-president-after-house-approves-38735-he-vows.html" title="">appointed to the vice presidency by Nixon</a>.

Ford ultimately <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/03/16/111769845.html?pageNumber=1" title="">dropped out of contention for a run in 1980</a>, and <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/05/28/111161563.html" title="">backed Ronald Reagan</a>.</p><h2 id="link-d2a1845">George Bush warned against being ‘the world’s policeman.’</h2><p>Appearing at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point two weeks before Bill Clinton’s inauguration, President George Bush made it clear that his loss to Mr. Clinton had bruised him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Losing is never easy.

Give it your best shot. And win or lose, learn from it, and get on with life.”</p><p>But before he got on, Bush delivered a warning to those future military leaders about the state of global affairs. He had just presided over the end of the Cold War, and shepherded the birth of nations and democratic governments in Eastern Europe as the Soviet Union and its sphere of influence <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/the-collapse-of-the-Soviet-Union" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fell apart over the course of his presidency.</a> He had also <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1991/02/24/issue.html" title="">waged war in Iraq</a> to counter an invasion of neighboring Kuwait.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Losing is never easy.
