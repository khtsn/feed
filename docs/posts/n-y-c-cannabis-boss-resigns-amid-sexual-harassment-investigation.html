She added, “If it was a man, people would understand what the problem was.”</p><p>Ms. Washington said the proposed relationship also involved a former business partner, a woman whom she and Ms. Dawson were both dating.</p><p>An investigator planned to interview Ms. Dawson about the complaint, according to Memphis Washington, Ms. Washington’s sibling and a partner in Repot Box, who was interviewed by the investigator on March 10.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In her statement, Ms. Dawson said she “carried out my role with integrity.”</p><p>“The allegations were fabricated and contradict everything I stand for and the professional reputation I’ve built over many years,” she said.</p><p>Her departure was <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/03/27/build-baby-build-00253074" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported by Politico</a>.</p><p>Ms. Washington said she initially filed a complaint last spring with the city’s Department of Investigation, but it was referred to the Department of Small Business Services, which oversees Cannabis NYC.</p><p>The current status of the case is unclear. Small Business Services declined to confirm or deny that there had been an E.E.O. complaint, citing confidentiality, but said it takes all allegations seriously. The agency also thanked Ms. Dawson “for her service to the city’s community of cannabis entrepreneurs.”</p><p>Ms. Dawson was the first director of Cannabis NYC, which was created in 2022 to streamline city services to help people find jobs and open businesses in the nascent legal industry. In her resignation letter, Ms. Dawson listed the program’s achievements.</p><p>“We’ve shared a common goal: to build a new cannabis market that is equitable, accessible, sustainable and safe,” she said. “Together, we have not only laid the groundwork for a thriving legal industry in New York City, but also implemented groundbreaking and impactful initiatives that have set a new precedent for cannabis policy and practice nationwide.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She stepped into the role in October 2022 to fight stigma against cannabis that she said was stifling dialogue about how it could be used safely and to empower communities battered in the war on drugs. In office, she led an educational tour through the five boroughs, helped to start a cannabis job-training program for people who have been arrested and oversaw the creation of an $8 million business loan program for the first wave of licensed dispensaries opening in the city.</p><p>Though she was a city official, Ms. Dawson was a vociferous defender of the state’s rollout of recreational cannabis. She said it had come together as quickly as those of other states in the Northeast that had not prioritized small businesses and Black and brown neighborhoods where arrests for marijuana were disproportionately high. When lawsuits held up dispensary openings, she helped to organize cannabis farmers’ markets in the city that helped to sell off some of the state’s harvest.</p><p>Ms. Dawson did not disclose what she plans to do next, but said in her resignation letter that she wanted to expand her impact at the state and federal level.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>In the Ring, His Parents’ Money Doesn’t Matter:</strong> Sean O’Bradaigh grew up in a world of Manhattan privilege, but private schools and ski vacations have nothing on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/in-the-ring-it-doesnt-matter-how-much-money-his-parents-have.html">dream of being a professional boxer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Subway Ninja’:</strong> In the lowest moment of Selwyn Bernardez’s life, he attacked a stranger with a sword.
