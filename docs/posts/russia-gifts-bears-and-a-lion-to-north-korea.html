    <h1>Russia Gifts Bears and a Lion to North Korea</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>That gift is the latest sign of the tightening bond between the two nations, an alliance that has become increasingly visible over the past few months. In June, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/world/asia/putin-meets-kim-north-korea.html" title="">revived a Cold War-era mutual defense pledge</a> and, according to the Pentagon, more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine.html" title="">10,000 North Korean troops</a> are in Russia in the Kursk region, where intense fighting against Ukrainian forces has been taking place since August.</p><p>Under Kim Jong-un’s rule, the humanitarian crisis in North Korea has deepened in the past decade after the expansion of the country’s military arsenal led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/world/asia/north-korea-food-shortage.html" title="">stricter international sanctions</a>. North Korea also suffered badly from the Covid-19 pandemic and flooding over the past few years, leaving it in dire need of money as well as basic goods.</p><p>American officials have been concerned that in return for sending his troops to Russia, Mr. Kim <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/europe/north-korean-troops-arrive-kursk-russia.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">might receive military assistance</a> that would enhance the danger it poses to South Korea and the United States. Experts say improving the range of his intercontinental ballistic missiles is on Mr. Kim’s agenda. It is not clear if Russia has provided any aid of that kind, or has plans to do so.</p><p>Animals have long played a role in reinforcing political ties. China has for decades <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/15/world/asia/pandas-zoo-breeding-death-captivity.html" title="">been presenting pandas to zoos</a> in countries including Finland, Japan and South Korea. In October, two pandas from China were sent to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/pandas-china-national-zoo.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">Smithsonian National Zoo</a> in Washington, D.C. China has sent pandas to North Korea on multiple occasions going back <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/panda/37969.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as early as 1965</a>, according to Chinese state media, although the most recent time it did so is unclear.</p><p>Mr. Kim has also used animals as tokens of friendship. In 2018, he gave a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/world/asia/korea-dogs-president.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">pair of white Pungsans</a>, a breed of dog native to North Korea, to Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president at the time. Mr. Moon received the dogs during a visit to Pyongyang for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/world/asia/moon-jae-in-pyongyang-kim-jong-un-summit.html" title="">summit talks</a>, though relations between the neighboring countries have soured since.</p></div></div>
