    <h1>Jerome Powell Dismisses Idea of Trump Firing Him</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Would Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, step aside if asked to do so by President-elect Donald J. Trump? Mr. Powell had a one-word answer on Thursday: “No.”</p><p>Could Mr. Trump fire or demote him if he refuses to go? Same answer.</p><p>Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Powell to his post in 2018 but soon soured on him when he resisted the then-president’s calls to lower interest rates. He considered firing or demoting Mr. Powell, but his advisers concluded that doing so would be <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-knows-he-can-t-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell-n951426" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">difficult if not impossible</a>.</p><p>Since leaving office, Mr. Trump has continued to criticize the Fed, leading to speculation that he could try again to fire Mr. Powell — or pressure him to resign.</p><p>Asked about those possibilities on Thursday, Mr. Powell said directly that he would not leave if Mr. Trump asked him to resign, and that the president did not have the power to push him out before his term as chair ends in May 2026. He declined to elaborate.</p></div></div>
