    <h1>Facing Pushback, Trump Threatened More Tariffs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>This morning, President Trump issued a new ultimatum to China. He promised to impose an additional 50 percent fee on all imports of Chinese goods — bringing them to a total of 104 percent — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/economy/trump-china-tariffs-threat.html" title="">unless Beijing agreed to rescind its retaliatory tariffs</a>. He said the U.S. would not negotiate until China backed down.</p><p>The move seemed designed to send a message that the president remained committed to his trade war, even if it meant higher prices for Americans. Asked this afternoon about a potential pause on tariffs, Trump said, “We’re not looking at that.”</p><p>U.S. stock markets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/07/business/trump-tariffs-stock-market" title="">swung wildly</a>. At one point, the S&amp;P 500 fell as much as 4.7 percent; then, it briefly rallied to a 3.4 percent gain after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/economy/trump-tariffs-no-pause-stock-market.html" title="">false report about a tariff reprieve</a>. The index ended the day down 0.2 percent, 17.6 percent below its February peak.</p><p>One of Wall Street’s most influential leaders, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, warned that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/economy/jamie-dimon-letter-tariffs.html" title="">stock prices might still be too high</a>. In a letter to shareholders, he said that Trump’s tariffs were likely to increase inflation and slow the American economy, echoing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/business/stock-market-plunge-investment-bank-impact.html" title="">growing anxiety</a> on Wall Street.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-b8b104d">Roberts halted an order to return a wrongly deported man</h2><p>John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, temporarily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/supreme-court-wrongly-deported.html" title="">blocked a judge’s order directing the Trump administration to secure the return</a> of a migrant it had mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The judge, who gave the administration a deadline of midnight tonight, had called the deportation a “grievous error” that “shocks the conscience.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Roberts, acting on his own, issued an administrative stay, an interim measure meant to give the justices time while the full court considers the matter. In a response to the court, the migrant’s lawyers said their client “sits in a foreign prison solely at the behest of the United States, as the product of a Kafka-esque mistake.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump in the Oval Office today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-4fd04354">Trump said the U.S. would soon hold nuclear talks with Iran</h2><p>Trump said this afternoon that senior U.S. officials would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran on Saturday for the first time in a decade. The president characterized the discussions as an effort to rein in Tehran’s nuclear program, and he said that Iran would be “in great danger” if the talks were not successful.</p><p>Three Iranian officials with knowledge of the plans characterized them differently, saying that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/07/us/trump-news/685f3402-3380-58c3-91b5-d627b246133d?smid=url-share" title="">indirect talks were planned for Saturday</a>, and that Iran would be open to direct talks if they went well.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shirley Bodkin said she was sexually abused by the staff at a Los Angeles County foster facility decades ago.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-2153d769">A record settlement after ‘childhoods of pure hell’</h2><p>Los Angeles County agreed this month to pay $4 billion to settle lawsuits brought by nearly 7,000 people who said they were sexually abused as children in the county’s juvenile detention and foster systems.
