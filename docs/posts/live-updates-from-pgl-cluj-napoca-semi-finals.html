                        <p><strong>XTQZZZ on the close Mirage finish:</strong> &#34;They are really good on the map. We had a good plan, we played together, but they were better than us at the beginning of the game. I had a good feeling on the T side because we stayed calm, we had solutions. We had time between the groups and playoffs because we couldn&#39;t after Krakow. It was a really good game and we knew if we took Mirage, it was a good game for us for us.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On PARIVISION tomorrow:</strong> &#34;Honestly, we are really happy because finally we will play a new opponent in the grand final. When we saw the result, we were like, &#39;Oh, it could be cool to play a new opponent.&#39; We know Jame&#39;s system, it&#39;s gonna be a hard game. Yes, of course, we watched them, but now it&#39;s time to see which map I can pick against them. They are really good on CT side, it&#39;s tough to read them, so it&#39;s gonna be huge prep tonight and a bit tomorrow. I&#39;m excited to play against them.&#34;</p>
