    <h1>With New FX Sitcom ‘English Teacher,’ Brian Jordan Alvarez Takes Another Leap</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>For over a decade, Brian Jordan Alvarez has been bootstrapping his way across platforms and screens big and small, collecting fans and followers.</p><p>In the early days, he starred with friends in short comedic sketches he posted on YouTube. Then in 2016, on a paltry budget of around $10,000, he created “The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo,” a five-part comedy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAumukunDCqfi1CmaOM20f2jzQtKIP7rt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">web series</a> about a misfit group of queer friends in Los Angeles. Alvarez wrote and directed it, and starred as the title character.</p><p>“Caleb Gallo” quickly found an audience. It was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival that year, earned a Gotham Award nomination and topped <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/best-of/best-web-series-2016-jerry-seinfeld-demetri-martin-1201758293/#:~:text=1.,Wondrous%20Life%20of%20Caleb%20Gallo%E2%80%9C" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IndieWire’s</a> list of best web series of 2016, edging out Jerry Seinfeld’s “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.” The next year, Alvarez landed a recurring role in the three-season revival of “Will &amp; Grace,” as the fiancé, then husband, of Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In 2023 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/arts/breakout-stars-2023-music-tv-movies.html" title="">he leveled up</a> again, starring alongside Allison Williams in the horror comedy <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1110147841/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">box office smash</a> “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/movies/megan-review.html" title="">M3gan</a>” and reaching new heights of virality with a stable of absurdist face-filtered characters. The most famous of them, the bug-eyed, duck-lipped pop star TJ Mack, delighted millions on TikTok and Instagram with the earworm “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxTLqY0RS1J/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=6837abf9-a600-415b-9aa3-2bffafe21ed7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sitting</a>” (pronounced “Sittim”).</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/31/multimedia/30alvarez-02-fpqg/30alvarez-02-fpqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/31/multimedia/30alvarez-02-fpqg/30alvarez-02-fpqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/31/multimedia/30alvarez-02-fpqg/30alvarez-02-fpqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A man clasps his hands together, standing in front of a blackboard" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/31/multimedia/30alvarez-02-fpqg/30alvarez-02-fpqg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/31/multimedia/30alvarez-02-fpqg/30alvarez-02-fpqg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/31/multimedia/30alvarez-02-fpqg/30alvarez-02-fpqg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/31/multimedia/30alvarez-02-fpqg/30alvarez-02-fpqg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alvarez plays an English teacher at a high school in Austin, Texas, who is navigating relationships and discussions of hot-button topics.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Richard Ducree/FX</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Now Alvarez is taking another major leap: “English Teacher,” a feel-good sitcom with an edge that he created and stars in, debuts on FX on Sept. 2.</p><p>“I am this sort of hybrid, you know, or maybe I’m just an artist at work,” he said in a video interview from New Zealand, where he was filming the sequel to “M3gan.”</p><p>The sitcom stars Alvarez as Evan Marquez, a stubborn but charming English teacher at a high school in Austin, Texas, where he navigates relationships with friends, colleagues, students and their parents. The cast includes comics and character actors like Enrico Colantoni, Sean Patton and Carmen Christopher as well as Stephanie Koenig, Alvarez’s longtime collaborator and close friend, as Gwen Sanders, Evan’s best friend and fellow teacher.</p><p>“English Teacher” joins a growing canon of hopeful-mentor sitcoms that includes “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/arts/television/abbott-elementary.html" title="">Abbott Elementary</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/ted-lasso" title="">Ted Lasso</a>.” (Its language and themes keep it firmly in the TV-MA realm, though.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alvarez played the partner of Jack (Sean Hayes) in the reboot of “Will &amp; Grace.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Haston/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“English Teacher” diverges from those shows by marrying laughs with hot-button topics: In the second episode, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/11/arts/television/trixie-mattel-drag-race.html" title="">Trixie Mattel</a> (perhaps the most famous drag artist in the world aside from RuPaul) guest stars as a “drag football coach”; the fourth episode focuses on guns in schools; and throughout the season, Evan grapples with what it means to be a gay educator in the South.</p><p>The show strives to not be preachy and mostly avoids hammering home any specific points of view. The perspectives of the students are as central as those of the teachers, creating a kind of ongoing conversation about so-called woke and anti-woke dynamics.</p><p>Alvarez, 37, was born in Manhattan but was raised primarily in Tennessee, which informed the show’s Texas setting.</p><p>“I have a lot of love for the South,” he said. “I also sort of knew, well, my mom’s Colombian, so we’re not quite from here. So I think you can feel that in the show, too.”</p><p>His mother is also an educator, as is his sister, and he’s had a lifelong affinity for teaching.</p><p>“It’s sort of in my blood, and I’ve never done it,” he said. “It’s that thing where somebody says, ‘I’m not a doctor, but I play one on TV.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A school is also an ideal setting for a TV show, he said, because it’s a snapshot of the larger world.</p><p>“This particular environment is such a good opportunity to put people together who normally wouldn’t choose to interact,” he said. “People from every different part of life are forced to come together — and not just come together, but come together for a common purpose of educating these kids.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alvarez also appeared in the hit horror comedy “M3gan,” with Jen Van Epps, left, and Allison Williams.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Geoffrey Short/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>While a big focus in the writers’ room was how to talk about risky topics, the show’s warmth comes from the core friendships. That is one of Alvarez’s signature moves, going back to his early web video days, Koenig said.</p><p>“It’s a product of him growing up with movies in the ’80s and being a big fan of ‘Dirty Dancing’ and feel-good movies like ‘Ghost’ and ‘Sister Act,’ where there’s always a good ending,” she said in a video interview from her Los Angeles home.</p><p>Koenig, who also played Alvarez’s best friend in “Caleb Gallo,” met him while they were both in their early 20s. She was new to Los Angeles and was struggling to land acting jobs when she met Alvarez through a friend who was making a short student film.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>After their first meeting, Koenig recalled, she felt that “I met a co-partner, somebody who really made me feel inspired.” They worked together steadily from then on, strengthening both their friendship and their craft.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stephanie Koenig, front left, who has worked with Alvarez for years, plays a fellow teacher and best friend to his character in “English Teacher.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Steve Swisher/FX</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>“</strong>We became each other’s muses,” said Koenig, who has also recently starred in the Apple TV+ drama “Lessons in Chemistry” and the Max thriller “The Flight Attendant.”</p><p>Koenig says that Alvarez’s trick is to always push a joke or a story into an unexpected place, no matter the project or the medium.</p><p>“It’s never a take that everybody else would see,” she said. “It always takes a left turn and keeps surprising you.”</p><p>Alvarez and Koenig heaped praise onto the entire cast and crew of “English Teacher.” Alvarez said his fellow executive producers, Paul Simms, Jonathan Krisel and Dave King, empowered him to lead his first full-fledged TV series while ensuring he maintained the distinct comedic sensibility that his online fans, especially, have grown attached to.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Each step along the way, I would check in and say, ‘This still does have that essence, that golden thread at the center,’” Alvarez said.</p><p>Creating a show for a major cable network wasn’t without its jitters. When Alvarez felt them mostly acutely, he’d remind himself: “I’ve had enough amateur practice rounds of this to know what I’m doing.”</p><p>“I think the hardest part is how early the calls are,” he said, with a laugh. “I have to be at my own set at 5 a.m. Can I tell someone to make this 9 a.m.?”</p><p>He worries less about the distinctions between online video and the more traditional format of a sitcom. “I’ve had different audiences at different times,” he said. “This again is just a different audience.”</p><p>“There were people that used to watch my YouTube sketches who then years later would say, ‘Oh, I didn’t realize you were on TikTok,’” he explained. “And there are people that are into these TikTok characters I do that go, ‘Oh, I didn’t know you used to do YouTube videos.’”</p><p>As for the future of his characters like TJ Mack, anything is possible, he said.</p><p>“It’d be fun to make them into their own sort of sketch TV show or something adjacent to that, but I’m also happy with how it is right now,” he added. “As long as you guys are entertained by this, then good.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maya Salam is an editor and reporter, focusing primarily on pop culture across genres.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>C</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Hard Topics Approached With Humor<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Comedy</h2><hr/><ul><li><p>Here are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/arts/adam-sandler-love-you-netflix-special.html">3 stand-up specials to stream</a>, including Adam Sandler’s ‘Love You,’ which feels like a sequel to the film ‘Uncut Gems,” according to our writer.</p></li><li><p>Conner O’Malley, a cult hero in the comedy world, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/arts/conner-omalley-comedian.html">specializes in desperately ambitious men</a> doomed to fail.
