But it will mark the beginning of the end of an era, after more than two years in which central bankers lifted borrowing costs to a two-decade high and then held them there in a bid to slow the economy and bring rapid price increases under control.</p><p>Policymakers will also release a fresh set of economic projections on Wednesday, their first since June. Investors will closely watch those estimates for any hint at how quickly interest rates are expected to fall later this year and into next. And Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, will hold a news conference after the central bank’s 2 p.m. announcement, which will offer another window into future policy.</p><p>Here’s what to watch as the Fed gathers for one of its most consequential meetings in years.</p><h3 id="link-6b03fdb"><span>Investors are focused on how big a cut.</span></h3><p>There’s almost no question that the Fed is going to lower interest rates on Wednesday. Even its more inflation-sensitive officials have signaled that it is time to start cuts as they try to balance their two big goals — to keep inflation stable and the job market strong.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For years, the Fed has focused mainly on prices, which were jumping out of control. But inflation has been coming down steadily. The Consumer Price Index measure clocked in at 2.5 percent in August, down from 9.1 percent in the summer of 2022. That’s still a bit quicker than the 2 percent that was normal before the pandemic, but the trend is clearly headed in the right direction.</p><p>At the same time, the labor market has shown signs of cooling meaningfully. Unemployment has picked up to 4.2 percent, notably higher than its low of 3.4 percent last year. Hiring is slower, and there are fewer jobs to go around.</p><p>Given that combination, Fed officials want to begin lowering interest rates, which is akin to taking a foot off the economic brake. But the question is how much they should ease up.</p><p>“It’s a very, very finely balanced call,” said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price.</p><p>There’s an argument for adjusting policy just slightly. Lowering interest rates by a quarter point would start to take the pressure off the economy. But moving patiently and deliberatively would also avoid spurring a big economic acceleration — one that could keep prices rising, causing inflation to remain slightly too quick for comfort.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But there’s also a case for cutting rates by a bigger-than-usual half point this month. Lowering rates quickly could send a clear signal that the Fed stands ready to protect the job market, and lower borrowing costs could cushion the economy against more of a slowdown.</p><p>“I think there’s this idea that — they do some insurance cuts now,” Ms. Uruci said. “I think that needs to be accompanied by a clear statement that you’re not starting a series of half point cuts, because the economy doesn’t look that weak.”</p><h3 id="link-39ebadb2"><span>Fed officials will also use estimates to communicate.</span></h3><p>Even if Fed officials opt for a smaller rate cut this time around, they are likely to communicate that there are more to come. The Fed meets again in November and December.</p><p>Officials will release an estimate of how much rates are expected to come down by the end of the year, along with projections for the next several years, in their economic forecasts on Wednesday.</p><p>Market pricing suggests that investors expect Fed officials to cut borrowing costs by a full percentage point or more by the end of the year. A full point of reductions would be the equivalent of one big move and two small ones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A key question is how much officials expect interest rates to fall in the longer term. Central bankers have marked up their long-run interest rate estimate over the past year as growth proved stronger than expected, but they have voiced uncertainty about exactly where borrowing costs will end up.</p><p>The answer matters: For consumers and businesses, it will inform how much mortgage rates and business loan rates eventually come down.</p><p>For now, most economists do not expect a return to the rock-bottom rates of the 2010s and 2020. That is partly because those super-low borrowing costs came as the Fed cut interest rates to near-zero and held them there to try to reverse deep recessions and a tepid economic recovery. The economy is in better shape these days, which means that rates are likely to stay higher.</p><h3 id="link-39d63e4d"><span>The Fed chair’s comments will also be in focus.</span></h3><p>Mr. Powell will hold a news conference after the release of the Fed’s policy statement and economic projections, and investors are sure to follow his every word for both an explanation of the Fed’s September decision and a hint at what might come next.</p><p>Mr. Powell’s “key communications challenge is to assure everyone that the Fed is not falling behind the curve,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Fed chair has been clear in recent public remarks that he does not want to see the job market slow further, and that the central bank is prepared to react if it does.</p><p>The months ahead will be critical in determining whether Mr. Powell and his colleagues have managed to coax inflation lower without severely hurting the economy in the process. Economic soft landings are rare, and pulling one off after roaring inflation would be a first in the United States.</p><p>Still, Mr. Powell has voiced optimism that it could happen.</p><p>“With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labor market,” Mr. Powell said in <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his latest speech</a>.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
