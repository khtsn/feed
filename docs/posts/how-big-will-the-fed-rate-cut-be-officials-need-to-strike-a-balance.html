But it will mark the beginning of the end of an era, after more than two years in which central bankers lifted borrowing costs to a two-decade high and then held them there in a bid to slow the economy and bring rapid price increases under control.</p><div><p>Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, will hold a news conference after the central bank’s 2 p.m. announcement, which will offer another window into future policy. Officials will also release a fresh set of economic projections, their first since June. Investors will closely watch those estimates for any hint at how quickly interest rates are expected to fall later this year and into next.</p><p>Here’s what to watch as the Fed gathers for one of its most consequential meetings in years:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A shift in focus:</strong> For years, the Fed has focused mainly on prices, which were jumping out of control. But inflation has been coming down steadily. At the same time, the labor market has shown signs of cooling meaningfully. Given that combination, Fed officials want to begin lowering interest rates, which is akin to taking a foot off the economic brake, but the question is how much they should ease up.</p></li><li><p><strong>The case for a smaller cut:</strong> Lowering interest rates by a quarter point would start to take the pressure off the economy. But moving patiently and deliberatively would also avoid spurring a big economic acceleration — one that could keep prices rising, causing inflation to remain slightly too quick for comfort.</p></li><li><p><strong>The case for a bigger cut:</strong> Lowering rates quickly, by a half a point, could send a clear signal that the Fed stands ready to protect the job market, and lower borrowing costs could cushion the economy against more of a slowdown.</p></li><li><p><strong>The first of many cuts:</strong> Officials will also release an estimate of how much rates are expected to come down by the end of the year, along with projections for the next several years, in their economic forecasts on Wednesday. Market pricing suggests that investors expect Fed officials to cut borrowing costs by a full percentage point or more by the end of the year. The Fed meets again in November and December.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chair Powell speaks: </strong>Mr. Powell will hold a news conference after the release of the Fed’s policy statement and economic projections, and investors are sure to follow his every word for both an explanation of the Fed’s September decision and a hint at what might come next. The months ahead will be critical in determining whether the Fed chair and his colleagues have managed to coax inflation lower without severely hurting the economy in the process. Economic “soft landings” are rare, and pulling one off after roaring inflation would be a first in the United States.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdmNmQ4MGUzLTAyYjctNTljYi04Y2RjLTkyOWJkYWYzMzU1NQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/business/fed-interest-rates#trump-interest-rates" data-source-id="100000009700027"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeanna-smialek"><img alt="Jeanna Smialek" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T16:15:06.271Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J. Trump speaking at a news conference in California last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Federal Reserve officials do not answer to the White House and they insist that they do not take politics into account when they are setting interest rates. But because borrowing costs have a big effect on the economy and the nation’s economic vibe, the central bank’s decision on Wednesday is sure to draw political attention.</p><p>Former President Donald J. Trump regularly promises to bring interest rates down if he is elected president again — even though the president has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/trump-economics-gas-tariffs-inflation.html" title="">little to no</a> direct impact on borrowing costs. While in office he publicly railed against the Fed for taking too long to cut rates, to little avail.</p><div><p>And Mr. Trump has remained focused on the Fed as it approaches its first rate cut in more than four years.</p><p>“You’ll see, they’ll do the interest rate cut and all of the political stuff tomorrow,” Mr. Trump said during <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538384-1/fmr-pres-trump-town-hall-flint-mi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a town hall</a> in Michigan this week. “Will he do a half a point? Will he do a quarter of a point? But the reason is that the economy is not good. Otherwise you wouldn’t be able to do it.”</p><p>In fact, Mr. Trump has suggested repeatedly that it would be political of the Fed to cut borrowing costs in the weeks leading up to the election. Rate cuts are “something that they know they shouldn’t be doing,” he told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview-transcript/?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> earlier this year. At <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-says-wouldnt-reappoint-fed-chair-powell-political" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another point</a> he told Fox News that lower rates would “help the Democrats.” He has since suggested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/economy/trump-fed-interest-rates.html" title="">that</a> presidents should “have a say” on interest rates, though he later <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/business/trump-federal-reserve-independence/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">walked the comment back</a>.</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has largely avoided talking about the Fed. While President Biden steers clear of saying what the Fed should do, he has at times tiptoed close to doing so, including <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4585927-biden-inflation-interest-rate-cut/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier this year</a> when he said he “bet” that interest rates were going to come down.</p><p>The rhetoric underscores a reality. The party in power — in this case, Democrats — often stands to benefit from lower Fed rates.</p><p>In today’s instance, a decision to lower borrowing costs would signal that the Fed is winning its battle against rapid inflation and would make it cheaper and easier for families to borrow money to buy a house or start a business. That combination could make consumers feel better about the economy, at least around the edges, as they head for the polls in November.</p><p>But the Fed says that it does not take such considerations into account when it is thinking about interest rates.</p><p>Fed board members are appointed by the White House and confirmed by the Senate, but once they are in place, they are insulated from political pressures. It is difficult — if <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-happens-if-trump-tries-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not impossible</a> — to remove key Fed officials, and the president has no say on interest rate decisions.</p><p>There’s a reason for that independence. Historical and global experience has shown that central banks that are free to make hard decisions — like keeping rates high to choke off inflation during an election year — achieve better results that keep the economy on a more stable footing in the long run. Politicized central banks can incur problems like runaway inflation.</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s comments have worried some economists, who are concerned that the Fed’s independence could come under assault if he is elected in November.</p><p>There are several paths to influencing Fed policy. Mr. Trump could try to appoint officials who would be more likely to follow his lead. The leadership term for <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/jerome-h-powell" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jerome H. Powell</a>, the Fed chair, expires in 2026. Another Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, will also see her <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/kugler.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">term lapse</a> that year. That could leave the next president with seats to fill.</p><p>He could also pursue other approaches. He could complain about Fed policy publicly, as he did in his term in office, when he called central bank officials “boneheads” and likened Mr. Powell to a bad golfer. And he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/business/economy/trump-federal-reserve.html" title="">could try to pull</a> at least some aspects of the Fed’s job — like bank regulation — closer to the White House.</p><p>For now, politicians are likely to have little sway over how the Fed is approaching policy. But that won’t keep them from talking about it in the weeks to come.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWRlMDNlMjQtOTMyMi01NzMzLTkxZTctNWEyYWU0MGQ4NzIz"><div id="ade03e24-9322-5733-91e7-5a2ae40d8723" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/business/fed-interest-rates#ade03e24-9322-5733-91e7-5a2ae40d8723"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye"><img alt="Danielle Kaye" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-danielle-kaye/author-danielle-kaye-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-danielle-kaye/author-danielle-kaye-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-danielle-kaye/author-danielle-kaye-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T16:01:26.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 12:01 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Stocks are inching down as investors brace for the Fed’s rate cut decision in a couple of hours.

Policymakers have lowered inflation within sight of their targets and are now trying to delicately steer their economies toward a so-called soft landing. They want to avoid keeping rates too high for too long and causing excessive damage, such as a jump in unemployment, to economies that have already been weakened by high interest rates.</p><div><p>Still, these officials have been wary of declaring victory too early. With stubbornly high inflation in the services sector and relatively strong wage growth, they have lowered interest rates slowly. Last week, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/business/european-central-bank-interest-rates.html" title="">European Central Bank cut rates</a> for the second time in three months and traders expect officials in the eurozone to wait until December before lowering rates again.</p><p>On Wednesday, inflation in Britain held at 2.2 percent in August, but policymakers at the Bank of England are expected to keep rates steady this week, having cut them already last month. Officials in Britain have said inflation has slowed enough to cut rates, which has brought some relief to mortgage holders and companies that need loans, but they are not confident that inflationary pressures have been completely stamped out.</p><p>Similarly, central banks in Norway and Sweden are also expected to hold rates at their meetings later in September, as they emphasize their gradual approach. The Swiss National Bank is expected to continue its quarterly interest rate cuts, which it started in March, when its officials meet later this month.</p><p>Policymakers “are pretty confident in the direction of travel for rates, that these need to come down, but that they need to be cautious,” said Katharine Neiss, an economist at PGIM Fixed Income, an asset manager.</p><p>The pivot at the Fed to cut rates will have important ripple effects as it eases global financial conditions, Ms. Neiss added. If the Fed makes an outsize cut on Wednesday, it could also “open up the space for European policymakers, including the U.K., that they could then cut more aggressively as well,” she said. That would most likely happen next year once the remnants of the energy price shock disperse and policymakers have a clearer sense of what price pressures are left.</p><p>But there are outliers around the rest of the world. Many countries took an aggressive response to the inflation shock after the pandemic, while the Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-easy monetary policy, hoping to engineer the kind of steady long-term inflation the Japanese economy needed. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/business/japan-inflation-rates.html" title="">as rising prices stung Japanese households</a> and did not help businesses as expected, the central bank broke with its posture, raising rates in July for only the second time in nearly two decades.</p><p>In emerging markets, central banks are moving in different directions. Brazil’s central bank is expected to raise rates on Thursday for the first time in two years. Brazilian officials began their easing cycle in August 2023 as inflation slowed toward their target. But now, they are expected to reverse course as economic growth picks up and brings with it fears of a resurgence in inflation. Central bankers in Mexico are expected to continue rate cuts, and the central bank in South Africa is expected to cut rates on Thursday for the first time since the pandemic.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOTMzM2NhMjktZDgyNy01ZDNjLWEyNDQtMWI3MDlmYTcxZTQy"><div id="9333ca29-d827-5d3c-a244-1b709fa71e42" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/business/fed-interest-rates#9333ca29-d827-5d3c-a244-1b709fa71e42"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeanna-smialek"><img alt="Jeanna Smialek" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/reader-center/author-jeanna-smialek/author-jeanna-smialek-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T15:59:11.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 11:59 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years today.

The price of gasoline has fallen <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">below $3 a gallon</a> in much of the South and Midwest and is <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GASREGW" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearing a three-year low</a> nationally. Spiking grocery prices have <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1tQuL" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slowed to a crawl</a>. Mortgage rates are <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1tQuS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">down more than a percentage point</a> from their recent peak. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/business/economy/poverty-report-2023-census-bureau.html" title="">The Census Bureau reported last week</a> that the typical household income rose faster than prices last year for the first time since the pandemic. The overall inflation rate has <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1tQv8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">returned to near historically normal</a> levels, and the Fed is poised to begin cutting interest rates from a two-decade high.</p><p>The Biden administration, which has taken heat from Republicans and many economists for fueling inflation with its economic policies, has begun to celebrate those developments in bold terms. Officials are claiming vindication for their multi-trillion-dollar efforts to boost households and businesses in their recovery from the pandemic recession.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/09/17/beating-the-forecasts-how-the-us-economy-defied-expectations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a blog post on Tuesday</a> highlighting economic and job growth under Mr. Biden that has surpassed projections. Lael Brainard, who heads Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council, told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Monday that the American economy has now reached a “turning point.”</p><p>“A few years ago, many were convinced that the combination of a large decline in inflation with a sustained expansion that we are seeing today couldn’t happen,” she said.</p><p>Aides to the president have been pointing toward this inflection point for more than a year. They were confident that Fed cuts would help push down mortgage rates and send voters a powerful message that the worst of the inflation fight was over.</p><p>And yet, administration officials concede those gains have come months later than they had hoped and possibly too close to the election to dislodge long-hardened voter concerns over inflation under the Biden-Harris administration.</p><p>They also acknowledge that the rise in prices on Mr. Biden’s watch, including on necessities like food and housing, continues to burden families. The Council of Economic Advisers noted in a separate post last week that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/09/11/the-role-of-housing-in-u-s-inflation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">housing price increases continue to play</a> an outsized role in overall inflation — a challenge unlikely to be solved quickly, and which is likely to necessitate new policy measures to encourage home building.</p><p>As a result, there is little consensus about how much the recent economic news might buoy some voters as they cast ballots in November’s presidential race. Former President Donald J. Trump has relentlessly attacked the Biden administration, including Ms. Harris, for soaring prices.</p><p>Economists disagree on the impact of the rate cut, now that it appears to finally be arriving.</p><p>Josh Bivens, the chief economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said he would guess “it’s a very, very small slice of people who would recognize this kind of symbolic importance of the cut” for the economy and the administration’s stewardship of it.</p><p>It is possible, he added, that the Fed waited so long to cut rates that it has “denied the Harris campaign this advantage for a long enough time that its force now is almost totally eroded.”</p><p>R. Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University economist who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and has advised Republican presidential candidates, said a quarter-point cut might not cause a ripple in American politics.</p><p>But a larger rate cut, of half a percentage point, could signal reason to worry for consumers, he said.</p><p>In what could be a potential argument from Mr. Trump and other Republicans, Mr. Hubbard said that a decision to cut rates by half a percentage point “could be argued to represent a significantly weakening economy with potential political ramifications.”</p><p>Others say the cuts could have real benefits for Americans’ lives, and that they could set off a run of positive media coverage about the era of high inflation coming to an end, both of which could benefit Ms. Harris.</p><p>“For the millions of Americans who can’t pay cash for a house or a car, or who can’t always pay off their credit card bill in full, cuts will provide real relief,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the liberal Groundwork Collaborative in Washington. “I absolutely expect this to translate into a boost in consumer sentiment, and upticks in sentiment will benefit Harris.”</p><p><a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consumer expectations for the economy</a> improved in August, according to the University of Michigan, and have risen more than 10 percent from last year. But <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sentiment overall remains low</a> by historical terms and is down from the start of Mr. Biden’s term.</p><p>Polls typically show Mr. Trump leading Ms. Harris on economic issues, though the gap has closed since she replaced Mr. Biden as the Democratic nominee. Neither the Harris nor Trump campaigns would comment this week on a potential Fed move and its implications for the economy. But a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, criticized Ms. Harris for her administration’s record on borrowing costs.</p><p>“Kamalanomics has led to the fastest increase in mortgage rates since 1981, and only President Trump can restore economic growth after four years of failure,” she said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RhNjMxZTZhLWEwN2ItNTc4OS1iMDYwLWQ0YTZhN2IxN2FiYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/business/fed-interest-rates#stock-market-fed-rate-cut" data-source-id="100000009698094"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison"><img alt="Joe Rennison" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-18T09:04:30.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 18, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="stocks-fed" data-id="100000009703055" data-source-id="100000009703055"><div data-sourceid="100000009703055" id="embed-id-100000009703055">
      
    

<p>Percentage change in S&amp;P 500 this year</p>
</div></section><p>Investors have set their hopes on a big cut in interest rates, an expectation that gave new life to the stock market’s rally and shows how pivotal the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday will be to sentiment in the financial markets.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose for the seventh straight day on Tuesday, bolstered by economic data and rising expectations that the Fed will cut rates by half of a percentage point, double the typical quarter-point adjustment the central bank typically makes. The rally has left the index just 0.6 percent from surpassing its record high set in July.</p><div><p>The Nasdaq Composite index, which is chock-full of tech stocks deemed to be among the most sensitive companies to rate changes, has climbed over 5 percent since early September and sits about 5 percent below its July peak. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies has also moved more than 5 percent higher over the same period, leaving it less than 3 percent away from its July record.</p><p>The gains have come with traders in futures markets indicating that they think a half-point cut — even if an unusually big move — <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is the most likely outcome on Wednesday</a>. That’s a big shift in thinking from just a few weeks ago.</p><p>Lower rates (all else being equal) would be supportive to the stock market, easing borrowing costs for companies and increasing the value of investors’ holdings.</p><p>But it also matters why rates are being cut. If the Fed is cutting rates aggressively because policymakers are worried about the economy, stock prices are likely to slide. Right now, the hope among investors seems to be that the Fed will act fast so it can stay ahead of any potential economic weakness.</p><p>“I think investors are hopeful they get the best of both worlds,” said Alan McKnight, chief investment officer at Regions Bank.</p><p>There are some signs of caution among investors. The gains in recent weeks have been led by real estate and utilities, with the former seen as a primary beneficiary of lower rates and the latter a more defensive bet as the economy slows. The technology stocks that led the market rally for so many years have slipped over the past month.</p><p>Andrzej Skiba, head of U.S. fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management, said he did not see the case for a larger rate cut with the economy still in solid shape. But, he added, not all investors are in agreement at the moment.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRiMzIzMTBhLTQ0NzUtNWRhYS1hNTEzLWY1OGVmY2E1NGZkNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/business/fed-interest-rates#fed-rates-mortgages-car-loans" data-source-id="100000009691234"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ron-lieber"><img alt="Ron Lieber" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/multimedia/author-ron-lieber/author-ron-lieber-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/multimedia/author-ron-lieber/author-ron-lieber-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/multimedia/author-ron-lieber/author-ron-lieber-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tara-siegel-bernard"><img alt="Tara Siegel Bernard" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/multimedia/author-tara-siegel-bernard/author-tara-siegel-bernard-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/multimedia/author-tara-siegel-bernard/author-tara-siegel-bernard-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/multimedia/author-tara-siegel-bernard/author-tara-siegel-bernard-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T09:04:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kyle Ellingson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The moment consumers have been waiting for is finally here: The Federal Reserve is poised to cut its key interest rate on Wednesday, and it’s likely to signal that more cuts will follow.</p><p>The only question is how much rates will decline from their current perch of around 5.33 percent, with some economists saying they could drop by as much as a full percentage point before the end of the year.

But dealerships are offering more incentives and discounts to attract buyers, and that’s expected to continue.</p><p>Car loans tend to track with the yield on the five-year Treasury note, which is influenced by the Fed’s key rate.

Always negotiate on the price of the car (including all fees), not the monthly payments, which can obscure the loan terms and what you’ll be paying in total over the life of the loan.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Consumers looking for deals on credit cards should seek out smaller banks and credit unions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mario Tama/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-59ab0f67">Credit Cards</h2><p><strong>What’s happening now: </strong>The interest rates you pay on any balances that you carry should fall after the Fed has acted, though it may not be instant and it will vary by card issuer.

Rewards cards, for instance, often charge higher-than-average interest rates.</p><p><strong>Where and how to shop: </strong>Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-finds-large-banks-charge-higher-credit-card-interest-rates-than-small-banks-and-credit-unions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent up a flare</a> to let people know that the 25 biggest credit-card issuers had rates that were 8 to 10 percentage points higher than smaller banks or credit unions. For the average cardholder, that can add up to $400 to $500 more in interest each year.</p><p>Consider seeking out a smaller bank or credit union that might offer you a better deal. Many credit unions require you to work or live someplace particular to qualify for membership, but some bigger credit unions may have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/credit-unions-anyone-can-join-170123360.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">looser rules</a>.</p><p>Before you make a move, call your current card issuer and ask them to match the best interest rate you’ve found in the marketplace that you’ve already qualified for. And if you do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/your-money/credit-card-balance-transfer-can-reap-savings-if-done-cautiously.html" title="">transfer your balance</a>, keep a close eye on fees, whether your initial interest rate expires and if so, what it might jump to.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prospective home buyers would be wise to get several mortgage rate quotes from a selection of mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick T.

Housing prices remain high, in large part because there simply aren’t enough homes to meet demand.</p><p>Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages don’t move in tandem with the Fed’s benchmark, but instead generally track with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including expectations about inflation, the Fed’s actions and how investors react.</p><p>The average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/business/mortgage-rates.html" title="">6.2 percent</a> as of Thursday, down from 6.35 percent the previous week and 7.18 percent this time last year.

As a result, you’ll need to give up a fair bit of information before getting an actual price quote.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM5ODRiMjg2LTQ0NjUtNWVlMS05MzlkLWQ5YWZhNmY2OGQyMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/business/fed-interest-rates#fed-rate-cut-business-effects" data-source-id="100000009660850"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-09-17T09:01:12.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Sept. 17, 2024, 5:01 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rob-copeland" itemprop="name">Rob Copeland</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison" itemprop="name">Joe Rennison</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeanna-smialek" itemprop="name">Jeanna Smialek</a></p><p>Rob Copeland covers banking and Wall Street from New York, Joe Rennison writes about markets from New York and Jeanna Smialek reports on the Federal Reserve in Washington.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates this week, by either a quarter or a half a percentage point.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s easy to assume that lower interest rates are a panacea. Almost everyone, after all, is affected to some degree by the cost of borrowing. When the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rates — as it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/business/economy/fed-rates-powell-jackson-hole.html" title="">expected to do this week</a> for the first time since the pandemic — that makes credit less expensive for consumers and corporations alike. The cheaper debt means companies can spend more to expand, just as consumers might be able to afford bigger homes with lower mortgage rates.</p><p>But there is a complicated and somewhat unpredictable interplay between interest rates and the business world. Lower rates bolster the economy, but for companies and their investors, lower rates do not always carry unalloyed positive effects.</p><div><p>Here’s what to expect for corporate America when the Fed lowers rates:</p><h2 id="link-12cbb278">For markets, it’s all about ‘why.’</h2><p>All else equal, lower rates are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/business/interest-rates-falling-downside.html" title="">good for the stock market</a>. When investors gauge the value of a stock, they tend to come up with a higher figure when interest rates fall because of a common valuation principle known as discounting, in which a company’s future cash flows and costs become more attractive under low-rate conditions.</p><p>Fed officials are expected to cut rates by a quarter or a half a percentage point at this week’s meeting. In practice, according to analysts, the reason rates are being lowered matters more than the precise timing or magnitude.</p><p>If the economy is faltering, forcing the Fed to lower rates quickly, that can be a headwind to the stock market. A gentle return to a more normal level of rates — at least in the context of the past few decades — is less likely to crimp corporate profits in the way that an economic downturn could.</p><p>“It’s less about when they cut and how quickly, and more about why they cut,” said Greg Boutle, head of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas.</p><p>Some history: The Fed began lowering rates in September 2007, in the early stages of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/business/economy/26inquiry.html" title="">financial crisis</a>. Over the next 12 months, the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 20 percent. But cuts to rates in 1995 and 1998 came alongside a strong rally for stocks.</p><p>For the time being, the consensus among economists appears to be that the economy will remain resilient, underpinning lofty stock valuations. But there is plenty of uncertainty over global growth, geopolitics and the coming presidential election weighing on investors.</p><h2 id="link-3127219f">Bank on mixed news for lenders.</h2><p>There are few businesses more sensitive to interest rates than banks. That’s because lenders generally make money off the difference between what they pay depositors and what they charge to borrowers, such as home buyers in need of mortgages and trading firms who want leverage to supercharge their bets.</p><p>That difference is known as a spread, and higher rates allow banks to collect a larger spread. No wonder, then, that the biggest bank stocks dropped last week when executives from major institutions such as JPMorgan Chase warned that analysts were being too optimistic about how lenders would fare if rates drop and spreads shrink.</p><p>On the flip side, large investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as well as some corporate law firms have been hankering for the fees they can collect for advising on mergers and acquisitions, when one company buys another. Lower rates make it cheaper for those companies — or the private equity firms that back them — to take out loans to support those purchases and increase the likelihood of deals coming together.</p><p>Remember, though, that while mergers can pay off for investors and corporate executives whose contracts include deal-based payouts, rank-and-file employees could see their jobs disappear as part of “synergies” or cost-cutting efforts needed to pay back the loans that made the deals possible.</p><h2 id="link-7144de1e">Commercial landlords will take all the help they can get.</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>It will take far more than a drop in rates to save the flailing office market.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>While the Fed’s benchmark rate does not directly affect residential or commercial real estate mortgage rates — it can take months for lower interest rates to trickle down — landlords rely heavily on debt and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/business/office-building-foreclosures-losses.html" title="">will welcome any relief</a> in the form of refinancing.</p><p>It will take far more than a drop in rates, however, to save the flailing office market. Many of the most distressed (i.e., empty) commercial buildings are in relatively unpopular downtown areas, and as many employees continue working remotely, it’s unclear if these spaces will ever be financially viable again.</p><p>And if lower rates allow more commercial properties to change hands at lower prices, that could force big landlords to lower the value of comparable properties in their portfolios. Many landlords and investors have been resisting this, arguing that the lack of recent comparable transactions makes the exercise futile.</p><p>An uptick in activity spurred by lower rates could prompt a cascade of falling building valuations.</p><h2 id="link-18ea1f49">Cue a business borrowing binge.</h2><p>If companies can borrow more cheaply, the savings should mean they can spend more on hiring, for acquisitions, or to reward their shareholders with stock buybacks and dividends. That spending is one way lower rates would flow through the global economy.</p><p>But if lower rates are accompanied by rising macroeconomic worries, lenders could be hesitant about extending credit to indebted, struggling companies. In that case, the interest rates on offer might not change all that much.</p><p>For now, those worries remain on the back burner, and the prospect of lower rates has already revitalized appetite for lending from bond investors trying to lock in higher rates — and higher returns — before the Fed begins to cut. That has been welcomed by corporate America, especially by companies whose bonds are due in the near future or borrowers with weaker credit ratings.</p><p>Riskier, “high-yield” bond sales are coming in at a faster clip than they have in the past couple of years, with nearly $200 billion of borrowing in 2024 so far, according to the data provider Refinitiv. Pitchbook, another data provider, also noted a flurry of borrowing in August and September across bond and loan markets.</p><h2 id="link-5d420d76">Everyone tries to predict the economy, but no one can.</h2><p>Let’s be clear: The fact that the Fed is likely to cut interest rates is good news overall, in that it is the clearest sign yet that inflation is coming under control.</p><p>Price increases have been slowing for years. Overall <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/consumer-price-index" title="">Consumer Price Index</a> inflation stood at 2.5 percent in the year through August, down from a peak of 9.1 percent in the summer of 2022.</p><p>As inflation approaches a normal pace, it has allowed the Fed to focus more intently on its other goal: maintaining a strong job market. By lowering interest rates gradually, the Fed is hoping to cool inflation without grinding the job market to a halt.</p><p>So far, consumer spending is holding up and hiring is continuing, albeit at a slower pace than in 2022 and 2023. But the unemployment rate has been creeping up over the past year, a warning that the Fed could overdo its efforts to cool the economy.</p><p>Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, acknowledged <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a recent speech</a> that figuring out the perfect speed to cut interest rates in order to nail the so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/business/economy/fed-interest-rates-labor.html" title="">soft landing</a> could be a challenge.</p><p>A slower pace of cuts would come at “the risk of moving too slowly and putting the labor market at risk,” he said. But, he added, “cutting the policy rate at a faster pace means a greater likelihood of achieving a soft landing but at the risk of overshooting on rate cuts.”</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
