    <h1>Israeli Military Tells Lebanese Not to Return to Some Southern Areas</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Israeli military “does not intend to target you and therefore you are prohibited at this stage from returning to your homes from this line south until further notice,” Mr. Adraee said in <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1861985465680932977" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an online post</a> that included a map showing part of the country’s south marked in red. “Anyone who moves south of this line — puts himself in danger.”</p><p>Some of the most heavily damaged communities in Lebanon are the towns along its border with Israel. For years they were effectively governed by Hezbollah, the militant group backed by Iran.</p><p>Beginning in October 2023, the group used those towns to launch near-daily rocket attacks on northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas, its Iran-backed ally in the Gaza Strip. The attacks forced tens of thousands in Israel to flee their homes. But few Israelis appeared eager to rush back when the truce began.</p><p>Israel intensified its military response to Hezbollah’s attacks in mid-September and began a ground invasion on Oct. 1. The war killed about 3,800 Lebanese and 100 Israelis, according to their governments.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">Under the cease-fire agreement</a>, both Israel and Hezbollah will observe a 60-day truce. During that time, Israel will gradually withdraw its military from Lebanon, and Hezbollah will move its fighters out of southern Lebanon, creating a sort of buffer zone between Israel’s border and the Litani River.</p></div></div>
