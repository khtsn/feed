Autumn Laughlin, 11, chimed in; her E.T.A. was almost exactly the same. Soon they would turn onto a dirt road that led through a forest of tall pines, rolling slowly down a steep hill until the shining surface of North Pond popped into view. The third friend, Ingrid Hagenbuch, 11, was delayed by a stop to buy a bathing suit.</p><p>They had looked forward to this reunion since last August, and every minute mattered. Their weeklong overnight camp in Rome, Maine, <a href="https://pinetreesociety.org/camp-home/pinetreecamp/dirigo-experience/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pine Tree Camp’s Dirigo Experience</a>, is the only one in the state exclusively for children who are Deaf or hard of hearing. For some of the 22 campers from around the state — many of whom are the only Deaf or hard-of-hearing students in their small rural schools — it would be the only time all year they spent with peers who were like them in this way.</p><p>“I’m finally home,” said Jayson Seal, 13, describing how he felt when he arrived. Like several other people interviewed for this article, he spoke through an American Sign Language interpreter. </p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-2"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Chad Unger for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-01-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-01-vwqp-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-01-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-01-vwqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Chad Unger for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-02-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-02-vwqp-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-02-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-02-vwqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit=""><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-03-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-03-vwqp-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-03-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-03-vwqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Pine Tree Camp’s Dirigo Experience is the only camp in Maine exclusively for children who are Deaf or hard of hearing. </span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His father, Joshua Seal, created the Dirigo Experience two years ago, determined to provide his four young children, and others across Maine, with an experience he never had as a Deaf child growing up there: a traditional summer camp adventure alongside Deaf and hard-of-hearing peers. The name comes from Maine’s state motto, Latin for “I lead.”</p><p>Mr. Seal was supposed to be at camp this August, signing an exuberant welcome as campers emerged from their cars and darting around to ensure each one settled in.</p><p>But he did not get to see the third season of the camp he started. Mr. Seal was among the 18 people killed in Lewiston, Maine, on Oct. 25 of last year, when a gunman opened fire at a bar and a bowling alley. Mr. Seal, who was 36, was at the bar that night, playing in a weekly cornhole league with a group of Deaf friends. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/us/maine-shooting-deaf-community.html" title="">Four of them were killed</a>, devastating Maine’s small Deaf community.</p><p>As the head of interpreter services for Pine Tree Society, a nonprofit that supports Maine residents with disabilities, Mr. Seal had become well known in the state during the coronavirus pandemic, interpreting in American Sign Language at news conferences held by Gov. Janet Mills. His dream of creating a camp was made possible by his ties to Pine Tree, which owned the property in Rome and had a <a href="https://pinetreesociety.org/camp-home/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long history of running outdoor programs</a> for Maine children and adults with disabilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Kevin Bohlin, a close friend of Mr. Seal who had partnered with him to start the camp, recalled that even in his shock and grief last fall, he was determined to make sure the camp endured.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-11-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-11-vwqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-11-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-11-vwqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/03/multimedia/03nat-maine-camp-11-vwqp/03nat-maine-camp-11-vwqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Two girls wearing life jackets sit inside a canoe.

The camp, an hour north of Lewiston in the woodsy Belgrade Lakes region, differs little from others nearby for hearing children.

A tense dispute during a game of four square elicited bouts of impassioned signing, as well as very audible howls of outrage. A loud, lively mix of popular music — Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Lana Del Rey — played at the beach during morning swim, as Maya and her friends stood waist deep in the water holding hands, then dunked.</p><p>Later, back in Cabin 2, Maya broke out a few exuberant dance moves and showed off a stack of handmade friendship bracelets. The three girls had polled everyone at camp on their favorite colors, pretending it was for a survey; in secret, they planned to craft a bracelet for every camper and staff member by the time camp disbanded.</p><p>It was the unspoken understanding between them, they explained, that made their week together special. “Here, if I say ‘What?’ because I missed something, my friends will repeat it,” Autumn said. “At home I have a friend who’s sensitive, who sometimes gets mad if I ask her to repeat things, even though she knows I’m hard of hearing.”</p><p>At her school, Ingrid said, she is the only student who wears hearing aids, which connect to a special microphone that her teachers wear around their necks. “At camp, everyone understands what it’s like,” she added.</p><p>It wasn’t always easy to be away from home. Fionn McLoughlin, a seventh grader, said he had shed some tears after lights out, when unwanted thoughts of zombies crowded in.

He recalled one 8-year-old camper who was stunned to realize that the camp was run by Deaf adults.</p><p>“He said to me and Josh, ‘Are you both Deaf?’ and I said yes, and he said, ‘What about them?’ I said, ‘Yeah, them too.’ And he said, ‘I thought Deaf people died younger.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Lounging on the grass during swim time — while intermittently besieged by younger campers begging him to come and swim — Darris Winship, 16, said that “people often think Deaf people are stupid, that they can’t be ‘normal.’ But we are so capable.
