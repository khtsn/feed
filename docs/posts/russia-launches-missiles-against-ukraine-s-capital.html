Ukraine’s military on Wednesday reported a wave of aerial bombing targeting its troops holding a pocket of Russian territory near the northern border that was captured last summer.</p><p>As air raid alerts wailed in Kyiv around 6 a.m. and civilians headed for hallways or basements for safety, the Ukrainian air force said it was tracking 96 aerial targets entering the country’s airspace. That included missiles, ending an unusual 73-day pause in Russia’s use of the weapons to strike civilian and military targets in the capital.</p><p>The air force said four missiles were aimed at Kyiv and two were short-range missiles fired into the northeastern border area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The city has in that period come under numerous drone attacks. Scores of drones were also used in the attack on Wednesday, the air force said.</p><p>Across Ukraine, the past few months have also seen a longer than usual break from large-scale missile attacks. The last major missile attack came on Sept. 3, with a strike on a military academy in the eastern Ukrainian city of Poltava that killed more than 50 people.</p><p>Military analysts had speculated that Russia was stockpiling missiles for use after the onset of freezing weather, which can wreak additional havoc in a city after a strike if heating is knocked out and water pipes freeze. The season’s first snowstorm swept over central Ukraine on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A strike on Sept. 3 on a military academy in the eastern Ukrainian city of Poltava killed more than 50 people.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Also Wednesday, Russia said that a senior Russian naval officer was killed in the city of Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea after a bomb planted under his car exploded.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Russia’s Investigative Committee, which is responsible for investigating serious crimes, said it was considering the death as an act of terrorism. It did not name the officer.</p><p>In Kyiv, explosions rang out early Wednesday and the authorities said air defense systems were firing at incoming missiles and drones.</p><p>In the attack, Russia synchronized the arrival in the capital of fast-flying ballistic missiles and slower-moving cruise missiles, a common tactic. The Kyiv city military administration initially said North Korean-made Hwasong ballistic missiles, which Pyongyang has provided to Russia, may have been used. But Ukraine’s air force later reported that two Russian-made Iskander-M ballistic missiles were shot down.</p><p>In Kyiv on Wednesday, falling debris started fires in the city’s suburbs and wounded one person, local authorities reported. Two short-range S-300 air defense missiles that had been repurposed by Russia for ground attack were also fired over Ukraine’s northeastern border, the air force said. It provided no details on what they targeted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Russia also launched 90 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed one-way attack drones.</p><p>The pause in missile strikes had left residents of the capital on edge, as they anxiously waited for them to resume.

Blinken, who was in Brussels on Wednesday for meetings with NATO and European officials to discuss Ukraine’s war against Russia, addressed the issue of the North Korean troops. They had been “injected into the battle,” he said, “which demands and will get a firm response.”</p><p>The troops assembled by Russia are expected to try to dislodge the Ukrainians from a pocket of Russian turf captured last summer. Ground assaults and aerial bombardments against Ukrainian positions have begun. On Tuesday, Russia dropped 50 guided bombs on the Ukrainian-controlled area, Col.

The extent of the fighting and reported damage could not be independently verified.</p><p>The Russians are close to cutting off the main road supplying Ukraine forces in the area, threatening large groups of soldiers who are defending the town. The approach to Kurakhove is lined with burned-out cars and the town itself has been steadily blasted into oblivion.</p><p>The blowing up of a dam on the northwestern edge of the reservoir, which Ukraine blamed on Russian forces, is now complicating efforts to evacuate the civilians in villages downstream, as floodwaters steadily rose this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But even without rising waters, the drones that saturate the skies increasingly made all movement in and around the town deadly, people in the area said.</p><p>“They strike anywhere,” said Yaroslav Chernyshov, a 20-year-old volunteer with the charity Children New Generation, who was helping to evacuate civilians in the area. “Civilian cars are just as shattered as military ones.”</p><p>He said he recently lost a colleague in a drone attack during a mission to pick up a woman with a 2-month-old baby.</p><p>A colleague in a second car was hit by a drone and died, he said. “We tried to resuscitate him and managed to get him to a stabilization point alive, but sadly, he didn’t make it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A street covered in debris from destroyed residential buildings in Kurakhove.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anton Shtuka/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
