But their salaries — some as high as $40,000 or $50,000 or more — are outmatched by the depth of the city’s affordability crisis and the severity of its housing crunch.</p><p>This is not the homeless problem that New Yorkers are most familiar with: people sleeping on subway cars or begging for change on street corners, often struggling with mental illness or addiction. These are the people who help make New York run, now shut out of the city’s rental market.</p><p>“We are living in a world of musical chairs where there are not enough chairs for everyone,” said John Kimble, a senior adviser at the NYC Fund to End Youth &amp; Family Homelessness. “Someone is going to be left standing.”</p><p>There is perhaps no more visceral symbol of the hollowing out of New York City’s middle class than the emergence of the employment shelter: facilities that cater to people who work in jobs, many of them full-time, that in a different city or a different economy would never make them rich but would not leave them homeless.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The saddest thing I’ve seen is that people are getting priced out of New York City so badly that they are not even moving out of the city,” said Mr. Sancho-Persad, 30. “They are just getting evicted and coming to live in the shelter.”</p><p>Thousands of working people live the way Mr. Sancho-Persad does. They are line cooks, librarians, home health aides, bartenders, truck drivers, janitors and nurses. They drive ambulances and Ubers and work in construction and in concessions at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. They wheel teetering piles of Amazon packages into apartment buildings.</p><p>They work with children and adults with disabilities and often conceal their housing situation from their co-workers and clients.</p><p>Some work for the city or state: as cleaners and fare evasion beaters on the subways and buses, mental health counselors, exterminators in public housing, school teachers and police officers.</p><p>“New York City is becoming more for the wealthy, and I don’t think that’s going to end well,” Mr. Sancho-Persad said. “You know why? Poor people make this city go.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-3717fb66">Years of work unraveled by illness</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/met-homeless-workers--hjfq/met-homeless-workers--hjfq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/met-homeless-workers--hjfq/met-homeless-workers--hjfq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/met-homeless-workers--hjfq/met-homeless-workers--hjfq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Kuber Sancho-Persad leans against an older Toyota with smoke pouring out of the exhaust pipe." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/met-homeless-workers--hjfq/met-homeless-workers--hjfq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/met-homeless-workers--hjfq/met-homeless-workers--hjfq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/met-homeless-workers--hjfq/met-homeless-workers--hjfq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 684w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/met-homeless-workers--hjfq/met-homeless-workers--hjfq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1367w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/98d4795c-e750-5ec9-86f8-2d822e0aac0d" decoding="async" width="600" height="899"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kuber Sancho-Persad’s late father was a longtime yellow taxi driver, and kept his Toyota Cressida as his personal car.

He parked his yellow taxi outside, hoping he wouldn’t get a ticket in the morning. He helped his mother out of the passenger seat and lifted the bags they had hurriedly packed when they realized they were being kicked out of their home. They have lived at the shelter ever since.</p><p>Mr. Sancho-Persad’s parents, immigrants from Trinidad, had done everything they thought they were supposed to do to keep their family out of this kind of trouble. They worked hard, saved money, bought a house and invested in their son’s education. The taxi, which Mr. Sancho-Persad’s father drove for about 30 years, was always at the center of their push to achieve a working-class life.</p><p>Mr. Sancho-Persad joined the family business in his early 20s, after completing three semesters of college. He had been pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering, hoping to fulfill a childhood dream of working on public transportation systems. Then his parents got too sick to work.</p><p>His mother, who was a home health aide, was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. His father was weakened by years of struggling with asthma and diabetes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The family had been climbing the economic ladder for years, saving enough to go on occasional vacations — once driving to Canada to visit relatives in Mr. Sancho-Persad’s father’s taxi, with the light turned off. His father purchased a modest home in the East Bronx, though a relative took out the mortgage for him because of his low credit score.</p><p>But illness unraveled those years of work, and soon Mr. Sancho-Persad was the only member of the family who could consistently bring in money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Blue Sky Residence in Queens, close to LaGuardia Airport, was originally built as an airport hotel.

So the next day, his father rode shotgun, guiding him through traffic and offering wisdom: Never race other taxis to a fare. Always ask passengers what route they’d like to take. If they keep talking after that, it means they want to chat. If they don’t, it’s better to stay quiet.</p><p>His father died in 2017. His mother was still sick, and Mr. Sancho-Persad started working as her caregiver in the morning for $18.75 an hour, paid through Medicaid, while still driving his cab at night. But when the coronavirus pandemic struck and the streets emptied out, he struggled to find enough fares to make ends meet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>At home, things were falling apart.

By the time he turned 55, he assumed he would be there forever.</p><p>Then, a fire broke out in the apartment. The damage was so extensive that he could not stay. Priced out of apartments in his rapidly gentrifying corner of Bedford-Stuyvesant, he ended up at a Bronx employment shelter.</p><p>Mr. Robinson had spent years advancing at the Department of Parks &amp; Recreation, starting as a cleaner, then working at a recreation center and eventually maintaining the vast lawns of Pelham Bay Park.</p><p>He had a decent salary, $24 an hour, and assumed his stay in the shelter would be brief. He hoped to secure a housing voucher from the city, available primarily to people living in shelters, that would make him eligible for privately owned housing. His rent would be partially subsidized by the city for at least five years.</p><p>The reality was far more complicated.</p><p>Mr. Robinson earned too much money in the summer, when he worked his longest hours, to qualify for a voucher. He would have to seek out lower-paid work and now makes $18 an hour, working 30 to 40 hours a week as a fire guard, monitoring safety equipment at city buildings and construction sites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>That job keeps him eligible for a city voucher. But the city’s housing supply and demand is so profoundly out of balance that Mr. Robinson, now 58, has spent about two years trying to find an apartment he can get with his voucher, which has a rent limit. There is no limit to the amount of time he can spend in a shelter, no deadline for him to leave. It takes all his energy not to give into his overwhelming feeling of being stuck.</p><p>“I had ambition,” Mr. Robinson said. “I try to do the best I can. It seemed to me like that backfired. Being lazy would have been more efficient than trying to do better.”</p><p>In many ways, New York City’s rental assistance program is working the way it was designed to. Over 120,000 New Yorkers are using the vouchers to help pay for their housing, and about 22,000 people used the program to move from homeless shelters into apartments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On-site caseworkers at the Blue Sky Residence in Queens work with residents to try to find them permanent housing, but the city’s housing shortage presents a major obstacle.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>But well over 10,000 people with vouchers are still looking for open apartments while the city’s vacancy rate sits at a 50-year low.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>To qualify for a voucher, New Yorkers cannot earn more than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which works out to about a $30,000 salary for a single adult and roughly $60,000 for a family of four.</p><p>That means, like Mr. Robinson, many working homeless people are playing a constant game of mental math to calculate how many hours they can work without losing their housing voucher.</p><p>One Blue Sky resident made $90 too much one month and lost a subsidized apartment she thought she had secured, said Shantel Hayes, the shelter director.</p><p>“Do you have that conversation with your residents to be like, don’t work the overtime, because we want you to qualify?” Ms. Hayes said. “It sucks.”</p><h2 id="link-3a08bb86">A new kind of shelter</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ruth R., a single mother who works as a family advocate for struggling New Yorkers, recently became homeless herself.
