data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The United States has accepted a 747 jetliner as a gift from the government of Qatar, and the Air Force has now been asked to figure out a way to rapidly upgrade it so it can be put into use as a new Air Force One for President Trump, a Defense Department spokesman confirmed Wednesday.</p><p>“The secretary of defense has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar in accordance with all federal rules and regulations,” Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement on Wednesday. “The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the president of the United States.”</p><p>The plane, which industry executives estimated is worth about $200 million, will require extensive work before it can be considered secure enough to carry Mr. Trump, Pentagon officials have acknowledged in recent days.</p><p>“Any civilian aircraft will take significant modifications to do so,” Troy Meink, the Air Force secretary, said on Tuesday during Senate testimony. “We’re off looking at that right now what it’s going to take for that particular aircraft.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The plan has drawn concern from members of Congress, who worry that Mr. Trump will pressure the Air Force to do the work so fast that sufficient security measures are not built into the plane, such as missile defense systems or even systems to protect the plane from the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast.</p><p>“If President Trump insists on converting this plane to a hardened Air Force One before 2029, I worry about the pressures you may be under to cut corners on operational security,” Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, said as Mr. Meink was testifying.</p><p>The gift also has drawn questions from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who worry that Qatar may be trying to improperly influence Mr. Trump, or that the plane itself might have listening devices.</p><p>Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, on Monday publicly said for the first time that his government had approved turning over the plane as a gift, rejecting the idea of it being an attempt to influence the president.</p><p>“We are a country that would like to have strong partnership and strong friendship, and anything that we provide to any country, it’s provided out of respect for this partnership and it’s a two-way relationship,” he said. “It’s mutually beneficial for Qatar and for the United States.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Lipton is a Times investigative reporter, who digs into a broad range of topics from Pentagon spending to toxic
