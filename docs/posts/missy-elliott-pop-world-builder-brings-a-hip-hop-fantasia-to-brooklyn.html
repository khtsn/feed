One of the most influential hip-hop and pop performers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/arts/music/missy-elliott-songwriters-hall-of-fame.html" title="">songwriters</a> and producers of all time, she built a career on hyperreal imagery and music that suggested an intergalactic, quirky, sensual future that even now feels fanciful and far-off.</p><p>And judging by the performance Elliott, 53, delivered at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Monday night, it would have been impossible to ascertain that she’d never toured at this level before. The deftness and imagination on display suggested a performer with a hyperdeveloped sense of image-making, a bone-deep understanding of her catalog, and a desire to make up for lost time and opportunity.</p><p>The tour, titled Out of This World — the Missy Elliott Experience, was a taut, relentless and exhilarating 75 minutes full of theatrical and visual ambition. At times, it had the complexity and density of recent peak pop spectacles, like Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, or the Weeknd’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/arts/music/the-weeknd-super-bowl-halftime-review.html" title="">2021 Super Bowl halftime show</a>. But it was also kin to the films of Baz Luhrmann, Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics — events in which precision, creativity and absurdism comfortably coexist, and actually rely upon each other.</p><p>The show was less a conventional concert than a dynamic carnivalesque D.J. set of strung-together Elliott smashes (her own, mainly, but at one point late in the night, some which she wrote or produced for others, like Aaliyah). It presented as one grand adventure — the front-loaded section of hits like “Sock It 2 Me,” “I’m Really Hot” and “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)” (which was preceded by a quizzical nod to “Singin’ in the Rain”) wasn’t much more distinctive than the mid-show run of sex romps “Get Ur Freak On,” “One Minute Man” and “Hot Boyz.” And neither of those sections was more commanding than the sometimes choppy closing run, peppered with laser-beam bouncers like “Work It” and “Lose Control.” The less effective songs sprinkled throughout worked as accent pieces, but also at times undermined the potency of her biggest hits.</p></div></div><div><p>But Elliott was trying to make a point: Like all the most memorable and durable pop heroes, she has built a worldview much bigger than any one of her songs.</p></div><div></div><div><div><p>What was perhaps most striking, though, was how that world didn’t always require Elliott’s presence. During this show, there were countless things to keep an eye on — platforms popping up from the stage and flying out over the crowd; circular screens hovering over the audience,; a video backdrop filled with colorful, surreally animated clips; fire spouting out of either side of the stage; dancers in ferocious lock step; and a small cast of sidekick characters doing light skit work.</p><p>Elliott was there, too, decked out in phenomenally inventive, flamboyant and dynamic outfits — a graffiti-covered puffer parka, fully rhinestoned track suits, a black exoskeleton-like jacket trailed by, essentially, a billowing cape-cum-cocoon that was inflated and trailed behind her for several feet. That was a nod to the outfit that made her famous — the interstellar trash bag chic she showed off in the video for her 1997 breakout single, “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly).”</p></div></div><div><p>When she smiled, which was often, it was electric. But often all you could see of her was the space between her nose and neck, like a person who doesn’t quite wish to be perceived. She rarely appeared fully fixed on the stage, or even on the idea of performing itself — she performed few full songs front to back, instead relying on the immediacy of the chorus and the familiarity of the opening words to trigger a communal response, and then easing back into the ensemble. She was the star, but maybe more important, she was the creative director. When she stepped offstage for a costume change, the show did not take a breather.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At times, Elliott’s show had the complexity and density of recent peak pop spectacles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Derek Blanks</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Around 20 dancers in ruthlessly choreographed routines did the bulk of the visual work, making for a spectacle that was part Busby Berkeley, part “Star Wars” trilogy, rendered through an artificial intelligence reimagining of “Wild Style.”</p><p>And it was notably loud, too, meaning there was less pressure on Elliott’s rapping and singing. Those were just small parts of a bombastic, meticulously produced soundtrack to a novel visual fantasia. It was also a reminder that Elliott in her prime was less a pure vocal hero than a rhythmic genius, a technophilic visual wizard, an imagineer of futuristic Black pop.</p><p>She made an argument here that she was also building a tent — late in the night she was joined onstage by her longtime collaborator Timbaland and the R&amp;B technician Ciara, the night’s first two openers, and also Lil’ Kim, a fellow female hip-hop hero of the ’90s. There was also Busta Rhymes, the main support act, who in his prime was hip-hop’s premier eccentric and a sometime Elliott collaborator. He seemed extremely at home amid the pandemonium — his visual accompaniment was as antic as Elliott’s — and he brought out LL Cool J for a rowdy and meaningful performance of their verses on the seminal remix of Craig Mack’s “Flava in Ya Ear.”</p><p>In Elliott’s music and her often flabbergasting, decades-ahead visual presentation, she laid out threads that would later be picked up on by Kanye West, M.I.A., Drake, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott and many others. The scale of her impact — she was the first female rapper inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame — belies the actual length of her commercial peak. Elliott’s time in the limelight was curiously short — her most meaningful hits appeared during a five-year stretch, from 1997 to 2002. And since then, Elliott has gone long periods without being much seen or heard from.</p><p>She appeared grateful for the opportunity to bask in the adoration from an audience that had waited decades to hail her. She returned briefly onstage after the house lights came up to soak it in without the barriers of costume and sound.</p><p>It was hard not to engage in a dash of sliding-doors speculation. Had a show like this gone on the road two decades ago, it would have instantly recalibrated what hip-hop extravaganzas could be in a live setting. It would have not only bolstered Elliott’s claim to the innovator throne, but possibly created a pathway for her career to develop even beyond the already substantive level of influence she achieved. Elliott peaked early, and then left the pieces behind for others to pick up and iterate on. Imagine instead Elliott cartoons, films, theme parks, energy drinks. Would we — even more than we currently do — simply live in a world of Elliott’s imagination?</p><p>Out of This World — the Missy Elliott Experience continues Friday at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, Ohio, and runs through Aug. 23.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jon Caramanica is a pop music critic for The Times and the host of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/popcast-pop-music-podcast">“Popcast”</a> podcast.
