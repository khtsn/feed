Mr. Vasquez, 20, a full-time student from Modesto, Calif., was on the lookout for tickets to one of the tour’s five shows at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles for him and his sister.</p><p>“I went to go see Beyoncé on the Renaissance tour, and since I knew this was coming up, I knew I had to be saving,” Mr. Vasquez said.</p><p>On Feb. 11, Mr. Vasquez got on Ticketmaster’s online queue for the BeyHive presale, offered exclusively to those who signed up on Beyoncé’s website. After waiting his turn, Mr. Vasquez was surprised to see tickets listed at a minimum of $600 each and many at more than $1,000.</p><p>“The prices were just outrageous by the time I got in there,” Mr. Vasquez said. “I was like, ‘Oh, no, this is not going to work — I’m not going to do that,’ so I just quit it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In recent years, concertgoers have paid eye-popping prices for tickets to see popular artists like Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/arts/music/oasis-reunion-tour-tickets.html" title="">Oasis</a> on tour. But Gen Z fans — those born between 1997 and 2012 — are paying much more for concert tickets than previous generations did when they were young adults. In 1996, the average ticket price for the top 100 tours was $25.81, or about $52 adjusted for inflation, according to <a href="https://data.pollstar.com/chart/2016/12/2009YearEndBusinessAnalysis_268.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> compiled by Pollstar, a trade publication that covers the live music industry. By 2024, average ticket prices had risen to <a href="https://news.pollstar.com/2024/12/13/2024bizanalysis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$135.92</a>. The live music industry has put today’s young adults in an impossibly expensive position.</p><p>For Gen Z, spending on concerts can be budget busters. In a <a href="https://mergeworld.com/verticals/retail/genz-survey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> of 1,000 Gen Z respondents published last year by Merge, a marketing agency, 86 percent admitted to overspending on live events. Fear of missing out, or FOMO, was cited as a top reason. Another <a href="https://newsroom.breadfinancial.com/aaa-summer-travel-survey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> by AAA, the automobile owners group, and Bread Financial, a financial services company, found that Gen Z and millennials were willing to spend more and travel farther to attend live events than older generations are.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The most money Chricket Cho, 27, spent for a show was to see Taylor Swift at the Rogers Center in Toronto: $600 for the ticket, $3,000 for travel and accommodations, and $470 on merchandise.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Audra Melton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Last year, Chricket Cho, 25, attended seven concerts in the United States and Canada: Ms. Swift in Toronto, Bleachers in New York City and Nashville, Gracie Abrams in New York City, and Sabrina Carpenter, Maggie Rogers and Chappell Roan in Atlanta. She spent $8,400 on tickets, merchandise and travel for the shows.</p><p>“I just feel like live music is something that makes me feel alive,” said Ms. Cho, an information technology auditor who lives in Suwanee, Ga., and earns about $100,000 annually. “It’s a moment in time that is different than just listening to music on Spotify or on my record player.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The most money Ms. Cho spent for a single show was to see Ms. Swift at the Rogers Center in Toronto.

But she said soaring ticket prices had made her reconsider going to concerts if the artists weren’t her “all-time favorites” like Ms. Swift or Bleachers, the rock band fronted by Jack Antonoff.</p><h2 id="link-2e78d11c">Skyrocketing Concert Ticket Prices</h2><p>About 50 years ago, fans of Bruce Springsteen paid <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/07/08/in-1976-concert-tickets-cost-less-than-10-now-they-can-go-for-thousands-what-happened/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as little as $8</a>, or $44 adjusted for inflation, to see him perform on his Born to Run tour.

In 2023, the top 100 tours around the world brought in a record-breaking $9.2 billion, up 65 percent from 2019, according to <a href="https://news.pollstar.com/2023/12/16/the-great-return-becomes-a-golden-age-2023s-top-tours-see-massive-historic-growth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> from Pollstar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>This increased demand, mixed with limited seats, high service fees and loose regulations (and an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-live-nation-ticketmaster-monopolizing-markets-across-live-concert" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ongoing antitrust lawsuit</a>) over how tickets are bought and sold, has resulted in a global surge in concert ticket prices.</p><p>On Ms. Swift’s popular Eras Tour, which grossed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticket-sales.html" title="">record $2 billion</a>, the average ticket price was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/2023-stubhub-top-artists-taylor-swift-beyonce-adele.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1,088</a> in 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Cho and her mother, Thippy Cho, got a photo with Taylor Swift.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Audra Melton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Cho takes Polaroid photos at concerts, and displays them at her home.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Audra Melton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Demand-driven <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/your-money/bruce-springsteen-tickets.html" title="">dynamic pricing systems</a> put into place by ticket sellers have also resulted in higher prices.

For Laufey, he paid $300 for one ticket through an online reseller charging more than face value.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Looking back, I probably would have been OK not spending that much for the ticket, especially for where I was seated,” said Mr. Tayebali, 26. “If I had to go back and shake myself and be like ‘Don’t purchase these tickets,’ I would probably do that.”</p><p>Mr. Tayebali said he had gone into credit card debt from buying concert tickets but would never pay more than $500 for one ticket.</p><p>“Concert-going used to be accessible and a fun way to end the evening,” he said.</p><p>He is saving money to buy a ticket to see Beyoncé but is attending smaller, more affordable shows in the meantime.</p><p>Yazmin Nevarez, a customer service lead at a Home Depot in Chicago who earns $51,000 a year, said going to concerts was “a luxury at this point.” She is focusing on seeing only artists she truly loves.</p><p>In August, Ms. Nevarez, 24, will travel to see Bad Bunny at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan. She bought her ticket for $80 through Ticketera, a platform for events in Puerto Rico, and paid about $300 for airfare. Bad Bunny, she said, works hard to preserve Puerto Rican culture, so she thinks the concert will be special.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Nevarez plans to stay with family for most of her trip. But she rented an Airbnb the night of the concert, costing $200, which she will split with friends and family who are also attending the concert.</p><p>“Especially with me being Puerto Rican and going somewhere that my family is from and a place that we visited every other summer, I feel like that would be something to prioritize,” Ms. Nevarez said about the concert.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Allison Santa, 27, estimates she spent $1,000 on tickets for 10 shows last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lyndon French for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Allison Santa, 27, is a business development associate for a solar energy company and a part-time Pilates instructor in Chicago who makes $80,000 a year.
