</span>, sweeping them 2-0 in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428001/sentinels-vs-g2-esports-champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff-ubf" target="_blank">upper final</a> of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2274/champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Americas Kickoff</a> to continue their stampede throughout the competition.</p>

<p>The series played out on G2&#39;s map pick of Abyss and Sentinels&#39; map pick of Pearl. </p>

<p>G2 started Abyss on a 6-0 run, with their double Initiator team comp doing well to pick apart the double Controller, zero Sentinel that their opponents had. Sentinels head coach <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/757/kaplan">
		kaplan	</a>
</span> had his hand forced in the first half, using both of his timeouts to try and patch the holes in his defense.</p>

<p>Still, big-name Duelist signing <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span> continued his relentless firing on the attack side, with his Dimensional Drift earning space for G2 each time it was up. He finished the map with a game-high five first bloods.</p>


<p><em>A three-piece from professor <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4581/jonahp">
		JonahP	</a>
</span> sets up yet another dominant G2 round.</em></p>

<p>G2 entered halftime with a 10-2 advantage after a dominant attack half, with all of the momentum on their side. Still, the large map is widely considered to be more attack-sided, and the zero Sentinel team comp of Sentinels suggests that defense may have been their weaker side.</p>

<p>After winning the pistol round and ensuing anti-eco, G2 won two straight rounds to reach map point. Still, Sentinels did not go down without a fight. They clawed their way towards seven rounds, but were swarmed on a round that G2 had a mixed buy, eventually falling 13-7.</p>

<p>G2 Sentinel player <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> continued his red-hot start to the year, with his 21-12 scoreline marking his fifth-consecutive map with 20-plus kills this season. </p>

<p>Sentinels began Pearl on a tear. Starting on attack, they controlled the pace, managing the ult orb economy to near perfection. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4004/zekken">
		zekken	</a>
</span> on Yoru had his Dimensional Drift by the second round, while <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/36245/n4rrate">
		N4RRATE	</a>
</span> on Fade had his Nightfall by the third.</p>

<p>While hero plays from the duo persisted, Sentinels could not enter halftime with a lead on the map that typically tilts towards the attack side. </p>


<p><em>A <strong>clean</strong> 4 on 4 retake to close the first half from G2.</em></p>

<p>Once G2 shifted over to attack, jawgemo took over. He ended the map with a game-high 21 kills, which included a pair of 4Ks.</p>

<p>G2 dropped just two rounds in the second half, en route to another 13-7 victory that saw Sentinels fall for the first time this year.</p>

<p>Four G2 players ended the series with at least 30 kills, while nobody on the Sentinels side finished above the mark. </p>

<p>With the win, G2 earns a spot at Masters Bangkok, their third consecutive international event, the longest active streak among any team in North America. Big picture, they&#39;ve secured a top-two finish which means they will receive at least two championship points from their Kickoff placement. They&#39;ll be searching for their first trophy in the organization&#39;s history after finishing second place in both Stages of league play last year.</p>

<p>G2 will have two days of rest while the three-team gauntlet of <span data-ref-id="8">
