    <h1>Harris and Walz Plan Rally in Milwaukee During Democratic Convention</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota are planning to hold a rally next Tuesday in Milwaukee, making an appearance in the key battleground state of Wisconsin as Democrats gather for their national convention in nearby Chicago, according to four people briefed on the discussions who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal the campaign’s plans.</p><p>The Harris campaign is in talks to hold its event at Fiserv Forum, the arena where former President Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination last month, two of the people said, though an agreement on the venue has not yet been formalized.</p><p>The Harris-Walz rally in Milwaukee would be the latest visit on a tour in which the candidates spoke to crowds of over 10,000 people at five stops in battleground states last week. The campaign has jubilantly pointed to the events’ high energy and Mr. Walz has bragged about the turnout, irritating Mr. Trump to the point that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/us/politics/trump-harris-crowds-ai.html" title="">he falsely claimed the Harris crowds were fake</a>.</p><p>The planned rally on Tuesday would most likely take place before the prime-time speeches in Chicago, where former President Barack Obama is set to be the night’s featured attraction. Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee is about 80 miles from the United Center in Chicago, where Democrats will gather for their convention.</p></div></div>
