<p><strong>After EDG&#39;s 3-13 loss on map one, as the IGL, how do you adjust yourself during the rest time? Additionally, on map three, did you predict that Paper Rex would choose a comp like that?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>nobody: &#34;I can only adjust myself. For my teammates, they have to adjust themselves. We also actually didn&#39;t predict it, but I didn&#39;t feel that their comp was going to threaten us.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is Muggle&#39;s first go as head coach for Champions. You&#39;ve already managed to take your team to playoffs; how do you feel about it and what would you say has been the difference maker to achieve these results?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Muggle: &#34;I think I&#39;m really relieved, but I don&#39;t think there was much change since we just did change to other people in front of the camera. The most important reason we can do this is because our resilience is better than before.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You faced against Paper Rex six times. This time, did you have a special strategy against them?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Muggle: &#34;Before the matchup, we just said that if our total rounds aren&#39;t 5-26, it&#39;ll be a success for me.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In CHICHOO&#39;s post-match interview, you said you didn&#39;t want to go against Trace in the playoffs. Was this simply because you didn&#39;t want to face a team from the same region, or was it because of how good they&#39;ve looked in the group stage so far?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHICHOO: &#34;The reason is because we came from the same region. This kind of situation happened last year in Champions 2023. I didn&#39;t want this to happen again, but it happened. We&#39;re just gonna fight it.&#34;</p>
