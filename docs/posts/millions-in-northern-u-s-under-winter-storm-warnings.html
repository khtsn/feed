Wind gusts up to 80 miles per hour are expected Thursday afternoon into the evening, bringing blizzard conditions to areas with lake-effect snow and making travel treacherous.</p><p>Forecasters with the National Weather Service in New York City said that Thursday night into Friday would be the coldest night and early morning of the season, especially after accounting for wind chill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/nyregion/halloween-nyc-weather-hot.html" title="">which experienced</a> one of its warmest Halloweens ever this fall, some welcomed the return of more-seasonable temperatures.
