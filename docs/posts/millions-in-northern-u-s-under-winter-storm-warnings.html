Wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour are expected Thursday, bringing blizzard conditions to areas with lake-effect snow and making travel treacherous.</p><p>Forecasters with the National Weather Service in New York City said that Thursday night into Friday would be the coldest night and early morning of the season, especially after accounting for wind chill.</p><p>In New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/nyregion/halloween-nyc-weather-hot.html" title="">which experienced</a> one of its warmest Halloweens ever this fall, some welcomed the return of more-seasonable temperatures. At an outdoor Christmas tree lot in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, Rosie Roop, 25, a hospitality and business student, was buying a wreath. “I’m happy it’s getting colder,” she said. “I just want it to snow.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Roop said she had worn her puffy coat for the first time this week. “I definitely like the four seasons,” she said. “I have not been a fan of the murky in-between.”</p><p>The chilly weather inspired Danny Offermann, 28, an assistant principal at a charter school in the South Bronx, to visit a Christmas tree lot and buy a two-foot tree ($60) for his apartment.</p><p>“I was a little disappointed about the warm fall,” he said. “I’m usually, like, a sweater-weather, fall kind of guy, and I didn’t get that at all this year.”</p><p>Mr. Offermann said he welcomed the cold weather because he lives in an old apartment with a furnace that constantly produces heat. “It’s finally balanced,” he said. “Classic New York living.”</p><p>Down the street at a Target store, Lisa Spaeth, a former ballet dancer, wore a fox fur hat, a fox fur vest over a green coat, and faux fur leg warmers under her boots. She said the cold didn’t bother her too much, as long as she was dressed for it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I want to enjoy being outside,” she said. “As long as I have my fur, I’m fine.”</p><h3 id="link-1de4180"><span>Snow and wind could be hazardous</span></h3><p>An initial shot of snow fell across commuters Thursday morning as the storm system moved across eastern Canada and the cold air dipped across the Northeast. For those along the coast, it was mixing in with rain, and conditions slightly farther inland were an icy, slushy mess. Forecasters warned that brief snow squalls could be possible during the morning hours.</p><p>The strong winds also could knock down tree branches and cause power outages.</p><p>For areas east of the Great Lakes that were hit hard during the lake-effect snow event this week, another foot of snow could fall Thursday and Friday, especially downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. A blizzard warning was also issued for Erie County in Pennsylvania, where winds could reduce visibility to less than a quarter mile on Thursday into Friday. Blizzard warnings were also issued for portions of the Allegheny Mountains, where a couple more inches of snow is possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Moderate amounts of snow are possible over interior New England on Thursday. After the initial band of snow, light snow showers will be possible later in the day across the Northeast, including New York City.</p><p>Blustery conditions will remain in New York City on Friday. By Sunday, temperatures will moderate, and temperatures in the Northeast may return to above normal early next week.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hilary Howard is a Times reporter covering how the New York City region is adapting to climate change and other environmental challenges.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hilary-howard">More about Hilary Howard</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
