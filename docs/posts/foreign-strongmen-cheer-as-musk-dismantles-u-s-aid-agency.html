But they can attract outsize attention. Grant recipients often cross swords with the world’s authoritarian leaders, who view the activities as a threat to their power.</p><p>Mr. Orban — who met in December with Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk — and other foreign officials have persisted in asking the U.S. government to end such programs over the years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“News of U.S.A.I.D.’s dismantlement will be celebrated by dictators around the world and lamented by democrats around the world,” said Thomas Carothers, a former State Department official who leads the democracy, conflict and government program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.</p><p>Discontinuation of the democracy and human rights funding, he said, would have a significant impact on small organizations, which often find themselves waging David vs. Goliath battles.</p><p>“It means that anti-corruption activists trying to expose government theft are unable to do that,” Mr. Carothers said. “It means that independent news outlets that are struggling to stay free of government control don’t have the resources to do that. It means that lots of people fighting against repressive power will be less able to do that.”</p><p>U.S.A.I.D. has come under fire for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/07/asia/us-afghanistan-spending-waste-intl-cmd/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wasteful spending</a> in the past, particularly during the war in Afghanistan, when hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on botched projects, such as an incomplete road and a minimally used power plant.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-rubio-foreign-aid.html" title="">ordering a halt</a> to the aid so that the government could review programs.</p><p>On Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/usaid-trump-musk.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">taking over</a> as acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D. That was followed on Tuesday night by an official memo posted online that said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/usaid-musk-trump-rubio-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">the entire global work force of the agency would be put on leave</a> by the end of Friday. </p><p>Earlier, officials at a different aid agency, the State Department’s bureau for democracy, human rights and labor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/democracy-human-rights-fired.html" title="">issued stop-work orders</a> to contractors.</p><p>Authoritarian leaders have criticized the bureau’s work, which includes significant democracy promotion programs, and they would welcome any erosion of its authority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>U.S.A.I.D. funding for those same kinds of initiatives has had significant impact abroad.</p><p>In Russia, for example, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/world/europe/russia-puts-pressure-on-elections-monitor-golos.html" title="">election monitoring group Golos</a>, which received the American grants, documented extensive voting irregularities during the 2011 parliamentary elections. Anger about those violations led to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/world/europe/thousands-protest-in-moscow-russia-in-defiance-of-putin.html" title="">biggest protests</a> to date against Mr. Putin’s rule and galvanized a broader opposition movement led by the late <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/world/europe/aleksei-navalny-dead.html" title="">Aleksei A.

The following year, as he pushed Russia deeper into authoritarianism, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/world/europe/as-kremlin-ends-us-aid-critics-see-bid-to-quell-dissent.html" title="">terminated</a> all of the agency’s programs in the country.</p><p>In 2023, after Mr. Putin ordered a Russian invasion of Ukraine and led a broad crackdown at home, the co-founder of Golos, Grigory Melkonyants, was jailed. He is being tried for carrying out the activities of an “undesirable” organization, and has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>In Europe and the Caucasus, a withdrawal of U.S. aid could invite more Russian and Chinese influence, some analysts say. Elsewhere in the world, particularly in nations where Washington and Beijing have been competing, China could fill the void.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Trump’s administration and Musk’s actions have created significant opportunities for China and other authoritarian regimes,” said Li Qiang, the founder of China Labor Watch, which seeks to end the forced labor and trafficking of Chinese workers. The group’s State Department funding has been frozen.</p><p>“The U.S. reduction in foreign aid and focus on economic development is essentially mimicking China’s successful model: prioritizing economic growth while neglecting human rights, environmental protection, and labor rights,” Mr. Li said.</p><p>The Trump administration has portrayed U.S.A.I.D. programs as an example of liberal culture run amok, and of government waste.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>U.S.-funded food aid being delivered in Bentiu, South Sudan, in 2023.

They were initiatives funded directly by the State Department. The Biden administration expanded support for L.G.B.T. rights abroad and diversity initiatives, but the bulk of U.S.A.I.D.’s work is focused elsewhere.</p><p>Iran’s criticism of the agency has been more conspiratorial. It has accused the U.S. government of plotting covert operations aimed at overthrowing the Iranian leadership through funding Persian media outlets and human rights organizations focused on Iran. Iranian state media routinely have labeled these funds and groups as “C.I.A. operatives,” to discredit them.</p><p>Mr. Musk is using some of the same rhetoric, denouncing the agency as a “criminal organization” and amplifying conspiratorial posts.</p><p>Some of Mr. Musk’s comments were indistinguishable from those that Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of the lower house of the Russian Parliament, made on Telegram on Wednesday, when he, too, called U.S.A.I.D. a “criminal organization.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk and Donald Trump last month.

In 2023, U.S.A.I.D. funding represented .07 percent of the U.S. federal budget. In 2021, before the war in Ukraine, it accounted for .04 percent.</p><p>The broadside against the agency in Washington has led some to wonder if European governments or private donors will step in to pay for the threatened initiatives.</p><p>Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the exiled Russian oil tycoon and Putin opponent, said in a <a href="https://t.me/khodorkovski/9584" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message</a> on Telegram on Monday that he and a fellow Russian businessman, Boris Zimin, would step in to fund “Russian-language media, human rights and analytical projects, as well as humanitarian projects operating in Ukraine.”<span>  </span>But he cautioned they wouldn’t be able to help all grant recipients in full.</p><p>Zselyke Csaky, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform, calculated that the United States spends about $2 billion a year on direct democracy promotion programs, including both direct State Department funds and U.S.A.I.D. grants. Europe, she said, spends about $4 billion, and would need to spend about 50 percent more to make up the difference.</p><p>“I find that honestly quite unlikely,” Ms. Csaky said.</p><p>The immediate problem, she said, is the speed of the dismantling. “This is happening right now, and I know many organizations that will need to shut down,” she said.</p><p>“By the time European countries respond,” she said, “there may not be much of the ecosystem to save.”</p><p>Edward Wong<!-- --> contributed reporting from Bangkok, <!-- -->Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> from New York and <!-- -->Linda Qiu<!-- --> from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Paul Sonne is an international correspondent, focusing on Russia and the varied impacts of President Vladimir V.
