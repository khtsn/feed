Harry, who did not appear in court on Wednesday, was scheduled to take the stand next month.</p><p>It marked the end of an era of high-profile legal cases that grew out of the hacking scandal, one of the darkest periods in the history of the British news media. And it gave Harry long-sought acknowledgment for the relentless intrusion of the tabloids into the life of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a car accident in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by photographers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>News Group Newspapers offered a <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/b16bc1c4fb38d1bb/4dde4615-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“full and unequivocal apology”</a> for hacking Harry’s cellphone and intruding into his personal life and that of Diana, “in particular during his younger years.”</p><p>“We acknowledge and apologize for the distress caused to the duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships and family, and have agreed to pay him substantial damages,” the company said in a contrite, five-paragraph statement, referring to Harry by his formal title, the Duke of Sussex.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
