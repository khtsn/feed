1,000 days of unrelenting Russian assaults, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his New Year’s address on Wednesday that he believed the United States would continue to stand with Kyiv in “compelling Russia into a just peace.”</p><p>He also reiterated his vow that his country would never give up on the goal of making Ukraine whole again.</p><p>“One day, Ukraine will return to be together,” Mr. Zelensky said, addressing Ukrainians living under Russian occupation in Crimea, the eastern Donbas region and the southern cities of Melitopol and Mariupol.</p><p>Despite his expression of confidence, Mr. Zelensky faces an uphill fight, not just on the battlefield, but also diplomatically.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Even Mr. Zelensky has acknowledged that it might not be possible to oust Russia solely by military means from all of the roughly 20 percent of Ukraine that it currently occupies. But he reiterated that diplomatic pressure from the West could ultimately help repel the Russian offensive led by President Vladimir V. Putin.</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump’s intentions for Ukraine are unclear. He has said that bringing the war to a quick end will be a priority of his administration but has not offered details on how that can be achieved. He has long made his admiration for Mr. Putin known, and has previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/us/politics/trump-putin-ukraine.html" title="">expressed disdain for Ukraine</a>.</p><p>Still, Mr. Zelensky said he had “no doubt that the new American president is willing and capable of achieving peace and ending Putin’s aggression.”</p><p>Russia has also repeatedly stressed its conditions for any negotiations. This week, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated Russia’s demand that Ukraine renounce its right to sovereignty and territorial integrity as a precondition to start peace talks. He told the Russian news agency TASS that it would not enter into any negotiations unless Ukraine renounced its objective of re-establishing its internationally recognized 1991 borders, an area that includes Crimea and the Donbas region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that he believed the United States would continue to stand with Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Geron/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Zelensky said in his address that peace could come only when Ukraine was militarily strong enough to force Mr. Putin into negotiations. Currently, Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/world/europe/ukraine-russia-attacks-eastern-front.html" title="">maintains the initiative across the front</a>, grinding out costly but consistent gains as Ukraine struggles to stabilize its defenses.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Wednesday, Russia’s forces continued to close a pocket of resistance around the Ukrainian town of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/europe/russia-advances-eastern-ukraine.html" title="">Kurakhove in the southern Donbas region</a>, advancing to an industrial plant on the far western edge of the town, according to analysts who track movements on the battlefield using combat footage.</p><p>Russian soldiers released videos showing themselves holding flags at the facility and claiming control of the town, but Ukrainian officials said that pitched battles were still being fought at the plant and that the struggle for control was still playing out.</p><p>In his address, Mr. Zelensky acknowledged the many challenges Ukraine is facing but said that national unity remained its most potent asset.</p><p>“We overcame everything 2024 brought together,” he said. “Victories and setbacks. Joys and challenges. Tears of happiness when we succeeded. And tears of pain when our hearts were wounded.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Although about a third of the weapons Ukraine used on the battlefield in 2024 were produced domestically, its hope of victory depends on the resolve of its allies, he said.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky’s 20-minute address came against the backdrop of wailing air-raid alarms as the new year began much in the same way the old year ended — with Russian drones and missiles streaking across the sky over cities across Ukraine.</p><p>In Kyiv, the capital, wreckage from one drone fell on a residential building only a few minutes from the Presidential Office, partly destroying the residential building’s top two floors and causing a fire, according to Ukrainian emergency services. Two people were killed and seven others were wounded across the city, local officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The site of a drone attack on a residential building in Kyiv on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yan Dodronosov/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Russian missiles and drones targeted Kyiv almost 200 times in 2024, and air-raid alarms sounded more than 500 times, according to city officials.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In those attacks, Russia launched over 1,300 strike drones, 200 cruise missiles, 24 ballistic missiles, 22 Kinzhal aeroballistic missiles and seven hypersonic Zircon missiles, Ukrainian military officials said. Many of those attacks were directed at energy infrastructure, but Russia also damaged almost 550 residential buildings in the capital, leaving almost 120 people homeless, city officials said.</p><p>Those numbers represent only a fraction of the attacks across the country, and the Ukrainian Air Force said that Russia had launched “significantly more” missiles and drones in 2024 than in the previous year.</p><p>Kyiv is far better protected than many other Ukrainian cities that are routinely hit, and the air force warned that the Kremlin had the capability to expand its campaign to shatter Ukraine’s energy grid and punish the Ukrainian public.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said that those same missiles would threaten other nations if Russia were not stopped in Ukraine. And he warned against misguided hope.</p><p>“If Russia shakes your hand today, it does not mean that tomorrow it will not start killing you with the same hand,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
