Last year, a Romanian court ordered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/europe/romania-election-court.html" title="">last-minute cancellation</a> of a presidential election that an ultranationalist appeared well positioned to win.</p><p>In the final days of the campaign, as opinion polls showed the race tightening, Mr. Simion laid the groundwork for a Romanian version of Mr. Trump’s “stop the steal” efforts in 2020. He insisted that only electoral fraud could prevent him from winning.</p><p>On Sunday, shortly before voting ended, Mr. Simion claimed that “many deceased people” had appeared on electoral lists, echoing the claims of Mr. Trump after he lost the 2020 election in the United States. Mr. Simion provided no evidence to support accusations that his victorious rival had benefited from fraud.</p><p>A mathematics prodigy in his youth who earned a Ph.D. in France before becoming a professor in Bucharest, Mr. Dan campaigned as a moderate conservative committed to both the European Union, which Romania joined in 2007, and to NATO, which it has been a member of since 2004.</p><p>Though supported, at least tacitly, by much of Romania’s political establishment, Mr. Dan ran as an independent and presented himself as an outsider untainted by close association with Romania’s two main political parties. Those parties have cycled in and out of power since the 1989 overthrow of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Dan began his public career campaigning against corruption and the destruction of old buildings by real estate developers tied to corrupt politicians. Both candidates were involved in rallies in the early 2000s to save Bucharest’s historic center.</p><p>But while Mr. Simion embraced nationalist politics, campaigning to “unite” Romania with the former Soviet republic of Moldova, which is largely Romanian-speaking, and bits of Ukraine inhabited by ethnic Romanians, Mr. Dan pursued a more moderate agenda. </p><p>Mr. Dan helped found the Save Romania Union, a liberal party, but split with it over the issue of same-sex marriage, which progressives in the party supported. When Romania, at the urging of right-wing activists, held a referendum in 2018 on changing the Constitution to prohibit same-sex unions, Mr. Dan urged his party to stay out of the issue. The referendum failed because of low turnout.</p><p>Leftists view him as a conservative and nationalists as a sellout to the European Union, but his victory on Sunday indicated that voters wanted a middle path between bitterly polarized political camps.</p><p>Campaigning this past week, he said voters had a choice “between a democratic, stable and respected Romania in Europe — and a dangerous path of isolation, populism and defiance of the rule of law.”</p><p>Andrada Lautaru<!-- --> contributed reporting from Bucharest.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
