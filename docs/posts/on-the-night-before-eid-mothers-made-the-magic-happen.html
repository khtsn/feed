She made dishes like beef biryani and goat korma, as well as her signature dish, chicken jhal fry, a masala fried chicken doused with a sweet and spicy sauce.

She has cooked the dish every Eid since.</p><p>Ms. Kabir, 29, a food content creator who gained an interest in cooking after observing her mother in the kitchen, helps how she can, especially as she has gotten older. Her offering the past few years has been a dessert that she calls a ras malai cake. It’s a diasporic creation: an almond crusted sponge cake, similar to tres leches, with masala-infused milk topped with light whipped cream.</p><p>“I want her to feel like she’s being appreciated,” Ms. Kabir said. “She’s been doing this my entire life.

The day is so big and the day is so holy, so they believe that everything need to be clean for the celebration.”</p><p>“I try to make sure that they take the holiday seriously,” added Ms. Diallo about her daughters. “Being here is not easy. A lot of people get westernized, and they forget about their culture.”</p><p>Her efforts have been fruitful. Safiatou Diallo, 28, her eldest, said her favorite part about Eid is choosing the fabric and style for her traditional Fulani outfit and getting it handmade by a tailor. “I even sometimes fantasize about moving back to Africa and just wearing African clothes every day,” she said.</p><p>Yelda Ali has been thinking a lot about how to immerse her 15-month-old daughter, Iman, in her culture. Ms. Ali, 39, the daughter of Afghan refugees, grew up celebrating the holiday house-hopping in Edmonton, Alberta. But for the majority of her 16 years in New York, she didn’t have houses to hop to.

This year, the recipe was an Afghan pasta cooked with ground beef and topped with yogurt and dried mint.</p><p>Mr. Mejia, who is Dominican, has developed a fondness for learning how to cook Afghan dishes.
