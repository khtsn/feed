They will be subject to a 60-day public comment period and, if finalized, would represent “the most significant expansion of contraception benefits” in more than a decade, said Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council.</p><p>The proposal comes just two weeks before the election as Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, make the case that the threat to reproductive rights extends beyond the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, that eliminated the national right to abortion.</p><p>“At a time when contraception access is under attack, Vice President Harris and I are resolute in our commitment to expanding access to quality, affordable contraception,” President Biden said in a statement. “We believe that women in every state must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The court ruled in that case that the “right to privacy” did not confer a right to abortion. In his concurring opinion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/us/clarence-thomas-roe-griswold-lawrence-obergefell.html" title="">Justice Clarence Thomas said</a> the same rationale should be used to overturn other “demonstrably erroneous decisions” that relied on a right to privacy, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/28/nyregion/griswold-v-connecticut-landmark-case-remembered.html" title="">Griswold v. Connecticut</a>, a 1965 case declaring that married couples had a right to contraception.</p><p>“Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out loud, that contraception could very much be at risk and it is at risk,” Ms. Harris told the late-night host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3-KA8ja6g" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jimmy Kimmel in June.</a></p><p>The Affordable Care Act requires that most private health plans cover contraception without “cost sharing,” or co-payments, but the provision applies only to prescription birth control pills; nonprescription birth control pills were not available when President Barack Obama signed the measure into law in 2010. Last year the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/health/otc-birth-control-pill.html" title="">Food and Drug Administration for the first time approved</a> an over-the-counter birth control pill, called Opill.</p><p>In anticipation of that announcement, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, to consider how to expand access to over-the-counter birth control. Monday’s proposed rule flows from that directive.</p><p>Some states, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/us/politics/birth-control-roe-v-wade.html" title="">including Missouri</a>, have tried to restrict access to contraception by banning public funding for certain methods, including intrauterine devices and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/emergency-contraception" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emergency contraception</a> — the so-called morning-after pill, also known as Plan B — which opponents say induce abortion. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/health/morning-after-pills-abortion-fda.html" title="">F.D.A. says</a> that is incorrect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Polls have found <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-birth-control-poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">widespread bipartisan support</a> for access to contraception. In the aftermath of Dobbs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/17/us/politics/birth-control-dobbs-clarence-thomas.html" title="">Democrats began pushing</a> legislation to enshrine a right to contraception in state or federal law. Republicans have consistently voted against such measures.</p><p>“Republicans’ own actions make them the most effective messengers against themselves,” said Chris Fleming, a Democratic strategist who works with the advocacy group Americans for Contraception, which has been running ads against Republicans like Senators Rick Scott of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri.</p><p>The group has also been parading a giant inflatable intrauterine device around the country; the balloon arrived in Washington in the spring after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/us/politics/contraception-bill-senate-democrats.html" title="">Senate Republicans blocked</a> the Right to Contraception Act. Every Republican except Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against the bill.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sheryl Gay Stolberg covers health policy for The Times from Washington.
