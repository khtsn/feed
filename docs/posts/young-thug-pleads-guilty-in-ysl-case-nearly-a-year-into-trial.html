Prosecutors had described him in opening statements 11 months ago as “King Slime,” the fearsome leader of a pack that terrorized the streets of Atlanta via gang warfare, robbery and drug dealing for nearly a decade as his music career took off.</p><p>His guilty plea on Thursday followed a tense courtroom moment in which the judge asked Mr. Williams if he was ready to accept a non-negotiated plea, instead of a negotiated deal with prosecutors, because of an impasse over sentencing. Mr. Williams, looking stricken, conferred with his lawyers briefly before the judge called a recess to allow him to decide.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a non-negotiated plea, the judge is responsible for deciding the sentence based on recommendations from both sides.</p><p>Upon returning, Mr. Williams said he would accept the blind plea; he also pleaded no contest to two additional counts, leading a criminal street gang and conspiracy to violate the RICO act, the state’s racketeering law.</p><p>The state recommended a sentence of 45 years, with 25 served in custody followed by 20 years on probation. Lawyers for Mr. Williams asked the judge for a total sentence of 45 years, serving five that would be commuted to time served, plus house arrest, extensive probation and a variety of charitable requirements.</p><p>Judge Whitaker decided on a total sentence of 40 years, with the first five in prison, commuted to the nearly two years Mr. Williams had already spent in jail. If he is not successful in completing 15 years of probation, the judge said, he could be made to serve 20 additional years in custody.</p><p>She also ruled that Mr. Williams would be required to stay away from metro Atlanta for the first 10 years of his probation, barring certain exceptions; take random drug tests; make anti-gang presentations to groups of children four times annually and perform 100 hours of community service per year while on probation; and refrain from promoting gangs or being around known gang members, excluding his brother, Quintavis Grier (the rapper Unfoonk), and Sergio Kitchens, known as Gunna, who is signed to Mr. Williams’s label.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a statement to the judge before she decided her sentence, Mr. Williams apologized to those involved and asked for leniency.</p><p>“I hope that you allow me to go home today and trust in me to do the right thing and never see you again,” he said. “I promise you, I won’t ever be in this type of situation again. I’m going away, I’ve learned from my mistakes — you know, I come from nothing and I’ve made something. I didn’t take full advantage of it. I’m sorry.”</p><p>The judge said her sentence was influenced by the fact that prosecutors had previously presented a much more lenient deal of 15 years probation if Mr. Williams agreed to special conditions and would “take ownership and responsibility for being the leader of YSL.” He denied the offer.</p><p>Brian Steel, a lawyer for Mr. Williams, said in court that Mr. Williams had accepted a guilty plea because the lengthy trial was “holding this man hostage.” Still, he added, they vehemently disagreed with the prosecution’s version of events.</p><p>“His whole being is trying to break the chains of poverty for others and it has been spun in this courtroom with false statements and allegations against Mr. Williams at every turn,” Mr. Steel said, accusing the authorities of having “tunnel vision” against a famous rapper.</p><p>Mr. Williams’s plea came as his two remaining co-defendants indicated that they planned to continue at trial. Deamonte Kendrick, known as the rapper Yak Gotti, and Shannon Stillwell, known as SB or Shannon Jackson, stand charged with a 2015 murder, in addition to other counts, that prosecutors said kicked off a violent yearslong back-and-forth between two local factions of the national Bloods.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Three other defendants in the trial <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/arts/music/young-thug-trial-plea-deal.html" title="">pleaded guilty this week</a>, clearing the way for the case’s potential end following days of behind-the-scenes negotiations spurred by an evidence mishap by prosecutors during witness testimony.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/09/us/young-thug-arrested-gang.html" title="">The original indictment</a>, filed in May 2022, charged 28 men for their roles furthering the aims of YSL, Young Thug’s successful record label that authorities said overlapped with a gang, Young Slime Life. Opening arguments in the trial, however, began last November with six defendants after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/arts/music/gunna-plea-ysl-case.html" title="">some plea deals</a> and the severing of other defendants from the case.</p><p>The resolution of Young Thug’s involvement in the long-running blockbuster trial, which was streamed online daily for a passionate audience of fans and observers, fell short of a full victory for the Fulton County district attorney, Fani T. Willis. Her office brought the case under the same Georgia criminal racketeering law that she used <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/15/us/trump-indictment-georgia" title="">to indict former President Donald J. Trump</a> and others in what prosecutors call a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>Mr. Williams had faced up to 120 years in prison if convicted on all charges. Another defendant in the case, Marquavius Huey, who had a murder charge against him dropped on Wednesday in exchange for pleading guilty to a single RICO count, had faced three life sentences. He agreed to serve nine years in prison minus time already served, along with nine years of probation, an outcome that the judge called “frankly, remarkable.”</p><p>The trial against Mr. Williams and his associates in YSL <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/20/us/trump-young-thug-rico.html" title="">offered glimpses of what proceedings</a> against Mr. Trump could look like, and also their potential pitfalls, with a complex web of defense motions, challenges around high-profile defendants, news media coverage and the fracturing into separate trials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Young Thug onstage in March 2022.

(YFN Lucci, born Rayshawn Bennett, was charged in a 2021 RICO indictment against his YFN crew in Fulton County; in January, he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/yfn-lucci-guilty-plea-9d24f0c921a4bfa686c073a72e3ffc96" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pleaded guilty to a gang charge</a> and had the rest of the counts against him, including murder, dropped.)</p><p>Although Mr. Kendrick and Mr. Stillwell — the defendants who are still on trial — were charged with the murder of Mr. Thomas, prosecutors attempted to prove that Mr. Williams had authorized the shooting, renting the car used and then providing safe harbor in Miami for those responsible.</p><p>Authorities said the two sides had traded retaliatory shootings across Atlanta in the years that followed, including after the 2022 stabbing of Mr. Bennett in prison.</p><p>Yet the trial was plagued by complications from the start, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/arts/music/shannon-stillwell-stabbed-ysl-young-thug-trial.html" title="">the jail stabbing of Mr. Stillwell</a> and 10 months of jury selection for a case that was estimated to last between six and nine months.</p><p>Once the jury was assembled, the case seemed to falter because of disorganization and a stream of reluctant and obfuscating witnesses, including former defendants who had agreed to testify against YSL when they pleaded guilty before arguments began.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>A battle over the testimony of one self-professed former YSL member who was not indicted as part of the case went so far off the rails that the judge who had overseen most of the trial, Ural Glanville, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/arts/music/young-thug-trial-judge-removed.html" title="">forced to recuse himself</a> after he attempted to send Mr. Williams’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/arts/music/young-thug-brian-steel-trial.html" title="">lead lawyer, Mr. Steel, to jail for contempt</a>.</p><p>Judge Glanville was replaced by Judge Whitaker, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/arts/music/young-thug-ysl-trial-resume.html" title="">sought to streamline the prosecution’s remaining evidence and testimony</a>, and made no secret of her desire to end the trial expeditiously, whether by plea deals or a jury verdict.</p><p>“Good luck to you,” Judge Whitaker told Mr. Williams in closing. “There better be no violations, but if there are any, you’re coming back to see me.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
