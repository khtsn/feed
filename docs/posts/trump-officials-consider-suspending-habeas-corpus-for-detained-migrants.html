And it would be yet another sweeping assertion of executive authority, one in tension with a right generally guaranteed in the Constitution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As with many of Mr. Trump’s assertions of power, it was unclear whether he could lawfully do it.</p><p>Article I of the Constitution says writs of habeas corpus are a privilege that “shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.” That direction “is almost universally understood to authorize only Congress to suspend habeas corpus,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University.</p><p>“The only reason why they would do this is because they’re losing” in court, he added.</p><p>Habeas corpus has been suspended four times in the history of the United States, most recently in Hawaii after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.</p><p>Each time, authorities cited specific congressional statutes to justify the move, with the exception of one president: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/16/archives/presidents-proclamation-the-habeas-corpus-suspended-throughout-the.html" title="">Abraham Lincoln, who suspended habeas corpus</a> during the Civil War, while Congress was not in session. His move was challenged, and in 1863, Congress passed a law giving him the explicit right to suspend habeas corpus for the duration of the hostilities.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his deputies have repeatedly tried to liken their crackdown on illegal immigration to a war or repelling an invasion. He has referred in speeches to waves of migrants entering the United States as invasions, and in March invoked the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/trump-alien-enemies-act-history.html" title="">Alien Enemies Act</a> — another wartime authority — to accelerate the deportations of Venezuelans accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua.</p><p>But deportations carried out under that law <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/boasberg-trump-venezuelan-migrants.html" title="">have been challenged in court</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/trump-deportations-venezuelans-el-salvador.html" title="">Supreme Court has blocked</a> any further deportations under that law for now. In addition, three federal judges have in recent weeks issued rulings rejecting the argument that the wave of immigration constitutes an invasion, as Mr. Miller maintained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, the administration has insisted that the courts cannot overrule the president’s decisions regarding how, where and when immigrants are deported.</p><p>Mr. Miller echoed that sentiment in his comments to reporters outside the White House on Friday, arguing that because Congress put the immigration courts under the executive branch, and not the judicial branch, Mr. Trump’s decisions could not be blocked by the courts.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karoun Demirjian is a breaking news reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia: </strong>Gang experts say the tattoos on Abrego Garcia’s knuckles are unlikely to signify gang membership. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/kilmar-abrego-garcia-tattoos-ms-13.html">The president says otherwise</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deported Before Trial</strong>: As President Trump pushes forward on his pledge to carry out mass deportations, U.S. immigration agents are detaining and deporting some criminal defendants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/criminal-defendants-immigration-deportation.html">before their cases can move through the courts</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skipping Medical Care:</strong> Doctors, nurses and social workers are concerned that people with serious medical conditions are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/health/migrants-health-care-trump.html">forgoing medical care out of fear of being apprehended</a> by immigration officials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rumeysa Ozturk:</strong> The Tufts University doctoral student who was arrested by masked federal agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-detention-vermont.html">must be returned to Vermont</a> from a detention facility in Louisiana, a federal appellate court said.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Conditional Welcome:</strong> The Trump administration says foreign soccer fans considering attending next year’s FIFA World Cup are welcome to visit for a good time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/trump-world-cup-visitors.html">but not a long time</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons For Trump:</strong> The United States is said to be in talks with Rwanda about taking in expelled migrants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/europe/trump-migrants-rwanda-us-uk.html">There may be lessons in Britain’s experience</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
