<p><strong>What did you guys do to prepare for this match today?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically the same thing we always do: watch their VOD, come in with a game plan on how we want to play on both sides of both maps…[Deathmatch], make sure we&#39;re warm, just standard things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How nervous (or not) were you guys coming into today&#39;s matchup?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don&#39;t think we were too nervous or pressured, we know they&#39;re [FNATIC] a good team but we know we&#39;re also a very good team. We kinda just had to go out and play our game, but we kinda fell short.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What do you think went wrong on your pick of Lotus?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think not winning a pistol round didn&#39;t help, they kinda started off hot on both sides. It was still 13-10 but a couple mistakes in key rounds of discipline and just not playing the round correctly kinda cost it along with the pistol rounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How did you feel on Tejo in general today?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel good. Like I&#39;ve been saying with all the questions, the only changes was the missiles. I just have to make sure they get a lot of value; I only have two of them now. They&#39;re kind of like Skye flashes in a sense. The drone and the stun are still really good, so that&#39;s why we&#39;re still playing him; we still think he can be viable on some maps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You were the only one on your team who finished the game with a positive rating. How did you feel not just about your individual performance not just today, but throughout this entire tournament?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#39;m proud of my individual performance stats-wise, but definitely think I can help more with the micro and the macro… Making sure everyone&#39;s on the same page and trying to get team fights together. Ultimately more team play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Looking at Split, a lot of the rounds were opened up by the vent plays. A lot of the times it ended up with you guys in a postplant. Sometimes it went your way and sometimes it didn&#39;t. In the event that it didn&#39;t it was usually off an individual play from the opponent. Do you think there is anything you can do about players having a great game or making a play that messes up an entire site execute or postplant for you guys?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually that play comes from mistakes on our end or he swung into two of us and killed us both which usually wasn&#39;t the case. As long as we can fix up those mistakes, try not to get picked off, have a little better coordination, more teamwork, I feel like the game could have gone either way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>On your attack on Split there were some rounds where it looked like FNATIC had a read or at the very least knew where you guys were going to end. Do you think those rounds impacted the end result today?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yeah, I&#39;ll have to watch the game back but maybe we messed up the execution of it or maybe they had a good read, but I&#39;m not too sure. I wasn&#39;t really in the openers of those so I&#39;ll have to watch it back. From what it felt like, they had a good read on what our gameplay was, so after they got those two or three rounds maybe we knew what their game plan was so we shifted the map according to it [in an attempt to] anti-macro them and it felt way better. Ultimately, they did get those three rounds from that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You guys are the highest-placing Americas team. Do you guys think there&#39;s any additional pressure on you guys heading into these international events with a lot of these high expectations you guys might be held to by the fans?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don&#39;t think so. Like Josh said, we just go back to Americas and dominate again because we know how everyone likes to play. We just gotta get more comfortable to other styles of play in other regions. The experience helps, but there&#39;s no excuses. We should be winning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Your placement in Toronto has all but guaranteed an appearance at Champs. Does this loss maybe hurt a little less or a little more knowing that you will come back to Champions and make another international appearance this year?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It definitely feels good that we made Champs already, but emotions are still high, it definitely sucks to lose. Being a favorite or even just how confident we are in ourselves, going out in the top four [is] still decent, but not what we wanted. It still hurts, but hopefully we can regroup and work harder for Champs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How are you guys going to reset and recover from this loss?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We&#39;re just gonna work harder and use it as fuel to be a better team and be better teammates. Communicate harder, better teamwork, really. Just really hone in on ourselves and figure out our own stuff.</p>
