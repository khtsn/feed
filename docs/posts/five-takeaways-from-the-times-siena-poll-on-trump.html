But they expressed skepticism of some of his specific actions, like deporting legal immigrants who have protested Israel or threatening to send American citizens to prison in El Salvador.</p><p>The poll also asked about specific policies that Mr. Trump has pursued, including ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs and withholding federal money from some universities. Half or more voters opposed both moves.</p><h2 id="link-6a6ab687">Trump is losing his advantage on the economy.</h2><p>For years, one of Mr. Trump’s political assets — perhaps a relic from his years hosting “The Apprentice” — has been the widespread view that he is a businessman who knows what he is doing when it comes to the economy.</p><p>Not in this poll. Mr. Trump’s approval rating on the economy was only 43 percent. Just as worrisome for him: Voters don’t seem to think he understands their problems.</p><p>The economy was one of the biggest factors in Mr. Trump’s victory last year. He promised over and over to tackle inflation on Day 1. But voters aren’t feeling any relief yet.

Skeptical views of him were consistent among men and women, the young and the old, across all races and levels of education.</p><p>The Times/Siena poll even ran a small experiment to test Mr. Musk’s unpopularity. It asked respondents twice about their views of the cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, using Mr. Musk’s name once and leaving it out the other time.</p><p>The cuts were more popular when voters didn’t hear the word “Musk.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shane Goldmacher is a Times national political correspondent.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Use of Power:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-poll-approval.html">Voters believe President Trump is overreaching</a> with his aggressive efforts to expand executive power, and they have deep doubts about some of the signature pieces of his agenda, a New York Times/Siena College poll found. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-times-siena-poll-highlights.html">Here are five takeaways</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ban on Transgender Troops: </strong>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/trump-supreme-transgender-troops.html">asked the Supreme Court</a> to let it start enforcing a ban on transgender troops serving in the military that has been blocked by lower courts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Women’s Health Initiative:</strong> After an outcry from scientists and experts, federal officials said they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/health/womens-health-initiative-cuts.html">restore funding to the initiative</a>, one of the largest and longest studies of women’s health ever carried out.</p></li><li><p><strong>ActBlue: </strong>The president ordered an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/trump-actblue-democrats.html">inquiry into the main Democratic fund-raising platform</a>, in his latest move using the government to target political opponents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overhaul of Election Law: </strong>A federal judge blocked part of an expansive executive order seeking to overhaul election laws, writing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/trump-election-order-judge-blocked.html">President </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/trump-election-order-judge-blocked.html">Trump did not have the authority</a> to require documentary proof of citizenship for all voters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Defunding Sanctuary Cities:</strong> A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/judge-injuction-sanctuary-city-executive-order.html">temporarily blocked the government from enforcing</a> part of one of Trump’s executive orders that directs agencies to withhold funds from cities and counties that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.</p></li><li><p><strong>No More Food Dye?:</strong> The Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would work to remove some artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply, citing concerns about children’s health. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/well/food-dyes-ban.html">Here’s what the data shows</a>.
