But they expressed skepticism of some of his specific actions, like deporting legal immigrants who have protested Israel or threatening to send American citizens to prison in El Salvador.</p><p>The poll also asked about specific policies that Mr. Trump has pursued, including ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs and withholding federal money from some universities. Half or more voters opposed both moves.</p><h2 id="link-6a6ab687">Trump is losing his advantage on the economy.</h2><p>For years, one of Mr. Trump’s political assets — perhaps a relic from his years hosting “The Apprentice” — has been the widespread view that he is a businessman who knows what he is doing when it comes to the economy.</p><p>Not in this poll. Mr. Trump’s approval rating on the economy was only 43 percent. Just as worrisome for him: Voters don’t seem to think he understands their problems.</p><p>The economy was one of the biggest factors in Mr. Trump’s victory last year. He promised over and over to tackle inflation on Day 1. But voters aren’t feeling any relief yet. Quite the opposite: More than twice as many said the economy was doing worse since he took office than better.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-7bfce631">Voters don’t like Elon Musk.</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s approval rating is low, but Elon Musk’s is lower.</p><p>Mr. Musk, the world’s richest man and a top presidential adviser, was viewed favorably by only 35 percent of voters. Skeptical views of him were consistent among men and women, the young and the old, across all races and levels of education.</p><p>The Times/Siena poll even ran a small experiment to test Mr. Musk’s unpopularity. It asked respondents twice about their views of the cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, using Mr. Musk’s name once and leaving it out the other time.</p><p>The cuts were more popular when voters didn’t hear the word “Musk.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shane Goldmacher is a Times national political correspondent.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Deported to a ‘Home’ He Barely Knew: </strong>Two decades had passed since Nascimento Blair was last in Jamaica, his homeland. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/nyregion/deportation-trump-jamaica.html">Much had changed, including Blair himself</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A ‘Shattered’ Life: </strong>An Indonesian man with a student visa and an American wife thought he would soon get a green card. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/minnesota-student-aditya-harsono-visa.html">Now, he could get deported over a 2022 arrest</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia</strong><strong>:</strong> Four House Democrats traveled to El Salvador to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/abrego-garcia-el-salvador-democrats.html">press for the release of a Maryland resident</a> who was mistakenly deported there.
