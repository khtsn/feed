Local officials threatening to cut off water to illegal vacation rentals. Residents spraying tourists with water pistols.</p><p>With Labor Day, the unofficial end of summer, upon us, European hot spots like Barcelona, Athens and the Greek island of Santorini have reached a breaking point, making tourists the targets of a major backlash. While final visitor numbers for this summer aren’t in, they are expected to surpass 2019 levels; in the second quarter alone, international arrivals exceeded 2019 by six percent, according to the European Travel Commission.</p><p>Climate change has also put tremendous pressure on popular destinations. July was the planet’s 14th consecutive month of record heat, according to the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/earth-just-had-its-warmest-july-on-record" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, and Spain and Greece experienced some of their hottest days on record, with temperatures over 114 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>While tourism is a critical economic driver for many European destinations, some residents argue that more tourism revenue needs to be invested in communities and infrastructure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We have been invaded by tourists; the situation is out of control,” said Camila Guzman, 32, a resident of Palma, on the Spanish island of Majorca. Ms. Guzman participated in the July protests that drew more than 50,000 people. Prices have been pushed up so much, she said, that “we cannot afford to live here anymore.”</p><p>Elsewhere, locals have rallied against disrespectful tourist behavior and new hotel and villa construction. Some places are imposing visitor caps. For example, Île-de-Bréhat, a French island off the coast of Brittany with just 400 residents, recently imposed a limit of 4,700 visitors per day.</p><p>The pandemic, too, exacerbated local grievances after residents got a taste of life without tourists. When travel restrictions were lifted, the crowds came back in droves.</p><p>“This summer is the perfect storm, with a combination of issues, including excessive numbers, bad behavior and climate change,” said Richard Butler, professor emeritus in hospitality and tourism management at the <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/butlerrichardprofessor/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Strathclyde in Glasgow,</a> and the author of several books on overtourism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>At the end of a frenzied summer, we look at some of the breaking points.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>During heat waves, the authorities in Athens limit the opening hours of the Acropolis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aris Oikonomou/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-675e874">Greece</h2><h3 id="link-69375f6"><span>Athens</span></h3><p>The influx of tourists this summer put Athens under tremendous strain as it grappled with excessive heat, as well as water shortages.

Cruise ships — 800 vessels brought in 1.3 million visitors — were a major source of foot traffic, according to the Hellenic Ports Association.</p><p>More recently, residents were outraged when Panagiotis Kavallaris, president of the island’s municipal community, posted on social media, urging locals to limit their movements to accommodate more than 11,000 cruise passengers who were expected to arrive on July 24.
