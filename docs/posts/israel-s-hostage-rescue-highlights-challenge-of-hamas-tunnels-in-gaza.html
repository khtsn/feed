According to two senior officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters, Israeli forces appear to have found Mr. al-Qadi by chance as they were combing through a tunnel network for Hamas fighters.</p><p>It was the second time in two weeks that Hamas’s network of tunnels featured prominently in Israel’s accounts of hostage recovery efforts, shining some light on a mostly unseen aspect of the war that looms large for the country’s military and government officials. Last week, Israeli troops said they had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-bodies-recovered-gaza.html" title="">recovered the bodies of six hostages</a> hidden behind concrete lining in an underground route connected to a 10-meter-deep tunnel shaft.</p><p>These underground discoveries after nearly 11 months of war show just how elaborate and extensive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/10/world/europe/hamas-gaza-tunnels.html" title="">Hamas’s tunnel network</a> has turned out to be, experts say. Some of the tunnels are hundreds of miles long, according to Israeli, Hamas and U.S. officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The tunnels are massive,” said Dan Byman, a senior fellow with the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The war in Gaza has revealed two surprises about the subterranean system that Hamas built, he added: There are more tunnels, and they are more serpentine, than previously believed.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Farhan al-Qadi, a member of Israel’s Bedouin Arab minority, was rescued from an underground Hamas tunnel in southern Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Levy/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The tunnels serve Hamas in multiple ways, Mr. Byman said. Not only can the group hide its leaders and hostages in them, but capturing the tunnels — where Israeli forces are much more vulnerable and have to move very slowly — is far harder than taking a building above ground.</p><p>“The advantage of Israel’s military is tremendous coordination and situational awareness, and in tunnels that’s much harder,” he said.</p><p>Trying to destroy the subterranean system from above is also problematic, Mr. Byman said, because it takes big bombs that cause a lot of damage and potentially risk the lives of hostages hidden in the tunnels. He posited that many of the remaining living hostages were being held underground, perhaps alongside Hamas leaders, given that “they are a very valuable asset” and “one of Hamas’s chief bargaining chips.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Israeli military has tried several tactics during the war to drive Hamas fighters aboveground, including flooding the tunnels and sealing them, said James Wirtz, a professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School. They also regularly explode the tunnel entrances, and send dogs, drones and robots inside them to avoid risking the life of a soldier.</p><p>“It’s horrible,” Mr. Wirtz said. “There are turns and side rooms and booby traps. It’s a hard thing to ask a soldier to do.”</p><p>The Israeli military has said it is making progress in eliminating Hamas’s underground infrastructure. On Aug. 15, the military said it had destroyed about 50 tunnels in a week, and it released video footage of soldiers blowing up burrows and building materials in an area along the border with Egypt that Israel calls the Philadelphi Corridor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In December, Israel said it had found the entrance to a large tunnel a few hundred meters from the Erez border crossing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Making sure that those tunnels and others will not be rebuilt has been a critical issue in the cease-fire negotiations being mediated between Israel and Hamas. Mr. Netanyahu has said he wants some Israeli troops to continue to patrol the Philadelphi Corridor to prevent Hamas from rearming after the war or rebuilding tunnels to Egypt.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>His stated goal is to eliminate Hamas, its leaders and its infrastructure, a mission that some in the Israeli military community have suggested is unrealistic. The Israeli military earlier this month said it had killed 17,000 militants in the war, but troops have repeatedly battled resurgences in areas of Gaza that it had previously declared cleared of Hamas fighters. And some of the militant group’s top leaders have survived.</p><p>In November, a freed Israeli hostage described how Yahya Sinwar, a Hamas leader who is now the group’s political chief, had addressed a large number of Israeli captives underground not long after the Oct. 7 attacks, saying that they were safe and that no harm would come to them. The United States and Israel were working hard at the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/israel-hamas-sinwar.html" title="">to find and capture Mr. Sinwar</a> — and have been trying ever since.</p><p>In January, Israeli commandos raided an elaborate tunnel complex in southern Gaza based on intelligence that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/israel-hamas-sinwar.html" title="">Mr. Sinwar was hiding there</a>. But he had left the underground bunker days earlier and remains at large.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter, based in Washington.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni">More about Ephrat Livni</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The War That Won’t End:</strong> It’s been nearly a year since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. “The Daily” explains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/podcasts/the-daily/israel-gaza-hamas.html">why the conflict is still going</a>, and what it would take to end it.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Spotlight on Israel’s Bedouins:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/who-is-qaid-farhan-al-qadi-israel-hostage.html">Farhan al-Qadi</a>, the hostage rescued by the Israeli military from Gaza, is a member of the Bedouin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostage-bedouin.html">an Arab community marginalized by Israel</a> that suffered painful losses on Oct. 7.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-Iran Nuclear Talks:</strong> Iran’s supreme leader suggested that his country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks-khamenei.html">would pursue nuclear negotiations</a> with the United States, but it was unclear if his comments signaled a shift in relations between the two countries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hamas’s Elusive Leader:</strong> Yahya Sinwar is by far Hamas’s most important figure, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/israel-hamas-sinwar.html">his success in evading capture or death</a> has denied Israel a military success that could help end the war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s Orphans:</strong> The war in Gaza is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-orphans.html">making so many orphans</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-orphans.html"> </a>that no agency or aid group can count them.
