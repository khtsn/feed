Putin of Russia on Monday, days after the first direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in years resulted in a prisoner swap agreement but not a temporary cease-fire. </p><p>Mr. Trump said on Saturday that he would also call President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has agreed to an unconditional and immediate cease-fire, as well as leaders of the NATO alliance.<span>  </span></p><p>“Hopefully it will be a productive day, a cease-fire will take place, and this very violent war — a war that should have never happened — will end,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media.</p><p>The Kremlin confirmed on Saturday evening that the Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would speak, in what is set to be their second publicly acknowledged call in Mr. Trump’s second term to discuss Ukraine. Their first call, in February,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/putin-trump-call-russia-ukraine.html" title=""> was celebrated by many</a> in Moscow, especially after it emerged that Mr. Trump had called Mr. Putin before Mr. Zelensky.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is not the first time Mr. Trump, who said on the campaign trail that he would get the war “settled before I even become president,” has expressed optimism that he could bring it to a swift end. The phone calls are set to take place as the Kremlin has intensified assaults across the front and stepped up bombardments of Ukrainian cities.<span>  </span></p><p>On Saturday morning, a Russian drone attack killed at least nine people after hitting a shuttle bus carrying civilians in the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine, according to local residents and Ukrainian authorities. Attacks in other parts of the country killed at least five more civilians, according to the Ukrainian authorities.</p><p>While Ukrainian and Russian officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">sat down</a> on Friday in Istanbul face to face for the first time since the start of the war — agreeing on a deal to swap 1,000 prisoners each — there is little evidence that the frenetic swirl of diplomatic activity has brought the two sides closer to negotiating a cease-fire.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky condemned the strike on the bus on Saturday as a “deliberate attack on civilians.”</p><p>“The Russians could not have failed to understand what kind of vehicle they were targeting,” he said in a statement. The Russian military did not have any immediate comment on the attack.</p><p>In his statement, Mr. Zelensky said he believed the only way the Kremlin would make peace was if Mr. Putin were forced to do so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“We are expecting strong sanctions against Russia from the United States, from Europe and from all our partners,” Mr. Zelensky said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Saturday that he believed the only way the Kremlin would make peace was if President Vladimir V.

So will Vice President JD Vance, who clashed with the Ukrainian leader in a disastrous meeting in the Oval Office at the end of February.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Vatican could be a venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks after Pope Leo vowed to personally make “every effort” to help end the war.</p><p>Mr. Rubio also spoke on Saturday with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. The Russian foreign ministry said the call was initiated by the American side. The State Department said that Mr. Rubio had emphasized Mr. Trump’s call for “an immediate cease-fire.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Kyiv has long worried that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would come to a mutual understanding and then try to impose their terms on Ukraine. As Washington has moved more in alignment with Moscow’s position, Europe’s leading military powers have reaffirmed their commitment to helping Ukraine defend itself. </p><p>Military analysts and critics of the Trump administration’s policy, including Republicans, have said that pressuring Ukraine while taking no action against Russia was always doomed to failure.</p><p>“I do not believe there is any prospect for the end to the war this year,” Mick Ryan, a retired Australian general and fellow at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based research group, said in an interview. “Russia has maintained, and doubled down, on its maximalist goals, reinforcing them in negotiations in Turkey this week.”</p><p>The focus on territorial gains and demands, which is mainly what the White House has been focused on, misses the point, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Mr. Putin’s primary goal is snuffing out Ukraine’s democracy and culture, denying it agency in its own affairs,” Mr. Ryan said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Russian strike last month in Sumy, Ukraine, in which at least 35 people were killed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Serhii, 44, a volunteer in Sumy who on Saturday helped rescue people injured in the bus attack, said he felt betrayed by the Trump administration’s diplomatic efforts. Asking that his family name not be used out of concern for their safety, he said, “Everything Trump is doing — or not doing — leads to more destruction, the collapse of peace.”</p><p>Viktor Vovk, 60, was driving the bus and had just pulled away from a checkpoint when the drone struck.</p><p>“I didn’t even realize what had happened at first,” he said when reached by phone as he recovered from his injuries. But then he turned his head and saw bodies torn apart and others trapped in the wreckage.</p><p>“God help you never have to see something like that,” he said.</p><p>The nine people who were killed included a family — a father, mother and daughter, Ukrainian authorities said. At least seven more people were injured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The bus was struck by a Russian Lancet drone at 6:17 a.m. local time outside Bilopillia, a few miles from the Russian border, which had a prewar population of roughly 15,000 people.</p><p>Oleksandr Merezhko, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said Saturday’s bloodshed was further evidence of a failed American policy.</p><p>He pointed out that Mr. Trump had demanded an immediate, unconditional cease-fire for 30 days, which Mr. Zelensky accepted even though Kyiv had long insisted that security guarantees precede any truce. He then called on Mr. Zelensky to take up Mr. Putin’s offer to restart direct negotiations in Istanbul, but then undercut those talks, saying that only he and Mr. Putin together could resolve the war.</p><p>“Such inconsistency, illogical steps and lack of strategy undermine U.S. credibility and encourage Putin to continue to insist on his maximalist demands,” Mr. Merezhko said. “Putin has outmaneuvered Trump.”</p><p>Nataliia Novosolova<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>May 17, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament’s foreign affairs committee.
