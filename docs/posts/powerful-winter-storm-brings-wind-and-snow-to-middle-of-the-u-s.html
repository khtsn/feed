Laura Kelly of Kansas declared a state of emergency in the state on Saturday afternoon, as officials braced for the storm to worsen.</p><p>The Kansas City region was under a blizzard warning until 3 a.m. on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, which predicted that the area would be blanketed by nine to 14 inches of snow and face wind gusts of up to 40 miles per hour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Travel could be very difficult to impossible,” the service said <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=EAX&amp;wwa=blizzard%20warning" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an update.</a></p><p>The airport’s closure delayed a Kansas City Chiefs team flight to Denver by about three hours but the team was in the air by 5:30 p.m. local time, Brad Gee, a spokesman for the Chiefs, said. The Chiefs were scheduled to play the Broncos on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>The storm was also wreaking havoc on the state’s highways.</p><p>In a video filmed near a rolled-over semi on Interstate 135 in Kansas and posted on social media, Trooper Ben Gardner of the Kansas Highway Patrol <a href="https://x.com/TrooperBenKHP/status/1875613718169710762" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that the highway</a> was “very, very slick” and that “it’s not getting any better.”</p><p>“Get off the roads,” he said. “Don’t be on ’em because it’s not good and it might result in something really bad happening. Stay home.”</p><p>An icy, 18-mile section of Interstate 70 closed at about 3 p.m. because of crashes and spinoffs said Kim Stich, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Transportation. Earlier in the day, another three-mile section of the highway closed but then reopened.</p><p>The storm was forecast to intensify in Kansas and then move east along Interstate 70, bringing heavy snow and blistering cold along a band in the Midwest and then to the Mid-Atlantic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Several states on the storm’s path, including <a href="https://mailchi.mp/fc3a9ef38bae/media-advisory-sanders-to-deliver-welcome-remarks-at-the-arkansas-department-of-education-summer-conference-10336704?e=3c8593d2a6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arkansas</a>, <a href="https://www.kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=GovernorBeshear&amp;prId=2374" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kentucky</a> and <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/january/name-1038336-en.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Virginia</a>, declared states of emergency in anticipation of its arrival.
