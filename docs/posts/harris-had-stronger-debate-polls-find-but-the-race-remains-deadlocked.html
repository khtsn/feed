</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But even that was not enough to jostle a race that appears destined to become a battle of inches this fall, after a summer of tumult and upheaval.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Nationally, Mr. Trump and Ms. Harris are knotted at 47 percent. In Pennsylvania, Ms. Harris leads, 50 percent to 46 percent. The surveys were conducted almost entirely before the second apparent assassination attempt against Mr. Trump last Sunday.</p><p><em>[Follow </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title=""><em>the latest polls</em></a><em> and see updated </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title=""><em>polling averages of the Harris vs. Trump matchup</em></a><em>.]</em></p><p>The first 2024 general election debate, between Mr. Trump and President Biden in June, upended the race, with Democrats so thoroughly losing faith in Mr. Biden’s ability at the age of 81 to campaign and serve a second term that the party switched candidates.</p><p>The new polls show how quickly Democrats consolidated behind Ms. Harris and eliminated what had once appeared to be a daunting enthusiasm gap.</p><p>But Ms. Harris still has some critical vulnerabilities heading into the fall, most notably that far more voters see her as too liberal than view Mr. Trump as too conservative.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The share of voters who said they still wanted to learn more about Ms. Harris was nearly identical, both before and after the debate, suggesting that she might have missed an opportunity to address doubts or provide more details to the public.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I wanted to see how she would answer questions at the debate, but I feel like she didn’t really answer any of the questions; she kind of just deflected,” said Tyler Slabaugh, 24, who works in medical sales and lives in Grand Haven, Mich. He didn’t vote in 2020 but plans on supporting Mr. Trump this year. “I didn’t really get a good understanding of, like, what her plan was,” he said of Ms. Harris.</p><p>Concerns about the state of the economy remain widespread. In Pennsylvania, 77 percent of likely voters said the economy was poor or fair, with only 22 percent calling it excellent or good. That negative view held true even in key Democratic regions, including Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs.</p><p>Mr. Trump has his own challenges, including among the college-educated white voters who populate such suburbs. His support among that group has sunk to 36 percent both nationally and in Pennsylvania. In 2020, he won 42 percent of this group, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of verified 2020 voters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“He continues to just fly off the rails and ramble, which, again, is not something that I look for in the leader of the free world,” said Paul Irwin-Dudek, 47, a nonprofit executive in Nutley, N.J., who is supporting Ms. Harris. “She was able to command the room,” he said of the debate.</p><p>The fact that Ms. Harris was stronger in Pennsylvania than she was nationally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/upshot/harris-trump-poll-pennsylvania.html" title="">is surprising</a>. It has been among the most contested states since 2016 and has generally trended more Republican than the nation has overall.</p><p>But in 2024, Democrats — first with Mr. Biden and now Ms. Harris — have showed relative strength with white voters, and the Pennsylvania electorate is whiter than the nation overall.</p><p>Ms. Harris was winning 46 percent of white voters in Pennsylvania in the new set of polls. In 2020, Mr. Biden won 43 percent of white voters nationally; Hillary Clinton received just 39 percent support from the group in 2016.</p><p>The new polls are in line with other surveys, which show Ms. Harris’s favorability rating rising in the state. Only 42 percent of<span>  </span>voters had rated her favorably in Pennsylvania in early July; now that figure stands at 51 percent — a remarkable improvement. Pennsylvanians have been bombarded by heavy advertising both for and against Ms. Harris ever since her entrance into the race on July 21.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-12"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="table-margins" data-id="100000009704697" data-source-id="100000009704697"><div data-sourceid="100000009704697" id="embed-id-100000009704697">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>One of Ms. Harris’s key tasks in the debate was to introduce herself to the sizable share of the electorate who felt they needed to learn more about her. About half of debate watchers, including nearly half of independent voters, said they had learned a lot, or some, about Ms. Harris during the debate.</p><p>But there has been little movement, with 25 percent of voters still saying they feel they need to learn more about her, down just a few percentage points.</p><p>The debate may have solidified some voters’ concerns that Mr. Trump is just a typical Washington politician. The share of voters who said he represents “more of the same” ticked up slightly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Still, more voters consistently see Mr. Trump as the change candidate. But it is not clear that they like the kind of change he promises to usher in.</p><p>A narrow 51 percent majority said he would “bring about the right kind of change” compared with 49 percent for Ms. Harris — a virtual tie that amounts to a political victory for the incumbent party at a moment of such widespread dissatisfaction.</p><p>Mr. Trump got higher marks than Ms. Harris for saying what he believes, and being respected by foreign leaders.</p><p>Ms. Harris widened the gap with Mr. Trump on intelligence. In August, Pennsylvania voters were 10 percentage points more likely to say “intelligent” described Ms. Harris “well” as compared with Mr. Trump. After the debate, that gap is now 18 percentage points.</p><p>The polls underscore a sharp contrast in the ways voters view the two candidates. Mr. Trump took the title as the more “extreme” candidate, 74 percent versus 46 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Yet being extreme was not viewed negatively by many voters. In fact, Mr. Trump won the group of voters who said “extreme” described him “somewhat well” by more than 50 percentage points.</p><p>The overall results looked much the same when third-party candidates were included in the survey, with Mr. Trump and Ms. Harris tied at 46 percent nationally, and Ms. Harris leading by four percentage points in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Ms. Harris has made gains in that state with college-educated voters, increasingly a Democratic stronghold. In particular, she has improved her standing among college-educated nonwhite voters, a small but crucial sliver of the state.</p><p>Her support among Black voters in Pennsylvania has ticked up steadily since she joined the race. And in Philadelphia, her support among Black voters is at nearly 90 percent, matching some of the strength that Mr. Biden showed with the group in 2020.</p><p>Pennsylvania is also home to one of this year’s most hotly contested Senate races. Senator Bob Casey, the incumbent Democrat, continues to hold a sizable lead over his Republican challenger, David McCormick. Mr. McCormick has closed the gap slightly since August, from being down 14 percentage points to nine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Mr. McCormick is still running behind Mr. Trump in the state, though the number of ticket splitters — voters who were planning to support Mr. Casey and Mr. Trump — has been cut in half, from 4 percent to 2.</p><p>Camille Baker<!-- --> and <!-- -->Christine Zhang<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-73d2d4b7"><span>Here are the key things to know about these polls:</span></h3><ul><li><p>Interviewers spoke with 2,437 likely voters from Sept. 11 to 16, 2024.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Times/Siena polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish.

The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region.

The Pennsylvania poll’s margin of error among likely voters is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error.
