Such a desire is often related to some youthful romanticism or, in some cases, a kind of mental disorder.</p><p>In Ukraine the defense of our country was the fatal necessity that prompted most of us to take up arms. And we’ve held the line for three years (or, to be more precise, almost 11 years).</p><p>We have held the line, despite what it has done to our bodies and our lives. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/europe/ukrainian-war-dead.html#:~:text=President%20Volodymyr%20Zelensky%20said%20on,began%20nearly%20three%20years%20ago." title="">Tens of thousands</a> have been killed, and many more have been injured — like the soldiers in these images.

The whole world knows who started this war. I’m not entirely clear whom Mr. Trump is speaking to, but he’s not speaking to Ukrainians.<strong> </strong>All we can do is fight on and defend our right to exist.</p><p>I am often asked how long Ukraine will stand, since it is obvious that it cannot stand endlessly. And Russia seems ready to fight forever — to the last Russian soldier and the last Ukrainian city. Are Ukrainians ready to sit down at the negotiating table? <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/653495/half-ukrainians-quick-negotiated-end-war.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yes</a>. But as an equal member of the negotiations. Otherwise, it’s like a trial in which the judge and the accused decide the fate of the injured party.</p><p>This is, after all, a war about Ukraine’s right to choose its future. Power and money decide many things, but I hope the world is not ready to give up on concepts like honor and justice.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andrii Tkachuk, an infantryman and machine-gunner in the 112th Territorial Defense Brigade, said he lost his leg near the front line in March 2023. “After three years of war, there aren’t many hopes left, really,” he said. “I just hope to bury as few of my comrades as possible.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><hr/><p>Everyone is so tired.

Never.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><hr/><p>We are not ready to end the war on Russia’s terms and let our society fall into collective depression in the constant expectation of a new attack from a rested, better-prepared Russia. And we don’t want to continue to be a buffer between totalitarian Russia and a well-fed, safe Europe, either. For Ukraine to be a bargaining chip in a complex negotiation with a barbaric dictatorship that blackmails the rest of the civilized world with nuclear tantrums is unacceptable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>I said I was often asked how long Ukraine will stand.
