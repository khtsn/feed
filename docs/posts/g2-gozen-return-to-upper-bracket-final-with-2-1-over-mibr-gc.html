		<p>G2 Gozen have defeated MIBR GC 2-1, and are now in the Game Changers 2024 Championship upper bracket final. This is the third year in a row the organization has done so, the only team in the event&#39;s history to accomplish such a feat.</p>

<p>The match began with MIBR winning Bind, their map pick, 13-8. G2 took their own map, Split, 13-8, sending the series to a decider map. In the end, Gozen dominated Sunset with a 13-4, closing out the match 2-1.</p>

<p>MIBR remain in contention, and they will next play against ZETA Division GC in the lower bracket. </p>
