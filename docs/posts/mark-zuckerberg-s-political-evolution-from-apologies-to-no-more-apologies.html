Trump, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of the social network, wrote an apologetic post.</p><p>In his message, Mr. Zuckerberg announced a series of steps he planned to take to grapple with false and misleading information on Facebook, such as working with fact-checkers.</p><p>“The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103269806149061" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote</a> in a personal Facebook post. “There are many respected fact checking organizations,” he added, “and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more.”</p><p>Eight years later, Mr. Zuckerberg is no longer apologizing. On Tuesday, he announced that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/technology/facebook-fake-news.html" title="">ending its fact-checking program</a> and getting back to its roots around free expression. The fact-checking system had led to “too much censorship,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was the latest step in a transformation of Mr. Zuckerberg. In recent years, the chief executive, now 40, has stepped away from his mea culpa approach to problems on his social platforms. Fed up with what has seemed at times to be unceasing criticism of his company, he has told executives close to him that he wants to return to his original thinking on free speech, which involves a lighter hand in content moderation.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg has remolded Meta as he has made the shift. Gone is the CrowdTangle transparency tool, which allowed researchers, academics and journalists to monitor conspiracy theories and misinformation on Facebook. The company’s election integrity team, once trumpeted as a group of experts focused solely on issues around the vote, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/technology/meta-election-politics.html" title="">has been folded into a general integrity team</a>.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Zuckerberg has promoted technology efforts at Meta, including its investments in the immersive world of the so-called metaverse and its focus on artificial intelligence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Meta Store in Burlingame, Calif.

Photos of him uncomfortably clad in a suit and tie and testifying before Congress have been replaced by videos of him with longer hair and in gold chains, competing in extreme sports and sometimes hunting for his own food. Long, heavily lawyered Facebook posts about Meta’s commitment to democracy no longer appear. Instead, he has posted quips on Threads responding to celebrity athletes and videos showing the company’s newest A.I. initiatives.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This shows how Mark Zuckerberg is feeling that society is more accepting of those libertarian and right-leaning viewpoints that he’s always had,” said Katie Harbath, chief executive of Anchor Change, a tech consulting firm, who previously worked at Facebook. “This is an evolved return to his political origins.”</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg has long been a pragmatist who has gone where the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/business/meta-fact-checking/mark-zuckerbergs-history-of-moving-meta-toward-where-the-political-wind-blows?smid=url-share" title="">political winds have blown</a>. He has flip-flopped on how much political content should be shown to Facebook and Instagram users, previously saying social networks should be about fun, relatable content from family and friends but then on Tuesday saying Meta would show more personalized political content.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg has told executives close to him that he is comfortable with the new direction of his company. He sees his most recent steps as a return to his original thinking on free speech and free expression, with Meta limiting its monitoring and controlling of content, said two Meta executives who spoke with Mr. Zuckerberg in the last week.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg was never comfortable with the involvement of outside fact-checkers, academics or researchers in his company, one of the executives said. He now sees many of the steps taken after the 2016 election as a mistake, the two executives said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1525382954801931" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> on Tuesday about the end of the fact-checking program, echoing statements made by top Republicans over the years.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An advocacy group displayed cardboard cutouts of Mr. Zuckerberg outside the U.S. Capitol in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Meta declined to comment.</p><p>Those who have known Mr. Zuckerberg for decades describe him as a natural libertarian, who enjoyed reading books extolling free expression and the free market system after he dropped out of Harvard to start Facebook in 2004. As his company grew, so did pressure to become more responsive to complaints from world leaders and civil society groups that he was not doing enough to moderate content on his platform.</p><p>Crises including a genocide in Myanmar, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" title="">in which Facebook was blamed</a> for allowing hate speech to spread against the Muslim Rohingya people, forced Mr. Zuckerberg to expand moderation teams and define rules around speech on his social networks.</p><p>He was coached by people close to him, including Meta’s former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to become more involved in politics. After the 2016 election, Mr. Zuckerberg embarked on a public campaign to clear his name and redeem his company. He held regular meetings with civic leaders and invited politicians to visit his company’s headquarters, rolled out transparency tools such as CrowdTangle and brought on fact-checkers.</p><p>In 2017, he announced that he was conducting a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/technology/zuckerberg-harvard-commencement-road-trip.html" title="">“listening tour”</a> across the United States to “get a broader perspective” on how Americans used Facebook. The campaign-like photo opportunities with farmers and autoworkers led to speculation that he was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/mark-zuckerberg-could-be-running-for-president-in-2020.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">running for political office.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Despite his efforts, Mr. Zuckerberg continued to be blamed for the misinformation and falsehoods that spread on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>In October 2019, Mr. Zuckerberg began to push back. In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/zuckerberg-facebook-free-speech.html" title="">address at Georgetown University</a>, he said Facebook had been founded to give people a voice.</p><p>“I’m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression,” he said.</p><p>In 2021, when the Jan. 6 riot broke out at the U.S. Capitol after the presidential election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/02/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-memo.html" title="">Meta was again held responsible</a> for hosting speech that fomented the violence. Two weeks later, Mr. Zuckerberg told investors that the company was “considering steps” to reduce political content across Facebook.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The headquarters of Meta, which Mr. Zuckerberg recently said could need a decade to get its brand back to where he wanted it. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jason Henry for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>His evolution since then has been steady. Executives who pushed Mr. Zuckerberg to involve himself directly in politics, including Ms. Sandberg, have left the company. Those closest to him now cheer his focus on his own interests, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/technology/dana-white-meta-board-ufc.html" title="">include extreme sports</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/style/mark-zuckerberg-tpain-get-low.html" title="">rapping for his wife</a>, as well as promoting his company’s A.I. initiatives.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/technology/mark-zuckerberg-podcast-acquired.html" title="">podcast interview</a> in San Francisco that Mr. Zuckerberg recorded live in front of an audience of 6,000 in September, he spoke for nearly 90 minutes about his love of technology. He said he should have rejected accusations that his company was responsible for societal ills.</p><p>“I think that the political miscalculation was a 20-year mistake,” he said. He added that it could take another decade for him to move his company’s brand back to where he wanted it.</p><p>“We’ll get through it, and we’ll come out stronger,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sheera Frenkel is a reporter based in the San Francisco Bay Area, covering the ways technology impacts everyday lives with a focus on social media companies, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram and WhatsApp.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sheera-frenkel">More about Sheera Frenkel</a></span></p></div><div><p>Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent for The Times based in San Francisco.
