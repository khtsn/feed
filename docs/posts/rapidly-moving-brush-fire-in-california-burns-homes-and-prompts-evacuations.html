Trevor Johnson of the Fire Department. He added, “Our firefighters are doing nothing short of heroic out there right now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Jeff Shea, a division chief with the department, pointed out that the region was experiencing critically low moisture in the air and wind gusts as high as 80 miles per hour, conditions that were expected to continue through Thursday.</p><p>The fast-moving blaze broke out about 9 a.m. on Wednesday and caught many residents off guard.</p><p>Gail Liacko, who lives in Camarillo, had risen early on Wednesday and went outside in her pajamas to tend to her roses. Their petals had been shredded by the intense wind throughout the night, but Ms. Liacko said she thought nothing of it. She then sat down to a breakfast of homemade hash browns and eggs, prepared by her husband, Michael.</p><p>“We were relaxing and I went outside again, and I started smelling smoke and noticed soot on our back patio cushions,” said Ms. Liacko, a real estate agent. “That made me nervous, because that means embers.”</p><p>Within the hour, the couple found themselves rushing throughout the ranch-style home that they purchased nine years ago, frantically grabbing photos and important documents. They made it safely to a friend’s house, but there was no power, so they were unable to watch the news.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/06/multimedia/06xp-californiafire-qftp/06xp-californiafire-qftp-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Firefighters battled strong winds and dangerous weather conditions in Southern California on Wednesday in an attempt to control two wildfires in the region.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Ethan Swope/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In the afternoon, Ms. Liacko, who is in her early 60s, received a text from a neighbor. At least one of the homes on their street was on fire.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Oh god, I’m sick to my stomach, this is really real,” she said.</p><p>Evacuation orders were in effect for parts of Ventura County, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. It was not clear how many residents had been ordered to evacuate.</p><p>At Padre Serra Parish in Camarillo, a Catholic church and the city’s designated evacuation shelter, some residents stood in the parking lot gazing out at the smoke billowing like clouds in the air.</p><p>Inside, dozens of people sat around banquet tables while children lay on blankets. A city official advised them to make plans to stay the night or seek another safe place.</p><p>A few were parishioners of the church and felt comfortable staying.</p><p>CaroleAnn Higa sat beside her oxygen tank waiting for a nurse to bring medication to help calm allergies triggered by pets brought into the church.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Higa, 77, arrived with one extra shirt, an inhaler and her wallet. When she drove away from her home in Camarillo where she has lived for four years, it was unrecognizable.</p><p>“I looked up the hill, I could not believe the smoke that was there. It was so thick you could not even see the house,” she said. “We’re praying because the road that we’re on, we have a fire hydrant.”</p><p>Nearby was Peter Siudera, 82, who has lived in Camarillo for nearly five decades. He planned to spend the night in the shelter.</p><p>“I don’t really have any place to go. It’s just me,” he said. When he was preparing to evacuate, he found himself trying to answer impossible questions.</p><p>“I went around to each of the bedrooms and said, ‘What can burn, and what do I want to replace?’ Mr. Siudera said. “And that was a hard decision, I was kind of shaking. You wonder if you’re going to come back again and see it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Among those who fled were forecasters at the National Weather Service’s office in Oxnard, Calif., which is responsible for warning residents about hazardous weather conditions in Southern California.</p><p>The affected area is dotted with nurseries, farms and horse ranches.</p><p>“It’s a very big horse community, everybody knows each other pretty much,” said Kat Winters, 52, the manager of an equine hospital in the area. “We got a lot of phone calls from clients wanting to bring trailers to us and were willing and were kind — we’re very fortunate.”</p><p>Ms. Winters and about a dozen staff members had spent the morning rounding up X-ray machines, computers and medicine while transporting horses — some of them rehabilitating from injuries unrelated to the fire and reliant on intravenous fluids — to a safer area.</p><p>“It’s a little nerve-racking,” she said. “We’re hoping everything is there when we get back.”</p><p>The Mountain fire, was zero percent contained by Wednesday evening, according to fire officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2022-wildfire-embed-embed-mountain_ventura_ca" data-id="100000009812926" data-source-id="100000009812926"><div slug="2022-wildfire-embed-embed-mountain_ventura_ca" data-sourceid="100000009812926" id="embed-id-100000009812926">

The fire, which had affected at least two structures, was 15 percent contained by the afternoon, according to California fire officials.</p><p>In Northern California, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric announced a power shut-off on Wednesday to prevent further wildfires in vulnerable areas. Southern California Edison took the same approach, and about 16,000 customers across Los Angeles and Ventura Counties were without power as of Wednesday evening, according to <a href="https://poweroutage.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poweroutage.us</a>, which tracks data from utility companies.</p><p>Meteorologists warned that weather conditions, which were dry and windy on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/weather/los-angeles-santa-ana-winds-california.html" title="">were ripe for fires to spread rapidly</a>. The two counties were under red-flag warnings through Friday, and the Weather Service warned residents of a “particularly dangerous situation.”</p><p>Parts of Southern California could see damaging wind gusts of up to 80 miles per hour, which could down trees and cause power outages in addition to spreading the flames, the Weather Service said. Parts of Ventura County were also under a dense smoke advisory, meaning that smoke in the area could make driving conditions dangerous.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A firefighter on Wednesday in front of a home in Camarillo, Calif., destroyed by the Mountain fire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Etienne Laurent/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jesus Jiménez covers breaking news, online trends and other subjects.
