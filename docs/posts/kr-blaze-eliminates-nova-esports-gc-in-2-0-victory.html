</span>, KRÜ BLAZE won its second straight game in the lower bracket to reach the lower bracket quarterfinals.</p>

<p>Split began with both teams running slightly different variations of a double-Controller composition, with the Viper, Raze, and Omen staying the same, but with Nova running Deadlock and Fade while KRÜ ran the two healers: Skye and Sage. Starting on the attack side, Nova won the pistol and converted the bonus thanks to clem, stretching that early advantage to a 4-1 lead. KRÜ fought back off some strong rounds from <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/25663/dods">
		dods	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/11235/biazik">
		biazik	</a>
</span>, tying the map at 4-4 and taking a 7-5 lead at the half.</p>

<p>Nova won the second pistol to tie the game at 7-7, but was unable to convert the bonus. Just like the first half, the map was close, as the game reached a 9-9 tie off back-to-back thriftys. Nova was the team that started that momentum to try and end the map, reaching a 12-9 lead, but KRÜ forced the map to OT off a late hit from Nova crumbling to pieces. </p>

<p>Nova took the first OT advantage and reached map point again, but KRÜ were tenacious thanks to a glass cannon Operator buy from dods to extend OT. </p>


<p><em>dods snipes three with the Operator in OT.</em></p>

<p>After KRÜ took an advantage and lost, the third OT cycle ended with KRÜ winning two rounds and ending the map 16-14.</p>

<p>Next up was Haven, which was the map pick from Nova in the series. Yet again, both teams ran similar compositions with small changes, as Nova ran a double-Controller composition with Neon and Sova, while KRÜ opted for Waylay and Fade. Nova started strong with its third straight pistol win of the series, but KRÜ won the eco thanks to <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/11259/conir">
		conir	</a>
</span> shooting two down with a Classic combined with a fast dods flank. That moment proved to mean a lot for the attack of Nova, as KRÜ proceeded to win 10 straight rounds to enter the half up 10-2. </p>

<p>KRÜ winning its first pistol almost killed all hope for Nova, but a force buy on the eco round did manage to scrounge up a couple of round wins. However, the hole that was dug in the first half proved to be too much to climb out of, as KRÜ won Haven 13-4 to sweep the series.</p>

<p>Sticking with Viper throughout the match, the star player of the series was <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/12055/mmonch">
		mmonch	</a>
</span> from KRÜ. They ended the series with a 1.43 match rating, 43 kills, 285 ACS, and 184 ADR, with an amazing map performance on Haven.</p>

<p>With this win, KRÜ will move on to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581499/kr-blaze-vs-tbd-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr3" target="_blank">face the loser of the G2 Gozen and Team Liquid Brazil match</a>. As for Nova Esports GC, that was the end of its tournament run, only winning the first match of the event.</p>
