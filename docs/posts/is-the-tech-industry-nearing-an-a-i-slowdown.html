Interviews with 20 executives and researchers showed a widespread belief that the tech industry is running into a problem many would have thought was unthinkable just a few years ago: They have used up most of the digital text available on the internet.</p><p>That problem is starting to surface even as billions of dollars continue to be poured into A.I. development. On Tuesday, Databricks, an A.I. data company, said it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/technology/databricks-funding-venture-capital-deals.html" title="">was closing in on $10 billion</a> in funding — the largest-ever private funding round for a start-up. And the biggest companies in tech are signaling that they have no plans to slow down their spending on the giant data centers that run A.I. systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demis Hassabis oversees Google DeepMind, the company’s primary A.I. lab.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alastair Grant/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Not everyone in the A.I. world is concerned. Some, like OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, say that progress will continue at the same pace, albeit with some twists on old techniques. Dario Amodei, the chief executive of the A.I. start-up Anthropic, and Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, are also bullish.</p><p>(The New York Times has sued OpenAI, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI has denied the claims.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The roots of the debate trace back to 2020 when Jared Kaplan, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, published a research paper showing that large language models steadily grew more powerful and lifelike as they analyzed more data.</p><p>Researchers called Dr. Kaplan’s findings “the Scaling Laws.” Just as students learn more by reading more books, A.I. systems improved as they ingested increasingly large amounts of digital text culled from the internet, including news articles, chat logs and computer programs. Seeing the raw power of this phenomenon, companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta raced to get their hands on as much internet data as possible, cutting corners, ignoring corporate policies and even debating whether they should skirt the law, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/technology/tech-giants-harvest-data-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">an examination this year by The New York Times</a>.</p><p>It was the modern equivalent of Moore’s Law, the oft-quoted maxim coined in the 1960s by the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. He showed that the number of transistors on a silicon chip doubled every two years or so, steadily increasing the power of the world’s computers. Moore’s Law held up for 40 years. But eventually, it started to slow.</p><p>The problem is, neither the Scaling Laws nor Moore’s Law are immutable laws of nature. They’re simply smart observations. One held up for decades. The others may have a much shorter shelf life. Google and Dr. Kaplan’s new employer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/technology/anthropic-funding-ai.html" title="">Anthropic</a>, cannot just throw more text at their A.I. systems because there is little text left to throw.</p><p>“There were extraordinary returns over the last three or four years as the Scaling Laws were getting going,” Dr. Hassabis said. “But we are no longer getting the same progress.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dr. Hassabis said that existing techniques would continue to improve A.I. in some ways. But he said he believed that entirely new ideas were needed to reach the goal that Google and many others were chasing: a machine that could match the power of the human brain.</p><p>Ilya Sutskever, who was instrumental in pushing the industry to think big as a researcher at both Google and OpenAI before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/technology/ilya-sutskever-leaving-openai.html" title="">leaving OpenAI to create a new start-up this spring</a>, made the same point <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320811/what-ilya-sutskever-sees-openai-model-data-training" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">during a speech last week</a>. “We’ve achieved peak data, and there’ll be no more,” he said. “We have to deal with the data that we have. There’s only one internet.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We’ve achieved peak data, and there’ll be no more,” said Ilya Sutskever, the former chief scientist of OpenAI. “We have to deal with the data that we have.

They are developing ways for large language models to learn from their own trial and error. By working through various math problems, for instance, language models can learn which methods lead to the right answer and which do not. In essence, the models train on data that they themselves generate. Researchers call this “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/technology/ai-data-tech-companies.html" title="">synthetic data</a>.”</p><p>OpenAI recently released a new system called OpenAI o1 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/technology/openai-chatgpt-math.html" title="">was built this way</a>. But the method only works in areas like math and computing programming, where there <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/technology/ai-chatbots-chatgpt-math.html" title="">is a firm distinction between right and wrong</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Even in these areas, A.I. systems <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html" title="">have a way</a> of making mistakes and making things up. That can hamper efforts to build A.I. “agents” that can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/technology/ai-agents-workers-replace.html" title="">write their own computer programs and take actions on behalf of internet users</a>, which experts see as one of A.I.’s most important skills.</p><p>Sorting through the wider expanses of human knowledge is even more difficult.</p><p>“These methods only work in areas where things are empirically true, like math and science,” said Dylan Patel, chief analyst for the research firm SemiAnalysis, who closely follows the rise of A.I. technologies. “The humanities and the arts, moral and philosophical problems are much more difficult.”</p><p>People like Mr. Altman of OpenAI say that these new techniques will continue to push the technology ahead. But if progress reaches a plateau, the implications could be far-reaching, even for Nvidia, which has become one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to the A.I. boom.</p><p>During a call with analysts last month, Mr. Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, was asked how the company was helping customers work through a potential slowdown and what the repercussions might be for its business. He said that evidence showed there were still gains being made, but that businesses were also testing new processes and techniques on A.I. chips.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, says customers are still testing new A.I.-building techniques on his company’s chips.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ann Wang/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“As a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great,” Mr. Huang said.</p><p>Though he is confident about Nvidia’s prospects, some of the company’s biggest customers acknowledge that they must prepare for the possibility that A.I. will not advance as quickly as expected.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“We have had to grapple with this.
