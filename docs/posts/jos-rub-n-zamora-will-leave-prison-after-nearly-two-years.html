He called the charges politically motivated and said they were retaliation for his newspaper’s focus on public corruption.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As part of his detention outside jail, he will be required to report periodically to the authorities and remain confined in his home.</p><p>His trial was plagued with irregularities and was broadly seen as fundamentally unfair — another move to undermine democracy and target critical press coverage during the administration of former President Alejandro Giammattei.</p><p>Months later, an appeals court overturned his conviction and sent the case back for a retrial. But prosecutors appealed that decision, and Mr. Zamora remained in pretrial detention. The appeals court is now weighing whether to grant him a new trial.</p><p>Although he was granted house arrest for his money laundering case in August, Mr. Zamora was kept in prison because he faced another pretrial detention order for a second case related to obstruction of justice and falsification of documents.</p><p>Friday’s ruling means that, for now, he’ll be able to confront those charges in freedom.</p><p>The Guatemalan government came under new leadership in January after Bernardo Arévalo, an anticorruption crusader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/20/world/americas/arevalo-wins-election-guatemala.html" title="">won a runoff election</a> for president. The shift in power translated into slightly better conditions for Mr. Zamora.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The lights in his tiny cell were fixed. The glass on three small windows was replaced to keep out insects and prevent the cold from seeping in. He was given nail clippers and scissors.</p><p>And his family was allowed to take him an electronic tablet that he used to listen to music and watch some TV shows.</p><p>But while the new presidential administration is considered more progressive and supportive of democratic norms, Mr. Zamora’s case had until recently been overseen by prosecutors and judges allied with Mr. Giammattei.</p><p>Last week, a new slate of judges, including high court magistrates, was appointed. Some of them are considered to be independent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Among those who have tried to keep Mr. Zamora behind bars are the country’s attorney general, María Consuelo Porras, the leader of the special prosecutor’s office against impunity, Rafael Curruchiche, and a far-right group, the Foundation Against Terrorism.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rafael Curruchiche leads the special prosecutor’s office against impunity, which handled Mr. Zamora’s case.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniele Volpe for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Both Ms. Porras and Mr. Curruchiche also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/world/americas/guatemala-president-elect-arevalo.html" title="">used repeated legal challenges</a> to try to block an orderly transition of power. They have been placed on a list of corrupt Central American officials by the United States, accused of graft and undermining democratic institutions.</p><p>Mr. Curruchiche’s office, which sought a 40-year prison sentence for Mr. Zamora, tried to suspend Friday’s hearing by not showing up. The Foundation Against Terrorism, or Fundaterror, which supports the attorney general, also claimed that the judge was not impartial.</p><p>“The pattern is always the same,” Mr. Zamora said in an interview. “Every time they assign me a judge, Fundaterror proceeds to file complaints against the judges. It says that I have bribed them, that I have made deals with them — judges that I have never seen and do not know.”</p><p>These tactics have allowed the public prosecutor’s office in Guatemala to obstruct hearings and keep journalists, anticorruption prosecutors and human rights activists in pretrial detention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But they were not enough to stop Judge Erick García Alvarado from deciding on Friday that Mr. Zamora’s time in prison had exceeded the limits established by law and that his release was needed “for human rights reasons.”</p><p>Many across Guatemala applauded the ruling, including the country’s president. “Zamora returns home,” Mr. Arévalo said on social media. “Justice begins to arrive, the dark cycle will end.”</p><p>Still, despite Mr. Zamora’s expected release, “justice is far from achieved yet in this case,” said Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York. “He shouldn’t have spent a single hour imprisoned.”</p><p>Mr. Zamora’s defense was hamstrung at various steps from the beginning.</p><p>He cycled through several defense lawyers, at least four of whom were accused of obstructing justice, prosecuted, detained and pressured into accepting the charges against them. </p><p>And a judge who handled the case earlier in the process did not allow Mr. Zamora to present any witnesses and rejected most of the evidence he tried to submit, deeming it irrelevant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“There are strong grounds to conclude that the proceedings against Mr. Zamora were initiated in retaliation for his longstanding work to expose government corruption,” said <a href="https://cfj.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/guatemala-v-zamora-report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report by TrialWatch</a>, a global initiative that monitors criminal trials worldwide.</p><p>“Should a retrial occur,” the report added, “it must strictly adhere to international standards, ensuring a different panel of judges who are demonstrably impartial and independent, free from any external pressures.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emiliano-rodriguez-mega">More about Emiliano Rodríguez Mega</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Lifeline in Lebanon: </strong>Thousands have fled the town of Baalbek amid a barrage of Israeli airstrikes.
