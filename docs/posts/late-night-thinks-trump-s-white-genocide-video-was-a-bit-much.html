Here are the </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/arts/television/best-movies-on-netflix.html" title=""><em>50 best movies on Netflix right now</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="link-2f293704">Lie, the Beloved Country</h2><p>On Wednesday, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-ramaphosa-south-africa-visit.html" title="">lectured</a> the visiting president of South Africa, claiming that genocide was being carried out against white farmers in his country (and subjecting him to a dubious video on that subject). In turn, Trump got a lecture from late-night hosts, who dismantled his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-south-africa-president-white-farmers-video.html" title="">false claims</a>.</p><p>“There’s a right-wing conspiracy theory bubbling right now that says they’re killing all the white people in South Africa,” Jimmy Kimmel explained on Wednesday night. “Trump apparently has seen this online, so he brings the president in, he turns the lights down and makes him sit through a multimedia presentation about his own country titled ‘White Genocide.’”</p><blockquote><p>“I mean, seriously, does anyone at the White House — does anyone around him ever say, ‘Oh, Mr. President, this one is wrong, this is not real, this one makes you look demented and dumb’? Nobody does.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JPnNEVZLp4M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On “The Daily Show,” Ronny Chieng said Trump had turned the White House meeting “into a murder podcast.”</p><blockquote><p>“Trump is convinced that there is white genocide going on in South Africa, which of course means there is no white genocide happening in South Africa. It’s not even mathematically possible. I mean, you’ll never run out of white South Africans when one of them is making 5,000 kids a week.” — <em>RONNY CHIENG, referring to Elon Musk</em></p><p>“But still, Trump thinks there is one, and you know he cares about it because he said ‘white genocide.’ It’s like someone told him, ‘Hey, it’s not just a genocide, it’s a <em>white</em> genocide. You know, the bad kind.’” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“During the meeting, this is real, things got pretty heated, and the president of South Africa actually said, ‘I’m sorry I don’t have a plane to give you.’ And then, to mess with Trump even more, he gave him tickets to see a Springsteen concert in New Jersey.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Trump asked some tough questions, like, ‘How did <em>you</em> get rid of Elon? I’ll tell you what I did. How did you do it?’ <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“If you really want to impress Trump, you should have given him one of your golf courses. Then Trump would be like, ‘Hell, yeah! Sorry, white South Africans, if that’s even a real thing. Thoughts and prayers.’” — <em>RONNY CHIENG</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-4c6ebd2d">The Punchiest Punchlines (Golden Dome Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“President Trump has unveiled plans for a ‘Golden Dome’ missile defense shield that could cost tens of billions. Here is a schematic of what the golden dome would look like. The best part about the defense shield? He says the Klingons will pay for it.” — <em>GREG GUTFELD</em></p><p>“We’re fine. Gold doesn’t melt. It’s the strongest metal on earth.” — <em>GRACE KUHLENSCHMIDT of “The Daily Show”</em></p><p>“Yes, gold. Because when I think impenetrable, I think of stuff that pirates can bend with their teeth.” — <em>STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“You know, it takes a special leader to look at what’s going on in Israel and be like, ‘Hey, we need to copy those guys, all right, because it’s going great.’ Second of all, I don’t think missile defense shields work like frequent flier programs, all right? ‘Hey, check it out, our dome just earned gold status! I hope China doesn’t get a platinum dome, then they get lounge access.’” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>On “Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney,” the host’s future self (played by Peter Gallagher) warned him against a stunt planned for next week’s finale, which will have disastrous consequences.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-1a7073d0">What We’re Excited About on Thursday Night</h2><p>Shaquille O’Neal will be a guest on “The Tonight Show,” giving him ample opportunity to explain an N.B.A. draft conspiracy theory.</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Mulaney wore a blindfold for an entire episode, which also featured, from left, Richard Kind, Jeremy Levick, Patton Oswalt, Sarah Silverman, Alanis Morissette and Steve Guttenberg.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Rose/Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div>
