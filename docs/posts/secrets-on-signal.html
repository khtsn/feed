    <h1>Secrets on Signal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Why does it seem so hard to keep government information classified? Donald Trump and Joe Biden both took top-secret documents to their houses. Hillary Clinton kept State Department emails on a personal server. This week, the White House added a journalist to a group chat about bombing Yemen.</p><p>The administration argues it wasn’t a big deal. But security experts say the Signal thread, in which The Atlantic’s editor was accidentally included, was a sloppy and dangerous mistake.</p><p>There are several reasons this sort of lapse keeps happening — and the Trump administration is uniquely prone. Today’s newsletter will break them down and explain the stakes.</p><h2 id="link-63ec1d47">Hard to use</h2><p>There are computer systems designed to discuss war plans and other secrets. They are accessible only in secured rooms, and it’s very difficult for foreign powers to penetrate them. You can’t bring your personal devices into these rooms, which are not connected to the web.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But all that security makes them cumbersome and annoying. In most secured rooms, you can’t toggle between work and social media, the way most of us do. You can’t scroll through a classified feed while watching “The White Lotus.” For all but the top officials, who have Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, or SCIFs, built at their homes, you have to go into the office to check on “the high side,” the slang for the secret computer networks.</p><p>Government officials, including new political appointees like the ones in the Signal chat, are trained on the proper protocols, and it can be a crime to violate them. But it’s hard to toggle between an economic speech in Michigan, which the vice president was giving on the day he weighed in, and the monkish habits needed to interact with restricted material. Biden administration officials sometimes used Signal, too, though more for directing colleagues to SCIFs for updates than for sharing the government secrets that could be found there.</p><h2 id="link-49a2703c">Trump’s style</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>National security officials before a Senate committee.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Those hassles are at odds with the pledge that Trump administration officials have made to simplify government work and remove red tape. Trump claims he has a mandate from voters who think the government doesn’t work. He has flayed the Biden and Obama White Houses for a deliberative process that made government work slowly.</p><p>So his administration has moved fast — often too fast, not always thinking through the consequences of its actions. In a quest to reduce the work force, the C.I.A. fired many of its employees working in diversity initiatives, never mind that many were talented recruiters of spies. In some cases, the administration has had to painfully undo decisions that went too far. It dismissed government scientists and regulators overseeing nuclear plants and then had to rehire them for safety reasons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That attitude is evident in the officials’ use of Signal, a commercial messaging app with lots of encryption — but not enough to satisfy the government’s high standards for secrecy. The app runs on personal phones, and those are vulnerable. Personal phones can be hacked by nation states and companies. Still, a SCIF is a form of red tape. Texting your colleagues to get work done is more efficient.</p><p>The emphasis on action may also have caused the original mistake. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, or someone using his phone, added the journalist. It was a user error. In another administration, someone might have double-checked, but not this time.</p><h2 id="link-7df2c56">Why it matters</h2><p>Russia has shared intelligence with the Houthis, the rebels and pirates targeted in the Yemen bombing. At a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/intelligence-officials-signal-leak.html" title="">House hearing yesterday</a>, one Democrat, Mike Quigley of Illinois, asked what would have happened if the Houthis had the details in the chat. (Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told the group on Saturday that F-18s would be arriving at 1:45 p.m., for instance.)</p><p>The Houthis have shot down American drones and fired at U.S. ships. They have coastal defense and anti-air missiles. Maybe if they’d foreseen the attack, they could have threatened the safety of American pilots. It is not something on which the government usually gambles.</p><p>At the hearing, America’s spy chiefs — the director of intelligence and the head of the C.I.A. — said no classified information had been shared. And it’s true that those two officials said little in the chat. But Hegseth shared enough for the Russians to know what was happening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It’s reasonable to believe that Trump officials have used Signal before and would have again if they hadn’t been caught. Based on their apologias this week, perhaps they still will. But the scandal puts a bull’s-eye on Signal. The Chinese already have access to U.S. mobile networks and have intercepted the calls of prominent Americans, including Vice President JD Vance. It would be relatively easy for them to gain access to the next round of chats.</p><p>So imagine a different scenario, the next one, in which the subject is not bombing Houthis but deploying American ships and planes to protect Taiwan. If China knew about U.S. plans, it could pre-empt, outflank or outsmart the Americans. It could jeopardize American lives. It could seize Taiwan before the United States had time to act.</p><p>Perhaps that prospect will eventually scare officials back into their SCIFs. It’s what they were built for.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>The Atlantic published the full exchange. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/25/us/signal-group-chat-text-annotations.html" title="">See the messages here</a>, annotated by Julian and other Times journalists.</p></li><li><p>In the days since the chat was revealed, the Trump administration has offered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/signal-chat-military-plan-leak-trump.html?smid=url-share" title="">shifting, sometimes contradictory</a> and often implausible explanations.</p></li><li><p>The White House’s defense <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/hegseth-signal-war-plan-leak-white-house.html" title="">relies heavily on semantics</a> — like “war plans” versus “battle plans” — to obscure the severity of its error, David Sanger writes.</p></li><li><p>Late-night hosts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/arts/television/late-night-signal-chat-group.html" title="">joked about the leak</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-54022da5">Tariffs</h2><ul><li><p>Trump said he would impose a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/26/business/trump-tariffs-auto-cars" title="">25 percent tariff on cars and auto parts</a> shipped into the U.S. Trump’s aim is to grow domestic manufacturing, but the fees could drive up consumer prices significantly.</p></li><li><p>Regulators will have to navigate a complex supply chain: Even cars made in America are built with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/04/business/economy/car-tariffs.html" title="">parts that come from all over the world</a>.</p></li><li><p>The tariffs could be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/trump-auto-tariffs-europe.html" title="">particularly tough on Germany</a>, which exports cars from Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-31f30dd7">Public Media Hearing</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Katherine Maher, chief of NPR; and Paula Kerger, chief of PBS.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>At a congressional hearing, Republicans accused the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/media/pbs-npr-congress-hearing-republicans.html?smid=url-share" title="">leaders of PBS and NPR</a> of using publicly funded media to push left-wing views.
