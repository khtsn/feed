    <h1>Ukraine Forces a Halt to Flow of Natural Gas From Russia to Europe</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Russian energy giant, Gazprom, issued a statement early<span>  </span>on Wednesday confirming that it was no longer sending gas from the Siberian plains through the pipeline.</p><p>Even before the move, which was widely anticipated, Europe had sharply reduced its consumption of Russian gas in response to<span>  </span>Moscowâ€™s invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. Volumes through the Ukrainian transit pipeline had fallen to around a quarter of their prewar levels.</p><p>Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and several Balkan countries still rely on Russian gas delivered through Ukraine, but experts say gas in storage facilities and alternative supplies should prevent any immediate disruptions to electricity and heating in these countries.</p><p>More vulnerable is Moldova. In December it declared a state of emergency amid fears that an end to supplies of Russian gas through Ukraine would endanger its main source of electricity, a gas-fueled power plant in the breakaway Russian-speaking region of Transnistria.</p><p>Gazprom warned Moldova this week that it would halt all gas deliveries on Jan. 1 even if the pipeline through Ukraine kept working, citing a long-running dispute over unpaid bills.</p></div></div>
