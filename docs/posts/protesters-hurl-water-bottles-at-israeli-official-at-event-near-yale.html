More than 300 protesters had assembled outside the Shabtai house over several hours, waving Israeli and Palestinian flags, <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2025/04/24/far-right-israeli-minister-ignites-protests-outside-of-shabtai/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the student newspaper</a>, the Yale Daily News.</p><p>Earlier, a large group of students briefly erected a tent encampment on the Yale campus plaza in protest of Mr. Ben-Gvir’s appearance.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Gvir <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/27/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-ben-gvir.html" title="">has long stood on the fringes of Israeli politics</a> and has been widely criticized for his extreme views. He was barred as a teenager from serving in the Israeli Army because he was seen as too extremist. For some time, he had a portrait in his home of a man who shot dead 29 Palestinians in a West Bank mosque in 1994.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The protests were reminiscent of the demonstrations against the war in Gaza that rocked Yale and other campuses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/pro-palestinian-college-protests-encampments.html" title="">across the nation last spring</a>. At Columbia University, where students in recent weeks have protested the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university.html" title="">federal detention of pro-Palestinian campus organizers</a>, the school’s public safety office said on Wednesday that it had also been “made aware of possible plans to establish encampments.”</p><p>Near Yale’s campus, some students were also struck by water bottles during the demonstration, the student newspaper reported. The New Haven police said that one man, who was not a student, had kicked cars as they drove by and had been arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and interfering with an officer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators block vehicles before Mr. Ben-Gvir’s appearance.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle McLoughlin/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The confrontation came on Mr. Ben-Gvir’s first official trip to the United States since he rejoined the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March.</p><p>The decision to invite the national security minister to the event sparked immediate backlash, including from some current and former Jewish students at Yale, who pointed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/world/middleeast/netanyahu-isreal-cabinet-government.html" title="">his criminal convictions</a> for incitement to racism and support for a terrorist group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>More than 40 Jewish alumni <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2025/04/23/letter-4-23/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a letter this week that Mr. Ben-Gvir’s “celebration of hatred and revenge” was inconsistent with their Jewish values. Twenty Jewish clergy members who graduated from Yale <a href="https://truah.org/press/an-open-letter-from-yale-alumni-jewish-clergy-urging-shabtai-society-to-disinvite-ben-gvir/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> him “a danger to all Israelis and Palestinians.”</p><p>Mr. Ben-Gvir’s office said in a statement to CNN that water bottles had been thrown at him but that he was not injured and was in “good health.”</p><p>“Minister Ben-Gvir refused to leave the scene and made a V sign at them, as a sign of victory,” his office said.</p><p>A spokesman for Yale did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did Rabbi Shmully Hecht, Shabtai’s co-founder and rabbinical director.</p><p>But Rabbi Hecht <a href="https://www.jta.org/2025/04/23/united-states/an-elite-jewish-society-at-yale-fractures-over-its-directors-embrace-of-itamar-ben-gvir" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency</a>, an international news and wire service, that he admired Mr. Ben-Gvir, who he said “promotes what he believes is best for his people that democratically elected him.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Troy Closson is a Times education reporter focusing on K-12 schools.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
