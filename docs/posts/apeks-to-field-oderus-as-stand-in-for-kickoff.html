		<p>this liquid roster can easily beat a team with oderus lmfao </p>

		<p>ummmm they r going to champs period, i give them 50/50 for an international title as well, flor is the goat and will aim diff aspas if she plays against him mark my words and im bookmarking this and coming back here ALSO, oderus has experience with MxS making him bad but better than  any old coach</p>

</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4427549">
		
		
		<p>Flor should prove she&#39;s the goat in VCT first before we jump to conclusions. Even if she&#39;s stomping in EMEA, I doubt the team around her can compete with top teams. </p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4427569">
		
		
		<p>Flor has a better ACS in game changers champs than she does in NA ranked. Yeah she looks insane in GC but that doesn&#39;t at all compare to VCT. GC is like half low radiant to immortal 3 players whereas VCT, especially international tournaments, is literally the best players worldwide. Flor will be good just judging from ranked stats alone, but acting like she can hard carry some bums to a trophy is just delusion. </p>

			<p>dw bro people see visa issues and instantly think hes something </p>
<p>in reality bro averaged 1.0 rating in t2 and hes a kid with potential, nothing that will tip the scales in favor of apeks who already are way worse </p>		</div>

		<p>For those of you who did not watch na tier 2, as mxs fan, i tried to be as accommodating as i could with oderus when he played but he is only good as a coach and simply isnt suited to be a player.</p>
