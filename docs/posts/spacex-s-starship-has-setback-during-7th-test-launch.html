But data indicated that some of the engines on the upper stage shut down prematurely, and about 8.5 minutes after launch, communications between the ground and the upper-stage vehicle, which is known as Starship, were cut off.</p><p>Starship is the rocket that Elon Musk, the company’s founder, says will take people to Mars some day. NASA is also paying SpaceX to develop a version of the vehicle to return American astronauts to the moon.</p><p>Over the first six test flights, SpaceX has demonstrated that it can launch the largest rocket ever into space and more or less bring the pieces back to Earth intact. Over the coming year, the company is looking to turn “more or less” into “reliably” and prove out other capabilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Liftoff occurred at 5:37 p.m. Eastern time from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/us/starbase-texas-city-elon-musk-spacex.html" title="">Starbase, SpaceX’s launch site</a> in south Texas.</p><p>After finishing its work pushing the rocket through the thickest part of the atmosphere, the booster dropped away and headed back toward the launchpad. It was then successfully caught by two mechanical arms on the launch tower.</p><p>Shortly after that, the trouble with the upper-stage spacecraft occurred.</p><p>“That is telling us we had an anomaly with the upper stage,” said Dan Huot, one of the hosts of SpaceX’s video stream. “We are assuming the vehicle was lost.”</p><p>The upper-stage spacecraft was to splash down in the Indian Ocean about one hour after launch.</p><h2 id="link-6284f793">What is Starship?</h2><p>The Starship rocket system is the largest ever built — 403 feet tall, or nearly 100 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty including the pedestal.</p><p>And it has the most engines ever in a rocket booster: The Super Heavy booster — the bottom part of the rocket — has 33 of SpaceX’s powerful Raptor engines sticking out of its bottom. As those engines lift Starship off the launchpad in South Texas, they will generate 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle.</p><p>The upper part, also called Starship or Ship for short, looks like a shiny rocket from a science fiction movie from the 1950s and is made of stainless steel with large fins. This is the upper stage that will head toward orbit, and ultimately could carry people to the moon or even Mars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-446384ba">What happened during the last flight?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/science/spacex-launch-starship.html" title="">President-elect Donald J. Trump attended</a> the sixth test flight on Nov. 19, visiting Mr. Musk in the launch control room. The upper Starship flew on a suborbital trajectory halfway around the world, successfully re-entered the atmosphere and performed a landing maneuver, flipping to a vertical position before gently splashing down in the Indian Ocean about an hour after liftoff.</p><p>Not unexpectedly, it then tipped over and exploded.</p><p>The booster also successfully re-entered the atmosphere. But plans to catch it using — a feat that SpaceX accomplished during the fifth test flight — were called off after sensors on the mechanical arms were damaged during launch. The booster was diverted to the Gulf of Mexico.</p><h2 id="link-7752844c">What’s different about the seventh flight?</h2><p>For the Starship on this seventh test flight, significant design changes were made to the propulsion, the heat shield and the control systems. The rocket had been stretched several feet taller than earlier Starships — space for bigger tanks that hold 25 percent more propellant. The flaps near the top of Starship were smaller and had been moved toward the tip to reduce damage from the searing temperatures of re-entry.</p><p>While in space, Starship was to test a new system that somewhat resembles a PEZ candy dispenser. It would have shot out 10 dummy satellites that were similar in size and shape to the next-generation spacecraft to be deployed for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/28/business/starlink.html" title="">SpaceX’s Starlink internet service</a>. The dummy satellites would have followed Starship’s trajectory and burn up in the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.</p><h2 id="link-67c7cab5">When will Starship be able to send people to space?</h2><p>The apparent failure on Thursday will push back SpaceX’s ambitiously speedy development schedule.</p><p>Even before the failure, it could have been at least a couple of years away from being ready for crewed missions. NASA is planning to use a version of Starship to take astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon during its Artemis III mission, currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/science/nasa-moon-artemis-delayed-2027.html" title="">scheduled for 2027</a>.</p><p>Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of the Shift4, a payment services company who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/science/spacex-polaris-dawn-astronauts-spacewalk.html" title="">flown twice to space on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets</a>, was to take part on the first crewed flight of Starship. But now that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/science/jared-isaacman-trump-nasa.html" title="">he has been selected by Mr. Trump to be the next administrator of NASA</a>, Mr. Isaacman is likely to stay on the ground, at least for now.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
