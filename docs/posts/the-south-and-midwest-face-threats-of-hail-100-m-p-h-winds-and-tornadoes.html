Winds high in the atmosphere are pulling warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico northward, where it will collide with colder air to the north. “That’s going to cause heavy rain and a severe outbreak across the South,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-6a871e31">The storms could move quickly.</h2><p>The initial severe storms are likely to happen Friday afternoon and Friday night, especially across parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Illinois, Mississippi and Alabama.</p><p>Forecasters in St. Louis said a dangerous severe weather outbreak is possible, and that these storms will likely move very fast — sometimes reaching the speeds of cars on the interstate highways — potentially catching people off guard and leaving long trails of damage.</p><p>They also said the center of the storm system is likely to undergo rapid cyclogenesis, making it a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/climate/bomb-cyclone.html" title="">bomb cyclone</a>” because its central pressure is expected to drop rapidly in 24 hours, creating a more volatile system.</p><p>Although the core strength of the storm will remain well to the north, its influence will be felt in the Southern states.</p><p>“Some of the severe thunderstorms are going to be displaced from the center of the storm,” said Bob Oravec, the lead forecaster at the Weather Prediction Center. These storms will develop along the cold front as it moves eastward, creating a line of severe weather stretching across large portions of the South and Midwest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-51e2dc76">Tornadoes are possible in the Mississippi Valley.</h2><p>Areas of Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee were the most likely to see tornadoes on Friday and were likely to be the first to see winds kick up Friday morning, contributing to an elevated fire danger.
