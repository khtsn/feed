As the system moved east, it brought the threat of blizzard conditions and powerful winds to the Great Plains and Upper Midwest.</p><p>At the same time, the storm’s trailing cold front swept across the central United States, creating dry and gusty conditions that fueled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/weather/fire-dry-texas-new-mexico.html" title="">critical fire weather</a> across parts of New Mexico and Texas. By Thursday and Friday, that fire risk had expanded across much of the central and southern High Plains.</p><p>The severe weather threat began affecting parts of the South late Wednesday, when the Storm Prediction Center warned of thunderstorms producing hail and severe gusts across parts of the South, in an area stretching from northwest Texas and the Midwest across to northern Florida, through Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-6"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-03-13-snow" data-id="100000010048998" data-source-id="100000010048998"><div slug="2025-03-13-snow" data-sourceid="100000010048998" id="embed-id-100000010048998">

These storms will develop along the cold front as it moves eastward, creating a line of severe weather stretching across large portions of the South and Midwest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Heavy rain is also a growing concern, especially across parts of the lower- to mid-Mississippi Valley into parts of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, where the Weather Prediction Center has noted a marginal risk for excessive rainfall from Friday through Saturday.</p><p>The threat of severe weather is expected to continue into the weekend, as the front pushes eastward.</p><p>“There is a slight chance of severe weather anywhere from North Florida all the way up along the East Coast to the Washington D.C., area, Philadelphia and just outside New York City,” Mr. Oravec said. “It’s not going to be as great a risk as areas farther to the west.”</p><p>On Saturday, the Storm Prediction Center highlights parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama as areas facing the greatest severe weather risk, including damaging gusts, hail and “significant tornadoes.”</p><p>The storm is expected to move offshore on Monday.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
