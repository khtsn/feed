The county sheriff said earlier this week that schools there had been told of an investigation last year into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/georgia-shooting-suspect-fbi-interview-threat.html" title="">whether the boy had made online threats</a>, but school officials said Friday that they were never informed.</p><p>The discrepancy added to questions building in the community about whether anything could have been done to prevent the shooting that killed Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and two math teachers, Richard Aspinwall and Cristina Irimie. Nine other people were hospitalized with injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The teenager’s hearing Friday morning in the courtroom in Winder, Ga., lasted less than 10 minutes. The boy, whose face was not visible to cameras because of rules involving minors, briefly answered procedural questions from Judge Currie M. Mingledorff II before he was escorted out. He was shackled and wore a green T-shirt with khaki pants and boots.</p><p>Not long after, the judge brought the teenager back into the courtroom to tell him that because he was a minor, he would not face the death penalty.</p><p>Colin Gray was arrested Thursday and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/us/georgia-school-shooting-colt-gray-father.html" title="">charged with second-degree murder</a> and other crimes in connection with the attack. Judge Mingledorff told Mr. Gray that the maximum penalty for the charges against him, which include involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children, would add up to 180 years in prison.</p><p>It’s rare for parents of shooting suspects to be charged with crimes, but prosecutors have shown a growing willingness to try to hold them responsible in high-profile cases. This year, the parents of a teenage school shooter in Michigan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/16/us/crumbley-michigan-oxford-school-shooting.html" title="">were convicted of manslaughter</a>. The couple, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were the first parents in the country to be directly charged for the deaths caused by their child in a mass shooting.</p><p>In Georgia on Wednesday, the school went into lockdown at the sound of gunshots. The locked classroom doors, as well as a newly installed alarm system, may have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/us/georgia-shooting-apalachee-security-lockdown-badges.html" title="">helped to prevent further bloodshed</a>, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some students said that they had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/georgia-school-shooting-witnesses.html" title="">huddled quietly in their classrooms</a> for more than an hour, and many left their phones behind when they eventually evacuated to the school’s football field, making it hard for them to connect with anxious family members. Traffic snarled around the school as parents scrambled to find their children.</p><p>The suspect surrendered to school resource officers and was taken into custody, law enforcement officials said. The police have found evidence that he was interested in mass shootings, particularly the 2018 massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Colin Gray, 54, is accused of allowing his son access to the military-style rifle that was used in the mass shooting.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Brynn Anderson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Relatives suggested that he had a troubled home life. Charlie Polhamus, the teenager’s maternal grandfather, said he believed his grandson was responsible for what happened but also cast some of the blame on the tumult in the teenager’s life with his father, who had split from his wife.</p><p>“My grandson did what he did because of the environment that he lived in,” Mr. Polhamus said.</p><p>In May of last year, when the boy and his father lived in Jackson County, F.B.I. officials were alerted to some disturbing messages on Discord, a social media platform: Someone in a chat group had threatened to possibly “shoot up a middle school.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/05/us/georgia-school-shooting#georgia-school-shooting-suspect-threat" title="">report from the Jackson County sheriff’s office</a>, obtained by The New York Times, said that an email associated with the Discord user who had made the threat belonged to Colt Gray, then 13, who denied that he had made the post.</p><p>At the time, Colin Gray told an investigator that he and his wife were no longer together and that they had been evicted from their home, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/05/us/georgia-school-shooting" title="">according to a transcript of a May 2023 interview</a> obtained by The Times. Records from the 2022 eviction show that Mr. Gray owned a black AR-15, as well as several other guns.</p><p>The father told investigators in 2023 that his son did not have “unfettered” access to firearms, and they were not able to definitively link the boy to the threat. Nevertheless, officials “alerted local schools for continued monitoring of the subject,” Sheriff Janis Mangum of Jackson County said in a social media post on Wednesday.</p><p>But on Friday, Donna McMullan, the superintendent of the Jefferson City School District in Jackson County, wrote an email to parents saying that school officials were not aware of the threats and have “no record of an investigation.” The suspect attended middle school in the district during the 2022-2023 school year, Dr. McMullan said.</p><p>Sheriff Mangum told The Times in an interview that an employee who no longer works for the department communicated with the F.B.I. about the investigation and provided The Times with a copy of his email to the agency, which said, “We have made area schools aware and will monitor the subject.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I can’t prove whether he contacted them or not,” she said. “All I have is the email.” The former employee could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>The sheriff said she told Dr. McMullan to put out the statement to parents if the superintendent did not recall being informed. “I don’t want the school bashed for not passing on the information to Barrow County schools, when the schools here might not have got notified,” Sheriff Mangum said.</p><p>Aftershocks of the attack continued to be felt beyond the small community of Winder. On Friday, officials with the Atlanta Public Schools sent a text message to parents about “an uptick in social media threats directed toward some of our schools,” though they said that the threats so far were believed to be hoaxes.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Glenn Thrush<!-- --> in Washington, <!-- -->Sean Keenan<!-- --> in Jackson County, Ga., and <!-- -->Richard Fausset<!-- --> in Atlanta.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rick Rojas is the Atlanta bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the South.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rick-rojas">More about Rick Rojas</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jacey Fortin covers a wide range of subjects for the National desk of The Times, including extreme weather, court cases and state politics all across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jacey-fortin">More about Jacey Fortin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>16</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Teenage Suspect and His Father, Each Facing Charges, Appear in Court<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/06/us/georgia-school-shooting.html">1775</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/06/us/georgia-school-shooting.html">1775</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
