    <h1>Is the Restaurant Good? Or Is It Just the Ambience?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>How many shades of pink and orange can you fit into a single restaurant? At <a href="https://www.papasannyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Papa San</a> in Midtown Manhattan, the limit may not exist.</p><p>A neon-orange sign bearing the Peruvian Japanese restaurant’s name — in chubby capital letters inspired by Japanese typography — flashes above the bar like a homing beacon over Hudson Yards. Customers sip pisco sours on branded pink coasters and visit a bathroom saturated in orange light. Employees wear burnt orange hats, descend a pink staircase and print checks over an orange table. Even an alcohol warning sign behind the bar includes the Papa San font and the word “warning” in a popping rosy hue.</p><p>The design is so pervasive and striking that you might forget this sunset-shaded expanse also serves food. Erik Ramirez, the chef and an owner of Papa San, is well aware of this.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-1"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Everything at Papa San is branded, including the cooks’ hats and T-shirts.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lanna Apisukh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Papa San also carries branded merchandise, including lighters and matchbooks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lanna Apisukh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Everything is branding nowadays,” said Mr. Ramirez, who owns two other Peruvian restaurants in New York City. For diners, “I feel like the food element is kind of an after thought.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A decade ago, the country’s most buzzed-about restaurants were largely defined by the ambition of the food and the credentials of the chef. Now, they’re all about atmosphere and appearance. For many diners who grew up in the visuals-obsessed Instagram era, a restaurant doesn’t need to have a particular aesthetic — it just needs to have a memorable one.</p><p>What might that look like? “Fun, stylish, and full of energy, with great drinks, good enough food and an atmosphere they can’t replicate at home,” said Anna Polonsky, the founder of the Brooklyn design studio <a href="https://www.polonskyandfriends.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polonsky and Friends</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp/08FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp/08FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp/08FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A pink spiral staircase at the Papa San restaurant." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp/08FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp/08FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp/08FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp/08FD-restaurant-packaging7-gzjp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/2da7c3c9-ab0f-5d23-9820-2f5ac268bbf5" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A pink spiral staircase at Papa San leads to the restaurant’s dining room.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lanna Apisukh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Sarah Hoski, who runs an Asheville dining <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eatasheville/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram account</a>, said her followers are more interested in the holistic experience of a restaurant than just the food. “Very rarely do I now get the question of: What recommendations do you have because of the food?” she said. “It is more: What recommendations do you have because of the space or the vibe?”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Wholesale branding was once the domain of large restaurant groups with six- to seven-figure design budgets. Now, any restaurant can create a logo and custom merchandise thanks to online tools like <a href="https://www.canva.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canva</a>, said Jeff Chanchaleune, the chef and owner of the Lao noodle shop <a href="https://www.barsenokc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bar Sen</a> in Oklahoma City. He spent just $12,000 on branding for Bar Sen — about 5 percent of his total budget — and started selling hats and T-shirts before he had even finalized the restaurant’s menu.</p><p>“The way the space makes them feel,” he said, referring to customers, “might just make the food taste better.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jeff Chanchaleune, the owner of Bar Sen (pictured above), said a nice-looking dining room might make the food taste better to guests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brett Deering for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The cost of dining out is also steadily rising, said Hillary Dixler Canavan, the former restaurant editor of Eater. Customers want more than a meal when they’re at a restaurant — they want the theatrics. “Once you are spending a lot of money,” she said, you “expect the experience to rise with the bill.”</p><p>And as restaurants go ambitious with interior design and branding, many of them are betting that today’s customers prefer well-worn dishes with mass appeal. “They are serving basically what everyone else is serving: It is a steakhouse, it is a red sauce joint, it is a pizzeria,” Ms. Dixler Canavan said. “But look at the cool branding. The identity is wrapped up in what it looks like rather than what it is actually doing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p><a href="https://sharpiespizza.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sharpies</a> may be one of hundreds of pizzerias in Chicago. But it’s the only one with a flying saucer in the dining room, twinkling constellations on the ceiling and a three-eyed alien dog mascot.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Bar Sen logo is even stamped on chopsticks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brett Deering for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Scott Koehl, an owner, said he felt free to experiment with design because he was serving something as widely available as pizza. His strategy worked: Sharpies has had strong, consistent business since opening in March, Mr. Koehl said. It has also gotten far more attention on social media than his other Chicago restaurant, <a href="https://www.adastreetchicago.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ada Street</a>, which has no eye-catching logo, striking color palette or kitschy mascot. “I don’t think that restaurant could survive if it opened this year,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Koehl is already thinking about the custom apparel he will roll out — T-shirts, hats — in coming months. Before the pandemic, restaurants might ask her to create custom menus and coasters, said Ms. Polonsky, the designer. Now, she puts a limit to the amount of merchandise she will design. “Right after Covid everyone was asking us for baseball caps and sweatshirts, and I thought that was super wasteful,” she said. “How many baseball caps do people need?”</p><p>Restaurateurs don’t just want a dining room that looks nice — it has to be personal, too, she said, with details like customized wallpaper and first aid posters. Not long ago, many restaurants gravitated toward similar design approaches, like midcentury modernism, or neutral-hued minimalism, Ms. Polonsky said. “Now, in both branding and interiors, there is more and more a desire to create your own story,” she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Despite serving a dish as familiar as pizza, Sharpies stands out for its intergalactic-themed interior design.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mary Mathis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>As a young cook, Sam Yoo, who owns the New York restaurants <a href="https://www.goldenhof.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Hof</a>, <a href="https://www.nykimchi48.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NY Kimchi</a> and <a href="https://www.goldendinerny.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Diner</a>, believed that excellent food was the decisive factor in attracting customers.</p><p>“But once I flipped over as a business owner, I was like, ‘Oh, you know what? Food is only 40 to 50 percent,’” he said. “The rest of it is vibe and service.”</p><p>For Golden Hof and NY Kimchi, which both opened in Midtown in February, Mr. Yoo spent $200,000 total on atmospheric details, hiring a lighting designer, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/dining/restaurant-playlist.html" title="">music curator</a> and an illustrator who designed art for the menus. “We are competing against the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/dining/carbone-las-vegas-new-york-miami-dallas.html" title="">Major Food Groups</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/14/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html" title="">Bad Romans</a>,” he said.</p><p>Now, he has a new philosophy for success in the restaurant business. “Food, service and design are the holy trinity,” he said. “You need to have two out of three. You don’t need to have all three.”</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Priya Krishna is a reporter in the Food section of The Times.</p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/09/dining/restaurant-ambience-vibes.html">63</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Revolving Restaurant</strong>: Long considered a midcentury novelty, rotating restaurants are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/dining/revolving-restaurant.html">spinning back to life in cities across the United States</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Story of the Stroopwafel:</strong> Once considered “poor man cookies,” these Dutch sweets have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/dining/stroopwafel-cookie.html">found a global audience of loyal fans</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why Is Dining Alone So Difficult?</strong>: With solo reservations on the rise but many restaurants still restricting tables to two or more, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/dining/solo-dining-restaurants.html">solitary Americans often feel left out</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Eating in New York City</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Inspired Mexican American Food at a Queens Bar</strong>: Like the big cat that presides over this Ridgewood restaurant, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/dining/hellbender-nyc-restaurant-review.html">Hellbender knows how to stretch</a> — mixing late-night vibes with polished cooking.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Irish Pub Draws a Martini Crowd</strong>: T.J.
