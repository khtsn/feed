<p>Starting on Split, both teams ran a mirror composition of double-Duelist with Waylay and Raze. Yet, despite similar compositions, one duelist stood out. After winning the pistol, AG fought to earn an 8-2 lead thanks to the Waylay play from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/21216/f4ngeer">
		f4ngeer	</a>
</span>. Nova did threaten a close map after winning the final two rounds in the first half and converting an eco after losing its second pistol round, down 9-5. </p>

<p>However, All Gamers won an eco of its own to reach an 11-5 lead and eventually convert the map 13-7, taking the lead in the series.</p>

<p>Next up was Pearl, which was a banger of an overtime thriller. AG ran double-Duelist again, this time with f4ngeer moving to Yoru, while Nova opted for double-Initiator. Nova started hot by winning the first pistol and converting the bonus, but AG fought back on a run of its own soon after. Despite going down 4-0, AG entered the half up 7-5. This was the turning point for Nova, as the team once again started the half strong to tie the game at 8-8. Then, chaos ensued, highlighted by this unbelievable play from f4ngeer with fate on his side.</p>

<p><em>f4ngeer gets detained in a corner but still clutches against Nova.</em></p>

<p>Despite the backbreaking round loss, Nova still took the map to overtime thanks to some great plays from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/34181/green">
		GREEN	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/41054/guang">
		GuanG	</a>
</span>, but two rounds in OT secured the map 16-14 for AG to complete the 2-0 victory.</p>

<p>The star of the series was f4ngeer, who made his debut in VCT China count. In the sweep, he ended with 55 kills and 270 ACS.</p>

<p>With this win, All Gamers will face off against Bilibili Gaming in the upper bracket.</p>



<p>The series began on Corrode, with JDG running a double-Duelist with Waylay while TEC ran double-Controller and double-Initiator with solo Waylay. TEC earned the first pistol, but lost the antieco. JDG took advantage to jump to a 7-2 lead, but TEC won the final three rounds of the first half to reach halftime only down 7-5.</p>

<p>Where the first half was close, the second half was all JDG. After winning the second pistol and converting the bonus, the rest of the map was quick as JDG won Corrode 13-6 and took the series lead.</p>

<p>Next up was Haven, as JDG ran an off-meta comp for the map while TEC stuck to the standard Neon and double-Controller. Despite losing the pistol to start the map, that choice to stick to the common comp for Haven worked well for TEC, reaching a 7-5 lead at the half. Both <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/5011/abo">
		Abo	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/42235/dynamite">
		Dynamite	</a>
</span> were hitting key shots, as TEC flipped the script from map one to do the exact same thing to JDG to win Haven 13-6 and tie the series.</p>

<p>On Abyss, the deciding map, both teams ran slight variations of a double-Duelist with Waylay and Yoru. TEC won the first pistol, but was followed by JDG preventing the bonus round conversion and taking the lead early on Abyss. <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/47629/coco">
		Coco	</a>
</span> had some great rounds for TEC, but JDG were clean on retakes to enter the half up 8-4.</p>

<p>An aggressive defense pistol play from TEC failed, giving JDG the second pistol win on Abyss and putting the team in an ideal position to end the map and series. Up 10-4, it was a god-tier spray transfer from Coco that stopped the bonus round win.</p>


<p><em>Coco gets four quickly to end the bonus round hopes of JDG.</em></p>

<p>When both teams started to take teamfights more often, TEC built confidence, quickly turning a 10-4 deficit into only 10-7. JDG had to try to close out the map to prevent a big comeback, and finally did with some clean post-plant scenarios and some nice Operator shots from <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/49476/zhe">
		zhe	</a>
</span>. After reaching map point, TEC did show a lot of fight to reach double digits, but it was too late. JDG won Abyss 13-10 and the series 2-1, sending TEC down to the middle bracket of Kickoff.</p>

<p>The star player in this three-map series was <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/16924/stew">
		stew	</a>
</span>, who played well on Corrode but stood out on Abyss to close out the win for his squad. He ended the series with 47 kills and 219 ACS, which led all players across both teams.</p>

<p>With this win, JDG will move on in the upper bracket to face off against <span data-ref-id="12">
