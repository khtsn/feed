It also means the central bank may be more open to commercial banks holding smaller reserves while extending more and larger loans.</p><p>The Politburo also called for a more proactive fiscal policy, which means that the government will be more willing to increase its own spending. It further suggested that the government would “strengthen extraordinary countercyclical measures,” an indication that the authorities may plan further steps to halt the erosion in economic growth rates.</p><p>The Politburo said that it was approving several measures at the same time in order to deliver a policy “combination punch” to address China’s economic challenges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Taken together, the steps announced on Monday amounted to a rare public acknowledgment that Beijing needed to a take a stronger hand in addressing the country’s economic weakness.</p><p>The Politburo’s announcements came ahead of the annual Central Economic Work Conference on Wednesday and Thursday, when the Chinese Communist Party and the cabinet set the country’s economic agenda for the upcoming year.</p><p>The conference is expected to reaffirm the Politburo’s stance and possibly also call for modest increases in government spending, particularly to help the elderly and very poor. But few economists expect the authorities to expand the budget deficit by enacting a very large increase in government aid to consumers. China has put more emphasis instead lately on helping manufacturers to build more high-tech factories.</p><p>The Politburo issued its statement after stock markets had closed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with prices little changed, but while trading was still underway in Hong Kong. Shares there jumped after the announcement: The Hang Seng Index finished up 2.8 percent, its best day in weeks.</p><p>Monday’s statement did not provide many details, including any specific sums of money to be spent or by how much interest rates may change. Even after the economic conference concludes, officials may not enact some large, highly specific policies until the national legislature gathers on March 5 for its annual, roughly weeklong session.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The last change in overall monetary policy was on Dec. 3, 2010, with a shift to a “prudent” stance. It was widely seen as a statement that the Chinese economy had rebounded strongly from the global financial crisis.</p><p>Many economists inside and outside of China are skeptical that looser monetary policy will turn around the economy. The main problem lies in weak consumer spending: The middle class has lost much of its savings in a real estate crash over the last three years, and many people have become reluctant to spend on things like new cars and restaurant meals.</p><p>While the gains in Hong Kong share trading suggested that the Politburo’s action may strengthen mainland markets, the economic benefits may be muted. Chinese households have less than 2 percent of their assets in stocks, versus around 70 percent in real estate.</p><p>A looser monetary policy may also give a small lift to the bond market, because bond prices rise when interest rates fall. But Chinese households don’t hold many bonds, either — it is mainly banks that hold bonds in China.</p><p>And even if banks have more money to lend at slightly lower interest rates, there’s just not much demand by businesses or consumers to borrow money at all.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Politburo’s statement came hours after the government disclosed that consumer prices in November were up 0.2 percent from a year earlier, a smaller increase than analysts expected.</p><p>Producer prices — the wholesale prices charged by factories, mines, farms and other enterprises — were down 2.5 percent last month from a year earlier. Broadly falling prices, a phenomenon known as deflation, can be crippling for an economy, as companies and households find it hard to make fixed interest payments on bank loans and bonds.</p><p>Li You<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Keith Bradsher is the Beijing bureau chief for The Times.
