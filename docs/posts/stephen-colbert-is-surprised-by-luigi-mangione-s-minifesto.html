Reminds me of what Manson said after his murders: ‘Whoops, my bad!’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“It’s so crazy to think that Donald Trump working the French fry machine was only the second-weirdest thing to happen at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania this year.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Police in Altoona report that they’ve been getting threats from Mangione’s fans, demanding he be released immediately. You know, I’ve been on TV just about nonstop for 29 years. This guy’s been in the news since Monday. He has fans threatening the police? Why do I feel like if I shot somebody, even my mother would be like, ‘Lock him up, teach him a lesson! It’s the only way he’s going to learn!’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“OK, ‘I don’t really know what I’m talking about’ is a surprising thing to put in a manifesto. This is the first murder manifesto I’ve read that could have ended with ‘But no worries if not!’” <em>— MICHAEL KOSTA</em></p><p>“You never see the Taliban like, ‘Death to America, although we’re not experts, so, grain of salt.’” <em>— MICHAEL KOSTA</em></p><p>“Mangione has now been charged with second-degree murder, but he’s not pleading guilty, and he’s fighting attempts to extradite him to New York. Well, that makes sense — no one wants to be extradited to New York during the holidays. You’ve got to wait in a two-hour line just to be cavity searched at the M&amp;M store.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-84fae9d">The Punchiest Punchlines (Two More Weeks Until Christmas Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Can you believe it? We’re only officially two weeks away from Christmas. Today, every Amazon driver looked at their family and said, ‘Well, see you in 2025.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Yep, just two weeks to go. We’re close to the point where you stop thinking, ‘What’s the best gift?’ and start thinking, ‘What’ll show up in time?’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“I believe murder is wrong. Turns out that’s an unpopular opinion, because suddenly, Luigi Mangione merch is everywhere, including T-shirts, hoodies and stickers and even a ‘Free Luigi’ doggy bandanna. Y’all, knock it off. Don’t make your dog wear murderer stuff. It’s Christmas — make him wear the plush reindeer antlers that he hates.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“There are a ton of family Christmas movies. There are hardly any for Hanukkah. Basically there is one Adam Sandler movie from 2002, ‘Eight Crazy Nights.’ And that’s it.
