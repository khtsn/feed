    <h1>Native American Activist Leonard Peltier Released From Prison</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Leonard Peltier, a Native American rights activist held for nearly half a century for the killing of two F.B.I. agents, was released from a federal prison in Central Florida on Tuesday morning.</p><p>Mr. Peltier, 80, will serve the remainder of his two life sentences in home confinement in North Dakota, where he is a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.</p><p>The commutation of Mr. Peltier’s sentence was one of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s final acts before leaving office. Those urging clemency for Mr. Peltier, who is in poor health and partially blind, included Nobel Peace laureates, former law enforcement officials including one of the lead prosecutors on the case, human rights organizations and celebrities like Steven Van Zandt, the guitarist for Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band.</p><p>F.B.I. agents including Christopher Wray, the former director of the agency, strongly opposed clemency for Mr. Peltier, saying that it was a betrayal of the fallen agents, Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. Mr. Wray called Mr. Peltier “a remorseless killer.”</p></div></div>
