Biden Jr.’s final acts before leaving office. Those urging clemency for Mr. Peltier, who is in poor health and partially blind, included Nobel Peace laureates, former law enforcement officials including one of the lead prosecutors on the case, human rights organizations and celebrities like Steven Van Zandt, the guitarist for Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band.</p><p>F.B.I. agents including Christopher Wray, the former director of the agency, strongly opposed clemency for Mr. Peltier, saying that it was a betrayal of the fallen agents, Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. Mr. Wray called Mr. Peltier “a remorseless killer.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He was convicted for his role in a shootout between activists and F.B.I. agents on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1975 that left two agents and an activist dead. Prosecutors said the agents were shot at point-blank range.</p><p>Mr. Peltier has admitted to firing his gun from a distance, but insisted that he acted in self-defense and did not kill the agents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Peltier after his release from federal prison. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Angel White Eyes/Ndn Collective, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Of the more than 30 people who were present during the shootout, Mr. Peltier was the only one to be convicted of a crime. Two other Native American activists were tried for murder, but were acquitted. Exculpatory evidence admitted in their trials, including ballistic evidence, was excluded from Mr. Peltier’s, which his supporters argue was one of the ways his trial was unfair.</p><p>An appeals court found in 1986 that the government had deliberately withheld evidence, but said that evidence would most likely not have changed the verdict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Peltier was set to undergo a medical examination on Tuesday before traveling to North Dakota.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shaila Dewan covers criminal justice — policing, courts and prisons — across the country.
