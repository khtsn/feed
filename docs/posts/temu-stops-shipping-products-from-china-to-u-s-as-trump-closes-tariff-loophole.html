    <h1>Temu Stops Shipping Products From China to U.S. as Trump Closes Tariff Loophole</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has stopped shipping products from China into the United States, a spokesperson for the company said on Friday. Instead, all of its U.S. orders will be shipped from local warehouses in America.</p><p>The change comes as the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/economy/trump-china-tariffs-de-minimis.html" title="">closed a loophole</a> that allowed products made in China and worth no more than $800 to enter the United States without import fees. The exemption, which President Trump has called a “big scam” that hurt American small businesses, ended Friday.</p><p>Temu said last month that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/tariffs-china-shein-temu.html" title="">adjust its prices</a> after Mr. Trump announced his intention to close the loophole, known as the de minimis exemption. Last week, the company started tacking on import charges for U.S. customers who wanted to buy items from China. In some cases, that more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/trump-tariffs-shein-temu-de-minimis.html" title="">doubled the price</a> of their purchases.</p><p>In the past few days, some shoppers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/companies-tariffs-price-increases.html" title="">noticed</a> that many products from China were removed from Temu’s site, leaving only items that were shipped from local warehouses.</p></div></div>
