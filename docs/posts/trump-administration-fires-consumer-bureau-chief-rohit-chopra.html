    <h1>Trump Administration Fires Consumer Bureau Chief Rohit Chopra</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Chopra was a scourge of Wall Street, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/business/rohit-chopra-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-wallstreet.html" title="">known for his aggressive approach</a> to enforcing consumer protection laws and expanding their boundaries by issuing new rules. He led a crackdown that prompted most large banks to abandon or significantly reduce overdraft fees, and he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/business/wells-fargo-consumer-loans-fine.html" title="">ordered Wells Fargo to pay $2 billion</a> in 2022 to customers harmed by its misdeeds, which included improperly seizing some borrowers’ cars and homes.</p><p>Mr. Chopra was especially focused on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/us/politics/cfpb-republicans-rohit-chopra.html" title="">tightening the rules</a> governing large technology companies’ consumer payment services and use of customer data, an effort that drew praise from banking trade groups. But those groups fiercely opposed many of his other actions, often tying them up in years of litigation.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/briefing/biden-junk-fees.html" title="">a Biden administration crusade against “junk fees,”</a> Mr. Chopra issued a rule last year to limit most credit card late-payment fees to no more than $8 per month. Banking trade groups sued and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/credit-card-fee-limit-blocked.html" title="">won an injunction</a> temporarily blocking it. The consumer bureau has fought the lawsuit, but a new director could choose to end that opposition and curtail or abandon the rule.</p><p>During President Trump’s first term, he installed an acting bureau director — Mick Mulvaney, who later served as his acting chief of staff — who sought to cut off the agency’s funding and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/magazine/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-trump.html" title="">cripple its enforcement efforts</a>. He was succeeded by Kathleen Kraninger, who issued rules that gutted Obama-era regulations, including one that would have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/payday-loans-rules-cfpb.html" title="">sharply curtailed payday lending</a>. Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. <a href="https://x.com/CFPBKraninger/status/1351949184883163138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ousted Ms. Kraninger</a> immediately upon taking office.</p><p>The bureau will be run by Zixta Martinez, its deputy director, until Mr. Trump chooses a new acting leader. Financial industry officials expect the agency to pare back its oversight, issue fewer new regulations and freeze or rescind some of those imposed by Mr. Chopra.</p></div></div>
