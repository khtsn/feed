    <h1>Penn Station’s Not-So-Secret Other Life: The People’s Dance Studio</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>As the train to Ronkonkoma pulled into Penn Station, Jason Lockhorn threw his arms up, bending his elbows like goal posts. But he wasn’t a frustrated commuter. He was dancing.</p><p>And he wasn’t the only one. Nearby, a man and woman twirled in the sinuous style of partner dance called Brazilian Zouk and groups of K-pop dancers swerved their hips in unison. Passengers flowed out of elevators, some stopping to watch, some rushing by with their luggage.</p><p>“If you ever want to find the culmination of what New York is as a culture, but expressing itself through dance,” Lockhorn, 24, said, “this is a good place to find it.”</p><p>Penn Station, the transit hub for hurrying commuters and Amtrak riders, has a side gig. Its wide, lower level corridor — specifically the passageway leading to the Moynihan Train Hall from Track 7 to Track 16 of the Long Island Rail Road — is an unlikely dance studio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Officially called the West End Concourse, the corridor has a lot going for it: It’s easily accessible, the floors are spacious and smooth, and there are public restrooms, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/nyregion/nyc-bill-public-bathrooms.html" title="">rarity</a> in New York City.</p><p>It’s a ready-made stage for all sorts of group and partnered dance, including hip-hop, K-pop and salsa. Reflective glass windows overlooking the tracks double as mirrors. Rows of blue lights overhead make for pleasing visuals when filmed. The biggest draw? It’s free.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/multimedia/24Penn-Dancers-02-pcwg/24Penn-Dancers-02-pcwg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/multimedia/24Penn-Dancers-02-pcwg/24Penn-Dancers-02-pcwg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/multimedia/24Penn-Dancers-02-pcwg/24Penn-Dancers-02-pcwg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="In a corridor of Penn Station, a dancer flips his partner upside down.

On warmer days, the Foolish Funkateers often meet outdoors near City Hall.</p><p>But, Lockhorn said, “this is what we call home on days where we can’t do that.”</p><p>Groups stake out a section of the corridor, typically spanning one or two train tracks, to make a kind of mini studio. The slanted windows descend into a flat ledge, perfect for resting water bottles, speakers and cellphones that capture polished choreography.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The only drawback, said Destiny Rodriguez, a K-pop dancer with the group <a href="https://www.instagram.com/v3rscrewnyc/?hl=zh-cn" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">V3RS Crew NYC</a>, is that it’s louder than a studio. “It’s more open,” she said. “But we still work with it, and we get everything done perfectly.”</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/22/penn-dancers-15007-cover/penn-dancers-15007-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/22/penn-dancers-15007-cover/penn-dancers-15007-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/22/138149_1_penn-dancers-15007_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The K-pop dance group V3RS Crew NYC rehearsing for a coming performance in Times Square.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Penn Station’s lower level isn’t really a substitute for a light-flooded New York dance studio.

It’s a prohibitive price for the dancers, mostly unpaid, who spend many hours preparing for performances and competitions or creating videos for fun.</p><p>And the transit hub has at least one thing those studios lack: random audiences who are quickly delighted.</p><p>Luke Fletcher, who had come to New York on a day trip from Boston with his 15-year-old son, said he was charmed to see dancers while waiting for his train home. “I just find it amazing,” he said, “that even during the week, they’re doing it.”</p><p>Kai Fritz, a K-pop dancer with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/notshydancecrew/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Not Shy Dance Crew</a>, makes the hourlong trek on the No. 2 train from the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush a few times a week.

And Fritz said Not Shy Dance Crew had gone unbothered for the most part, but had been asked at times to turn the music down.</p><p>The concourse lives in a kind of gray area. Penn Station, Donovan said, is owned by Amtrak, but the passageway is managed and policed by the Long Island Rail Road, which has its own rules of conduct, as does the adjacent New York City subway.</p><p>And unlike buskers, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/nyregion/subway-musicians-auditions-mta.html" title="">apply to perform</a> in the subways, these dancers don’t fall under a clear jurisdiction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>They don’t perform for tips.
