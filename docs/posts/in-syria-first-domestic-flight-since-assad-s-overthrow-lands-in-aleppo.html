Workers rushed to remove about a dozen empty ammunition boxes, gas masks and helmets from a grassy patch next to the runway.</p><p>When the Syrian Air flight from Damascus landed, more than an hour behind schedule, it was greeted by a large crowd of journalists and a phalanx of security personnel, including military police officers and civil defense workers, standing by in case anything went wrong.</p><p>But its arrival was otherwise smooth — a sign, the rebels who ousted Mr. al-Assad as president 10 days ago hope, that Syria’s new transitional government will be able to run the country. As part of that, they hope to provide war-weary civilians with basic services, including domestic and international flights.</p><p>“We consider this a big accomplishment — we are coming to rebuild this country,” said Anas Rustum, who was appointed to oversee the Aleppo airport by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that led the offensive against the Assad government. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He said they were open to welcoming flights from all countries and airlines, touting “these results you are seeing in front of your eyes,” as the just-landed Airbus A320 sat on the tarmac behind him.</p><p>The flight was a chance for Syria’s new leaders to demonstrate not only technical competence in aviation but their ability to provide security: On the roof of the terminal building, a security officer armed with a rifle watched over the scene below.</p><p>The flight marked a new chapter for Syria as well as the airport itself. Throughout Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war, the civilian facility was used by the Assad government to stage attacks on rebels and civilians living in rebel-held areas.</p><p>Ahmed Ibrahim, an airport control tower operator for nearly three decades, said the Assad forces had positioned a machine gun atop the control tower to fire on nearby neighborhoods.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/middleeast/syria-war-aleppo-rebels-government.html" title="">When the rebels captured Aleppo late last month</a>, the airport’s employees were afraid, Mr. Ibrahim said. But they were soon reassured as the rebel leadership called on all airport staff members to return to work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He said that domestic and international aviation could be a symbol of the new, post-Assad Syria.</p><p>“We’re hoping for there to be an opening to other countries,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Syria’s Civil War: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Al-Assad’s Soldiers:</strong> Syria’s new rulers say they will spare conscripts of Bashar al-Assad and pursue those who oversaw his regime’s abuses. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/world/middleeast/syria-assad-soldier-amnesty.html">Hundreds are lining up</a> to learn which promise applies to them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limits on Aid:</strong> Sanctions on the ousted Assad regime and other major obstacles could stymie Syria’s new leaders, threatening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/world/middleeast/syria-sanctions-aid-limits.html">exacerbate the humanitarian crisis</a> that was set off by the civil war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Austin Tice’s Disappearance:</strong> For years, the United States has collected tips about the whereabouts of the American journalist who vanished in Syria’s gruesome prison system. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/austin-tice-disappearance-syria.html">The list is long</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu’s Visit:</strong> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/world/middleeast/17syria-israel-netanyahu.html">met with military officers in Israeli-controlled territory in Syria</a>, according to his office.
