    <h1>In Syria, First Domestic Flight Since Assad’s Overthrow Lands in Aleppo</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shortly before the first domestic flight since Bashar al-Assad’s fall landed at Aleppo International Airport late Wednesday morning, the final preparations were still being made. Workers rushed to remove about a dozen empty ammunition boxes, gas masks and helmets from a grassy patch next to the runway.</p><p>When the Syrian Air flight from Damascus landed, more than an hour behind schedule, it was greeted by a large crowd of journalists and a phalanx of security personnel, including military police officers and civil defense workers, standing by in case anything went wrong.</p><p>But its arrival was otherwise smooth — a sign, the rebels who ousted Mr. al-Assad as president 10 days ago hope, that Syria’s new transitional government will be able to run the country. As part of that, they hope to provide war-weary civilians with basic services, including domestic and international flights.</p><p>“We consider this a big accomplishment — we are coming to rebuild this country,” said Anas Rustum, who was appointed to oversee the Aleppo airport by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that led the offensive against the Assad government. </p></div></div>
