Trump with an offer: His organization could help Mr. Trump carry out his plan to deport millions of people who are in the United States illegally.</p><p>“In support of our nation’s commitments to lawful immigration practices, I wanted to extend my willingness to assist, in cooperation with local law enforcement and community programs, to promote the safety and security of our state,” Mr. Teer wrote. “I am available for further discussion.”</p><p>He said Mr. Trump had yet to respond. A spokesperson for Mr. Trump’s transition team said the mass deportation plan would use state and federal resources, not private ones. But Mr. Teer’s offer was one of several recent efforts by far-right organizations, including some that have a history of taking it on themselves to patrol the border with Mexico, to insert themselves into the deportation plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Richard Mack, the founder of a group of hard-right sheriffs, <a href="https://americasvoice.news/video/Z1laeTiOQvq3lUB/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on television</a> last week that if members of his organization assisted with the initiative, it would make it “a lot easier and a lot cheaper and a lot more effective.” And last month, members of other militia-style groups also volunteered their services, with some discussing in private group chats their desire to get involved.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Richard Mack, the founder of a group of far-right sheriffs, said last week that it would be “a lot easier and a lot cheaper and a lot more effective” if members of his organization assisted with Mr. Trump’s initiative.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Amengual for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The push by some militia groups to help Mr. Trump reflects how one of his signature policy proposals mirrors ideas that once existed solely on the fringes of American politics. <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/border-vigilantes-law-enforcement-texas-arizona/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Militia groups, especially in border states</a>, have a long history of supporting enforcement efforts, sometimes taking migrants into custody on their own and turning them over to lawful authorities in agencies like the U.S. Border Patrol.</p><p>And while the new administration says it has no plans to call on the militias for help, the offer of assistance comes as Mr. Trump and his advisers confront an expensive and complex logistical problem: Deporting millions of undocumented immigrants would require an investment of resources in immigration enforcement that has never been seen.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-homan-immigration-border.html" title="">Tom Homan</a>, a former immigration official nominated to oversee the deportation effort, seemed open to the idea of using nontraditional personnel to carry out the plan.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6364544497112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with Fox News</a>, Mr. Homan spoke admiringly of the messages he received from “thousands of retired border patrol agents, retired military, that want to come in and volunteer to help this president secure the border and do this deportation operation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Advocates for immigrants have raised concerns that the policy could require hiring more than 30,000 new immigration agents and lead to thousands of “mixed status” families being torn apart. The plan has been criticized because of Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he might use military personnel to carry it out, operating under arcane laws like the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.</p><p>There is a long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/new-mexico-militia.html" title="">history of private vigilante groups patrolling</a> the 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico, sometimes leading to trouble.</p><p>In 2011, the leader of an anti-immigration border patrol group called the Minutemen American Defense was convicted of shooting and killing a 9-year-old and her father after breaking into their home in Arizona.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdtn/pr/middle-tennessee-man-charged-unlawful-possession-and-transfer-firearm-silencer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal prosecutors accused a member of a militia in Tennessee of gun charges</a> after he told an undercover agent that he was planning to travel to the southern border with an arsenal of weapons and commit acts of violence against agents because the United States was “being invaded” by migrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Border Patrol agents processing migrants after they were apprehended in Sunland Park, N.M., last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Any involvement by militia groups in the deportation plan, sanctioned or not, would also add an extra layer of complexity to the task of carrying out the proposal, adding to the complex legal and security risks at play.</p><p>“The dangers are considerable and could include militias engaging in violence against immigrants,” said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “Besides, these groups exist outside the legal rules that federal agents would have to follow. So under what authority would they even be taking part in this?”</p><p>In an interview by text message this week, Mr. Teer sought to play down such concerns. Echoing Mr. Trump, he said his organization — which takes its name from the supposed three percent of the U.S. colonial population that rose to fight the British — wanted to focus on immigrants with criminal records and had no problem with people “coming to this country and doing it the legal way.”</p><p>He also said that he and his compatriots could supplement the federal agents who would be called upon to execute Mr. Trump’s plan and would bring to bear on the initiative their experience in working at the border.</p><p>“We can supply man power to assist the government,” Mr. Teer wrote. “We have also been to the border, ran patrols to protect citizens.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Several members of Three Percenter chapters in Florida and California have been prosecuted in connection with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. One member of the Texas chapter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/us/politics/guy-reffitt-jan-6-trial.html" title="">Guy Wesley Reffitt</a>, was convicted in 2022 of wearing an illegal pistol on his hip as he helped to lead the charge on the Capitol at the first criminal trial stemming from the attack.</p><p>In his letter to Mr. Trump, Mr. Teer said he had been in contact with other organizations “across the South” that were also committed to helping with the deportation plan. He declined to identify the groups but said there were several in border states like Texas and California that wanted to be involved.</p><p>“They would all be willing to assist at the border and in rounding up illegals,” Mr. Teer’s letter said.</p><p>The leader of one such group, Arizona Border Recon, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/border-militias-immigrants-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently told Wired magazine</a> that he had been in contact with Mr. Trump’s transition team about helping with the deportation project.</p><p>“We’re in talks with a few different people,” said the group’s leader, Tim Foley. “We have a better lay of the land than the federal agents do.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Arizona Border Recon in 2019.

The Telegram posts were provided to The Times by a person who quietly monitors the chats.</p><p>“When President Trump closes the border,” a member of the group chat who called herself Mary Constitution Enforcer wrote on Nov. 6, “he needs the volunteer Militia there to do the job.”</p><p>In another private chat, one commenter recently wrote, “I’m going to be extremely happy if they would deputize civilians in the war on invasion from the borders.”</p><p>Another user, employing the screen name Pavel, replied directly to the post.</p><p>“Yes sir,” the person wrote, “I’ve been inquiring into that w some close to this admin.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
