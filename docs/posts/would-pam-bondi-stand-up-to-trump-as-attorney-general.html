She is amply qualified, on paper, to serve as the nation’s top law enforcement official. But Ms. Bondi’s recent public statements, including her false claims about 2020 election fraud and her vow to prosecute Mr. Trump’s perceived political enemies, raise pressing concerns about whether she possesses the independence and credibility necessary to lead the Department of Justice.</p><p>If confirmed, Ms. Bondi will wield extraordinary power. In 1940, the attorney general, Robert Jackson, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2011/09/16/04-01-1940.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cautioned</a> that prosecutors have “more control over life, liberty and reputation than any other person in America.” As a supervisor explained it to me years ago when I first became a federal prosecutor: “We’re giving you the power to destroy people’s lives. Don’t screw it up.”</p><p>As attorney general, Ms. Bondi would oversee <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao/us-attorneys-listing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">94 regional U.S. attorney’s offices</a> staffed by over <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/236271/dl?inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">6,000 federal prosecutors</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/agencies/chart/map" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plus the</a> F.B.I.; Drug Enforcement Administration; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; U.S. Marshals Service; and Bureau of Prisons, with an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-fiscal-year-2025-funding-request-budget-proposal-uphold-rule-law-keep#:~:text=The%20President%20today%20submitted%20to,funding%20for%20the%20Justice%20Department." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual budget</a> over $37 billion.</p><p>By any objective measure, she is qualified for the job — far more so than Mr. Trump’s first pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, who was never a prosecutor and only briefly practiced law. She spent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/pamela-bondi-attorney-general-trump.html" title="">18 years</a> as a local prosecutor in Florida and served as the state’s attorney general from 2011 to 2019, focusing especially on shutting down <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/eleven-arrested-and-one-wanted-in-pill-mill-shutdown/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pill mills</a> and prosecuting <a href="https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/News/2015/March/FDLE%E2%80%99s-Operation-Human-Freedom-nets-15-arrests-for" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">human traffickers</a>. Dave Aronberg, a Democrat who recently completed his tenure as state attorney for Palm Beach County, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/23/pam-bondi-doj-attorney-general-trump-pick/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly said</a> Ms. Bondi is “no political hack” and “believes in the rule of law.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If anything, Ms. Bondi’s résumé most resembles that of Janet Reno, who spent <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/bio/reno-janet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">15 years</a> as the <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/journals/annualsurveyofamericanlaw/dedications/janetreno" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state attorney</a> for Miami-Dade County (called Dade County at the time) before serving as the U.S. attorney general from 1993 to 2001. That’s not to suggest Ms. Bondi is the next Ms. Reno. During her tenure, Ms. Reno emerged as the most fiercely independent attorney general of the modern era, often to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/us/janet-reno-dead.html" title="">consternation</a> of the president who had appointed her, Bill Clinton, and the Washington, D.C., power structure.</p><p>Ms. Bondi has a history of fierce loyalty to Mr. Trump. She <a href="https://apnews.com/article/things-to-know-pam-bondi-eec1d16075c7debda62223b475e3977d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">represented him</a> at his first impeachment trial, in 2020. And she has long supported him politically; in a 2016 <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/transcript-of-attorney-general-pam-bondis-speech-to-the-republican/2286207/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech</a> at the Republican National Convention, she gushed about Mr. Trump and, when the crowd began chanting “lock her up” about Hillary Clinton, said, “I love that.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
