They date from throughout the artist’s career, 1896 to 1972, and showcase Picasso’s expansive range. (She refers to her father as “Pablo.”)</p><p>“Some of them are really special, beautiful examples of various periods — from an incredible self-portrait to a later Marie-Thérèse,” said Larry Gagosian, referring to Picasso’s muse and mistress. “It’s very exciting to show works by arguably the most famous artist that’s ever lived that haven’t been seen.”</p><p>Only a few pieces are for sale — prices are not publicly disclosed — and Ms. Picasso said she aimed to show the many attributes of her father through the artworks. “They can be both very soft and strong at the same time,” she said. “It’s all of the things that make Picasso who he is.

Pablo Picasso severed contact with both Claude and Paloma after the book’s publication, and never contacted them again, which Ms. Picasso has described as painful.</p><p>“When my mother wrote the book, she wanted to make him less of a god and more of a man,” Ms. Picasso said in the gallery interview. “And it doesn’t make him less great where he’s great. He’s the greatest. But he can also have weaknesses. And that’s OK.</p><p>“Even though you can criticize him,” she continued, “that doesn’t make his work irrelevant.”</p><p>Despite her father’s reputation for mistreating women, Ms. Picasso has insisted that he was a man of his time and that some of the accusations are exaggerated. “My father didn’t only have relationships with very young girls,&#34; she <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/mediterranean/20241001/9987441/paloma-picasso-father-art-pablo-jewelry-francoise-gilot-administrator-legacy-designer-museum-barcelona.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia last year. “He was 40 years older than my mother, but she was not a girl at all. I don’t think he was a man who abused women or thought they were inferior to men.” </p><p>The presence of Ms. Picasso herself permeates the Gagosian exhibition — in a portrait of her holding a doll, which has her face; in the wooden dolls that her father made for her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>There are also black-and-white family photographs, including one of Ms. Picasso in a short black bob and flip-flops, perched on a stool next to her father and their dog.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paloma Picasso at about 11 watching her father dedicating “Faune (Pour mon ami E.

But then she had something of an epiphany upon realizing that she would want to meet the daughter of Charlie Chaplin. “I thought, ‘Well, if I want to meet Geraldine Chaplin,” she said, “I should not be upset when people want to meet me because I’m the daughter of Picasso.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>She was 24 when her father <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/09/archives/picasso-is-dead-in-france-at-91-picasso-dies-at-his-villa-in.html" title="">died</a> in 1973, and felt in part responsible for preserving, protecting and promoting his legacy. “When you are the daughter of somebody that famous — and for such good reasons — you have this sense that you have to share with the rest of the world,” she said.</p><p>She and Claude entered a legal fight that in 1974 established them as legitimate heirs. And in 1989, after years of squabbling among all Picasso’s heirs including his widow, Jacqueline Roque, over the distribution of the thousands of artworks he left behind and commercial rights to his name, a French court appointed Claude as the estate’s administrator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paloma stands behind the sculpture “Visage Tête de Femme Bleue” (Blue Head of a woman). “Why should we expect him to be perfect?” she said of her father.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Estate of Pablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Sam Hellmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Claude sometimes clashed with his half sibling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/25/arts/maya-ruiz-dead.html" title="">Maya Ruiz-Picasso</a>, the daughter of the French model Marie-Thérèse Walter, over how to run the administration.
