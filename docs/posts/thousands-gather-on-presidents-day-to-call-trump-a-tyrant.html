The members of an a cappella group sang the national anthem by the Capitol Reflecting Pool. The audience burst into applause after the final line: “And the home of the brave.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s our anthem, it’s our flag, it belongs to us,” said Shawn Morris, the president of Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington, D.C. “We wanted to take it back.”</p><p>The major group organizing the protest identified itself as the <a href="https://www.fiftyfifty.one/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50501 movement</a>, a grass roots effort to push back against what it views as Mr. Trump’s second term “overreach” in reshaping of the government. Sarah Parker, the executive director of 50501’s member organization Voices of Florida, said the nationwide protests were fueled by a Reddit post that was written and commented by those who were angered from Mr. Trump’s actions and looking for ways to act upon their frustrations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Brandon Bell/Getty Images"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/multimedia/17DC-PROTESTS-GRID-01-hbvw/17DC-PROTESTS-GRID-01-hbvw-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/multimedia/17DC-PROTESTS-GRID-01-hbvw/17DC-PROTESTS-GRID-01-hbvw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/multimedia/17DC-PROTESTS-GRID-02-hbvw/17DC-PROTESTS-GRID-02-hbvw-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/multimedia/17DC-PROTESTS-GRID-02-hbvw/17DC-PROTESTS-GRID-02-hbvw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Fred Greaves/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/multimedia/17dc-protests-grid-01-pcbg/17dc-protests-grid-01-pcbg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/multimedia/17dc-protests-grid-01-pcbg/17dc-protests-grid-01-pcbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-3-" data-credit="Jake May | Mlive.Com/The Flint Journal, via Associated Press"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/multimedia/17dc-protests-grid-02-pcbg/17dc-protests-grid-02-pcbg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/17/multimedia/17dc-protests-grid-02-pcbg/17dc-protests-grid-02-pcbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Protests on Presidents&#39; Day in major cities spanned the country, including in (clockwise from top left) Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Flint, Mich., and Sacramento, Calif.

Elon Musk has got to go.” In Austin, outside the Texas Capitol, a video from a local CBS affiliate showed a woman, who identified herself as Kristin Jenn, taking the microphone while wearing a placard saying, “Donald Trump stole my job.”</p><p>“The National Park Service was hit very hard on Friday. A number of my co-workers lost their jobs,” she told the crowd. “They cannot take away my job, force me to get a government handout and then call me a parasite.”</p><p>Ms. Jenn said she was middle-aged and earning less than $50,000 a year in her federal job. Organizers in Austin said their aim was to push back against Project 2025, a conservative think tank’s plan for a Republican presidency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/us/politics/project-2025-trump-actions.html" title="">that has been mirrored</a> in a series of Mr. Trump’s executive orders.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Minho Kim covers breaking news and climate change.
