The members of an a cappella group sang the national anthem by the Capitol Reflecting Pool. The audience burst into applause after the final line: “And the home of the brave.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s our anthem, it’s our flag, it belongs to us,” said Shawn Morris, the president of Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington, D.C. “We wanted to take it back.”</p><p>The major group organizing the protest identified itself as the <a href="https://www.fiftyfifty.one/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50501 movement</a>, a grass roots effort to push back against what it views as Mr. Trump’s second term “overreach” in reshaping of the government. Sarah Parker, the executive director of 50501’s member organization Voices of Florida, said the nationwide protests were fueled by a Reddit post that was written and commented by those who were angered from Mr. Trump’s actions and looking for ways to act upon their frustrations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><figcaption><span>Protests on Presidents&#39; Day in major cities spanned the country, including in (clockwise from top left) Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Flint, Mich., and Sacramento, Calif.

Under the arch, they held up American flags and handwritten signs like “Stop the Coup” and “No Billionaire Kings,” alluding to the role of the tech billionaire Elon Musk in Mr. Trump’s efforts to shrink and remake the federal work force.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Dominic Santiago, 29, an artist from Flatbush, Brooklyn, said he came to show solidarity with other New Yorkers who oppose the Trump administration.</p><p>“I have faith because of these demonstrations,” he said. “I have faith that we can change things.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protester at a demonstration in Washington Square Park in Manhattan on Monday lifted a painting of Elon Musk with a crown emblazoned with “DOGE,” a reference to his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Lillian Bacon, 25, a college student majoring in political science, said: “I’m here today to fight for democracy and fight for the liberty and dignity of all people.”</p><p>It was her first time participating in a public protest. She said she has become furious and disappointed with Mr. Trump, Mr. Musk and Republican leaders over what she saw as their violation of a constitutional separation of powers. “I’m hoping there will be solidarity among all American people even if they did vote for Trump,” she said.</p><p>Protesters also gathered on the steps of the Arkansas State Capitol. Among them was Tanya Hollifield, an artist in Little Rock. “I took my sign that said ‘Fight Fascism Everywhere,’” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I think they’re tearing down the whole system of checks and balances and the Elon Musk coup, or takeover, is one of the current things I’m really upset about,” she said. </p><p>In downtown Atlanta, a crowd gathered outside the State Capitol chanting, “Hey, hey, ho, ho. Elon Musk has got to go.” In Austin, outside the Texas Capitol, a video from a local CBS affiliate showed a woman, who identified herself as Kristin Jenn, taking the microphone while wearing a placard saying, “Donald Trump stole my job.”</p><p>“The National Park Service was hit very hard on Friday. A number of my co-workers lost their jobs,” she told the crowd. “They cannot take away my job, force me to get a government handout and then call me a parasite.”</p><p>Ms. Jenn said she was middle-aged and earning less than $50,000 a year in her federal job. Organizers in Austin said their aim was to push back against Project 2025, a conservative think tank’s plan for a Republican presidency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/us/politics/project-2025-trump-actions.html" title="">that has been mirrored</a> in a series of Mr. Trump’s executive orders.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephanie-saul">More about Stephanie Saul</a></span></p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/winnie-hu">More about Winnie Hu</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
