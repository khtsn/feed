    <h1>Severe Storms Cause Travel Delays Across the U.S. as Tornadoes Threaten the South</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thousands of flights around the country were delayed or canceled on Saturday because of severe weather, disrupting travel for many returning home after the holidays.</p><p>More than 9,000 flights within, into or out of the United States were delayed, and more than 300 others were canceled as of Saturday evening, according to data from <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FlightAware</a>. The delays were roughly as widespread as the ones on previous days.</p><p>As of Saturday evening, more than half of the flights originating from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston were delayed, according to FlightAware. About half of the flights were also delayed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. At New Yorkâ€™s Kennedy International Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said flights that were pushed back had an average delay of more than two hours.</p><p>Inclement weather, or the threat of it, was affecting several different regions in the United States. In the West, large bands of moisture in the sky led to heavy rain and snow warnings in some areas. In the South, severe storms were expected over the weekend, and several tornadoes were reported in the Houston area on Saturday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/tornado-texas-dead.html" title="">killing</a> at least one person and injuring four others. A storm system moving toward the Northeast also threatened to bring rain and snow.</p></div></div>
