    <h1>Thị trường Mỹ &#39;đóng băng&#39; tại hội chợ thương mại lớn nhất Trung Quốc</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the man replied that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-deported-migrant.html" title="">the Supreme Court had ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release</a>, others in the audience began piling on. Some noted that Mr. Grassley chairs the Judiciary Committee, which oversees immigration policy and judges, prompting the senator to stammer, then fall silent and wait for the shouting to die down before trying to respond.</p><p>“El Salvador is an independent country,” Mr. Grassley said. “The president of that country is not subject to our U.S. Supreme Court.”</p><p>The crowd practically erupted in jeers.</p><p>The discussion was representative of the tone throughout the town hall, a standing-room-only event in Fort Madison, Iowa, in which the eight-term senator was repeatedly pressed about why he was not doing more to rein in the Trump administration.</p><p>Though at least two members of the crowd wore shirts suggesting they supported the president, Mr. Grassley often struggled to be heard over his audience. They peppered him with questions about Mr. Trump’s tariffs, his sweeping immigration policies, massive cuts to the federal government and the future of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Grassley was asked directly whether he was “proud of Trump.”</p><p>“There’s no president I have agreed with 100 percent of the time,” he answered.</p></div></div>
