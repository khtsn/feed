Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a senior figure in the Russian General Staff who was directly involved in planning operations. The investigators said that they had opened a criminal inquiry into the explosion, which took place in the town of Balashikha, east of Moscow.</p><p>The explosion came as Russian state news agencies reported that Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy, was probably in Moscow. Mr. Witkoff was expected to conduct another round of high-profile negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin over ending the war in Ukraine and re-establishing the bilateral relationship between Russia and the United States. Mr. Putin has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-trump.html" title="">cast aside Mr. Trump’s calls</a> for a quick peace in Ukraine, and Russia’s airstrikes on civilian targets appear to be increasing.</p><p>General Moskalik’s death is the latest in a series of fatalities among Kyiv’s opponents inside Russia. The Ukrainian authorities had no immediate comment when contacted about the killing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In February, a prominent pro-Russia separatist figure from Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/world/europe/pro-russia-leader-ukraine-killed-moscow.html" title="">Armen Sarkisyan, was killed</a> when a bomb exploded inside a gated residence in Moscow. Ukrainian officials did not comment on the blast at the time.</p><p>At the end of December, a general in charge of the Russian military’s nuclear and chemical weapons protection forces, Igor Kirillov, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/world/europe/russian-general-bombing-moscow.html" title="">killed by a bomb</a> near the entry to a residential building in Moscow. An official with Ukraine’s security service, known as the S.B.U., said at the time that Ukraine was responsible for the killing.</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
