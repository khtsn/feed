Brian Kemp of Georgia has decided against running for Senate in 2026, robbing Republicans of their top potential recruit against Senator Jon Ossoff, who is seen as the chamber’s most vulnerable Democrat on the ballot next year.</p><p>Mr. Kemp is a popular two-term governor who won re-election in 2022 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/politics/brian-kemp-david-perdue-georgia-governor-trump.html" title="">despite a primary challenge</a> fueled by President Trump, who stewed publicly over Mr. Kemp’s refusal to indulge his false claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent.</p><p>Top Republicans had nonetheless sought to woo Mr. Kemp into the Senate race, with Senators John Thune, the majority leader, and Tim Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/15/thune-kemp-georgia-senate-race" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">making a recent visit</a>. Polls had shown he would have been a formidable challenger to Mr. Ossoff, who narrowly won election in 2020.</p><p>“I have decided that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for me and my family,” Mr. Kemp <a href="https://x.com/briankempga/status/1919462223128203357?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> on Monday, saying he had spoken that day with Mr. Trump and with Senate leadership about his decision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The news of Mr. Kemp’s decision comes as he is gathered with supporters and donors in Sea Island, Ga., for a three-day retreat where top donors have been asked to give as much as $100,000 to serve as an “executive chair.”</p><p>The fact that Mr. Kemp, 61, continues to vacuum up cash as he bypasses a Senate bid leaves open the possibility that he could seek even higher office in 2028.</p><p>Mr. Kemp’s complicated relationship with Mr. Trump had loomed over a potential Senate campaign.</p><p>Mr. Trump publicly attacked Mr. Kemp in 2024 while campaigning in Georgia — calling him “Little Brian Kemp” — and complained publicly that Mr. Kemp’s wife was not supporting him, either. “Leave my family out of it,” Mr. Kemp <a href="https://x.com/BrianKempGA/status/1819851284343832838" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responded</a>.</p><p>Mr. Kemp and Mr. Trump eventually <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/03/trump-kemp-appear-together-first-time-2020-00182434" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeared together</a> and their relationship improved. But the governor has never engaged in the type of performative groveling that so many Republicans have done to stay in the president’s good graces.</p><p>Mr. Ossoff has been banking cash, raising $11 million in the first quarter of 2025, to prepare for what is expected to be one of the nation’s toughest races next year. He has not shied away from criticizing Mr. Trump, despite running in a state the president won last year, accusing him of having “authoritarian impulses” and a “desire to rule as a king.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This country was founded on a rejection of kings, and my view is that the American people have no interest in this new experiment in monarchy that this president is trying to impose,” <a href="https://x.com/SenOssoff/status/1917282647815967130" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said recently</a>.</p><p>Several prominent Georgia Republicans could run, especially with Mr. Kemp out of the race. The list includes Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene; Representative Mike Collins; John King, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politically-georgia/john-king-outlines-potential-run-for-us-senate-if-brian-kemp-stays-out/YEUB5FFYZNEBDOYUOCM6ZSUMLQ/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the insurance commissioner</a>; and Tyler Harper, the agriculture commissioner, who <a href="https://x.com/TylerHarperGA/status/1894794688705491153" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a photo of himself</a> in February at the National Republican Senatorial Committee offices.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shane Goldmacher is a Times national political correspondent.</p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent for The Times, reporting on President Trump.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/brian-kemp">Brian Kemp</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jon-ossoff">Jon Ossoff</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Foreign Film Tariff: </strong>President Trump said he would impose a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/business/trump-tariffs-movies.html">100 percent tariff on movies “produced” outside the United States,</a> saying the issue poses a national security threat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clean Energy in Alaska: </strong>Republicans in Congress are clashing over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits that are a lifeline for some of their constituents.
