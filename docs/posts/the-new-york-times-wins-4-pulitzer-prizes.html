ProPublica won the award for public service, considered the most prestigious of the Pulitzers, for its <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/life-of-the-mother" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coverage</a> of the impact of state abortion bans across the country.

The Pulitzer board credited her with “delivering piercing commentary on powerful people and institutions with deftness, creativity — and a fearlessness that led to her departure from the news organization after 17 years.”</p><p>Reuters was awarded the investigative reporting prize for “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/drugs-fentanyl-supply-chain-process/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fentanyl Express</a>,” a series that examined the drug trade behind America’s opioid crisis. The investigation showed how easy it was to obtain the chemicals needed to make fentanyl from China and how the packages evaded customs inspections in Mexico and the United States.</p><p>The national reporting award went to the staff of The Wall Street Journal for its coverage of Elon Musk, the world’s richest man.
