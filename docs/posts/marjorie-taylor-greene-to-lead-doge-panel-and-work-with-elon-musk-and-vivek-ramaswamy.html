public transparency are critical,” he said.</p><p>Leading a panel alongside a federal agency whose name invokes an internet meme — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/world/asia/kabosu-doge-meme-dead.html" title="">the original “doge” was a Shiba Inu whose image spread widely</a> and who inspired a cryptocurrency that Mr. Musk endorsed — seemed to be a fitting job for Ms. Greene, a native on right-wing social media. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Over the past year, Ms. Greene has distinguished herself as one of the showiest members on the House Oversight Committee, the main investigative organ of the House.</p><p>Last year, during a hearing with whistle-blowers from the Internal Revenue Service, she showed sexually explicit images of Hunter Biden, the president’s son. “Parental discretion advised,” she said before unveiling her poster boards and drawing immediate condemnation from Democrats for her stunt.</p><p>In her statement on Thursday, she hinted that the same no-holds-barred style would guide her work on the new subcommittee. “No topic will be off the table,” she said.</p><p>Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, mocked the creation of the panel.</p><p>“So now a noted student of American government, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, will chair a subcommittee to work with two unvetted billionaires who stand to receive billions more in government contracts and subsidies from the government under Trump,” Mr. Raskin said.</p><p>Echoing President-elect Donald J. Trump’s signature use of caps lock, Ms. Greene added: “Our subcommittee’s work will expose people who need to be FIRED.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.
