The affected area spanned 600 miles, from Arica in the north — home to many of the country&#39;s copper mines — to Los Lagos in the south, they said. In Santiago, it knocked out traffic lights, stranded people in elevators and shut down the subway network.</p><p>By midnight, power had been restored for 90 percent of residential consumers, the National Electrical Coordinator said. Officials promised electricity would be restored to everyone by dawn.</p><p>The government had earlier announced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the regions affected. Schools in those areas will be closed on Wednesday, with about 300,000 students affected, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Today has been a difficult day for millions of countrymen,” Gabriel Boric, the president, said at a news conference on Tuesday night.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/multimedia/25xp-chile-01-zbfh/25xp-chile-01-zbfh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/multimedia/25xp-chile-01-zbfh/25xp-chile-01-zbfh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/multimedia/25xp-chile-01-zbfh/25xp-chile-01-zbfh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People lined up in the dark to get food at a food cart." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/multimedia/25xp-chile-01-zbfh/25xp-chile-01-zbfh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/multimedia/25xp-chile-01-zbfh/25xp-chile-01-zbfh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/multimedia/25xp-chile-01-zbfh/25xp-chile-01-zbfh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/multimedia/25xp-chile-01-zbfh/25xp-chile-01-zbfh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7f5cb79e-efc7-583f-be71-9b857c2931bd" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People queuing to buy food amid a large power outage in the city of Arica on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alexander Infante/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As officials scrambled to restore power, nonfunctioning stoplights caused traffic chaos in Santiago and masses of commuters were evacuated from the subway, spilling out onto the streets and vying for spots on replacement buses.</p><p>“People were sprinting everywhere trying to get to the buses,” said Patricio Rodriguez, 35. “Everyone was desperate to get home.”</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez said he had to walk nine miles to get to his aunt’s house. “People were driving the wrong way up the main roads, it was chaos,” he said. “It was like the Wild West — it felt lawless.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Boric warned that the recovery was slow and unstable, and the situation remained precarious.</p><p>He blamed the country’s power companies for allowing the outage to occur and for not restoring power earlier, adding, “This is outrageous.” The outage was caused by failure of a transmission system, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A crowded bus in Santiago on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Javier Torres/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Soldiers in trucks were deployed to affected areas to enforce the curfew, while the national police was sent to direct traffic and patrol streets, according to the authorities.

Elected president in 2021 on a left-wing platform, he called a convention to draft a new constitution to replace the one that had been in place since the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.</p><p>The new text, which would have enshrined left-wing policies in one of Latin America’s most conservative nations, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/world/americas/chile-constitution-no.html" title="">rejected by voters</a> in 2022, as was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/17/world/americas/chile-election-results-constitution-referendum.html" title="">more conservative version</a> the following year.
