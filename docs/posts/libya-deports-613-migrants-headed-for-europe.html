The mass deportation is part of a common pattern: North African governments, funded by the European Union to tackle migration, using brutal tactics to block sub-Saharan Africa migrants from heading to Europe.</p><p>The 613 men reached Niger’s closest town to the Libyan border on Jan. 3, disheveled and hungry, some barefoot and sick after months of detention and days of travel across the Sahara. Two of the men died shortly after arriving in Niger.</p><p>“I lived through hell,” said Salmana Issoufou, one of the men. Mr. Issoufou, 18, said he had been beaten by Libyan prison guards with wires and weapons throughout his eight-month detention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As anti-migrant sentiment rises across Europe, from France to Germany to Hungary, the citizens of sub-Saharan Africa trying to reach the continent are being pushed back by North African governments in proportions unseen in years. The E.U. has signed bilateral agreements with Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Mauritania, that include financial support to curb migrant flows.</p><p>The strategy appears to be working: illegal border crossings dropped sharply in 2024, according to recent <a href="https://www.frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/irregular-border-crossings-into-eu-drop-sharply-in-2024-oqpweX" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> from the European Union’s border agency, Frontex.</p><p>But rights groups say the methods being used to keep sub-Saharan migrants from traveling to Europe include well-documented human rights violations, such as so-called desert dumps. Migrants have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/world/africa/tunisia-african-migrants.html" title="">abandoned in the Sahara</a> without food or water, or <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/youre-going-die-here-abuse-libyan-detention-centers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kept in North African prisons</a> where they face <a href="https://x.com/RefugeesinLibya/status/1876177125863989534" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">torture</a>, sexual violence and starvation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Migrants awaiting rescue in international waters in the central Mediterranean Sea last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Since Tunisia struck a deal with the European Union in 2023, it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/world/africa/tunisia-african-migrants.html" title="">dumped</a> more than 12,000 people, including children and pregnant women, into deserted areas of Libya, <a href="https://unsmil.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/n2437290.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>.
