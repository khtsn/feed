Elon Musk, who is slashing the Social Security Administration’s staff, has called it a “Ponzi scheme.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has asserted that Americans aren’t looking at the “day-to-day fluctuations” in their retirement savings.</p><p>And if automakers raise their prices because of Mr. Trump’s tariffs? “I couldn’t care less,” the president told Kristen Welker of NBC.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Democrats say the comments show how clueless Mr. Trump and his friends are about the lives of most Americans, and that this is what happens when billionaires run the economy. Republicans counter that highlighting the quotes as unfair cherry picking, and that in the long run everyone will benefit from their policies, even if there’s pain now. Psychologists say that extreme wealth does change people and their views of those who have less.</p><p>Whoever is right, it is safe to say that almost no one thinks the comments have been politically helpful for Mr. Trump, or calming for Americans.</p><p>“You have to laugh to keep from crying,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. “What did they say about the old New York Mets? ‘Can’t anybody here play this game?’” (Mr. Ayres was referring to what the manager Casey Stengel once said about his hapless 1962 Mets, and the subsequent title of a book by Jimmy Breslin.)</p><p>For the record, Forbes put Mr. Trump’s net worth at $4.2 billion on April 8, down $500 million from April 2, the day the president rolled out his tariffs. Forbes estimated the net worth of Mr. Musk, the world’s richest man, as $364 billion on April 17 and Mr. Lutnick’s as $3 billion the same day. Mr. Bessent, formerly the top investor for the billionaire liberal philanthropist George Soros, listed assets in excess of $700 million on his financial disclosure form this year but is thought to be worth much more.</p><p>The opposition has swiftly pounced on their comments. Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and minority leader, said that Mr. Trump and his rich friends live in a “billionaires’ bubble,” while Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, called out Mr. Lutnick on social media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Maybe your mother-in-law wouldn’t complain if she didn’t get her Social Security check, but tens of millions of seniors struggling to survive would,” Mr. Sanders wrote. “How out of touch are you, not to realize that?”</p><p>A lot, at least according to pollsters.</p><p>“If someone is concerned about their financial well-being, take them at their word,” said Frank Luntz, a longtime focus group leader, pollster and consultant, speaking about the widespread fears of rising prices and falling stocks brought on by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. He said the president understood voters’ anxieties during the 2024 campaign, when he repeatedly promised to bring down grocery prices, but seems to have forgotten them now.</p><p>“If you knew they were struggling in October, why do you dismiss their struggling in April?” Mr. Luntz asked. He added that “the word that is missing in all of this, from Elon and the president, is empathy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk, who has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and is slashing the agency that manages it, is the world’s richest man, with a net worth estimated around $364 billion.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Paul K. Piff, an associate professor of psychological science at the University of California, Irvine, has studied the psychology of the rich for nearly two decades. He said that research shows that as a person’s wealth increases, more often than not empathy and compassion for others decreases. Professor Piff cautioned that there are exceptions, and that he was not speaking specifically about the billionaires in the Trump administration.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But he said excessive wealth has profound effects on a person’s character. “You certainly have more power and more influence over people in your life,” he said. Money, he added, “buys you space and distance from people, and alongside that comes this increased focus on your own self. It’s not a difficult stretch to say that you lose touch for what it’s like for lots and lots of people.”</p><p>Susan Pinker, a Canadian psychologist who was a writer for The Wall Street Journal’s Mind &amp; Matter column about human behavior and earlier wrote The Business Brain column for The Globe and Mail, said the rich live in their own world.</p><p>“The reason why the super wealthy at the helm of government can’t imagine how people might be distressed by some of their policies is that they don’t really see them that clearly,” she said. “We’re not really built from an evolutionary perspective to feel like we’re at home with everybody. The stronger our in-group, the more likely we are to exclude others.”</p><p>Steven Pinker, the Harvard psychologist who is Ms. Pinker’s brother, said he was not convinced that the billionaires’ comments were because of their wealth. “A more immediate cause may be cognitive dissonance,” he said, referring to the psychological state that can occur when people’s actions don’t align with their beliefs.</p><p>“In the case of the Trump administration,” Professor Pinker said, “they have little choice but to twist themselves into artisanal pretzels in order to defend the indefensible.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A White House spokesman, Kush Desai, said in response to the criticism of Mr. Trump’s remarks about the stock market and potentially higher prices that “the only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people — such as addressing the national emergency posed by our country running chronic trade deficits.” White House officials also point out that Mr. Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security benefits.</p><p>Recent polls show that Mr. Trump’s approval rating has declined since his inauguration, including a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/article/the-definitive-networth-of-donaldtrump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quinnipiac survey</a> conducted in early April that found that 53 percent disapproved of Mr. Trump and 41 percent approved. It was a significant shift from a <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3918" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quinnipiac poll</a> at the start of the administration, when 43 percent disapproved and 46 percent approved.</p><p>Although Mr. Trump’s drop in recent polls is similar to those of Presidents Joseph R. Biden Jr., Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at this point in their terms, he has had a sharp decrease in support among independents. In the recent Quinnipiac poll, 58 percent of independents disapproved of Mr. Trump and 36 percent approved, compared to 46 percent who disapproved of him in January and 41 percent who approved.</p><p>The polls do not show how much the recent turmoil over tariffs and the stock market has affected voters’ views of Mr. Trump. But the Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said most current surveys give Mr. Trump negative marks on his handling of the economy, a source of his strength against Mr. Biden during the 2024 campaign.</p><p>In her view, the remarks of the Trump billionaires show how much they talk among themselves.</p><p>“They play golf with billionaires, they have dinner with billionaires, they go to Mar-a-Lago,” she said. “When was the last time any of them bought a dozen eggs or a quart of milk?”</p><p>Or as Mr. Trump said when he kicked off a Mar-a-Lago dinner with friends after his tax cuts became law in December 2017, “You all just got a lot richer.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabeth Bumiller is a writer-at-large for The Times.
