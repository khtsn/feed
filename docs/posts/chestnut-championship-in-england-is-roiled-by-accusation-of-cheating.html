The accusations revolve around a winner of the World Conker Championships, and if he used a metal conker to defeat his opponents’ conkers.</p><p>If you’re not a resident of the British Isles, you might be a little confused by that sentence.</p><p>A conker is a buckeye chestnut that falls from trees and can be found all over Britain and Ireland in the fall. (For the sake of simplicity we will be using the English term throughout this story, so this is the last time you’ll be seeing the word chestnut.)</p><p>The competition, also known as conkers, goes like this: Holes are drilled through the conkers, and strings are threaded through each one, with one conker on a string for each competitor. Two opponents face off, with the goal of destroying the other person’s conker with your own by whipping one against the other. Last person standing with an intact conker wins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Children in Britain play the game in playgrounds and parks in the fall. And once a year, several hundred adults gather for the <a href="https://www.worldconkerchampionships.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Conker Championships</a> in the tiny English village of Southwick, which has about 160 residents. This year, the competition drew 256 contestants and about 2,500 spectators, said Charles Whalley, one of the championships’ committee members.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Neil Morbey, a competitor, wears a conker-themed hat.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Noble/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A conker-adorned crown, presented to the winner.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Noble/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But this year, the men’s competition has become embroiled in controversy.

When reached by phone on Tuesday, he said he was “not prepared to comment on any of that,” referring to the accusations.</p><p>Organizers of the event said they were investigating by examining photos and videos taken by spectators during the event, but said so far they had no reason to believe Mr. Jakins cheated by using the steel conker.</p><p>“We’re in the middle of a bit of a scandal,” Mr. Whalley said in an interview on Tuesday. “So far our investigation is showing that nothing untoward happened.”</p><p>Mr. Jakins praised the winner of the women’s competition — Kelci Banschbach, the first American to win a conkers championship — and said he liked participating partly because the event aims to raise money for charity.</p><p>“It’s something to do for conkers season,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bag of conkers is seen before play.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Noble/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Riley, a pensioner from Chelsea, taking part in the championships.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Noble/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The story quickly spread through British — and some international — news media on Tuesday, a welcome reprieve from hard news and more consequential investigations.

But, she added, the championship still drew people from all over the world.</p><p>Ms. Banschbach said she had heard only snippets about the cheating scandal because she had been at work all day.</p><p>“I honestly have no idea, that seems kind of crazy,” she said. “It’s a very wholesome event.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Competitors taking part in the annual World Conker Championships in Southwick on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Noble/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Lifeline in Lebanon: </strong>Thousands have fled the town of Baalbek amid a barrage of Israeli airstrikes.
