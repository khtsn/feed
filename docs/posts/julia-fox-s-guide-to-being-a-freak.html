    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I remember being in fifth grade [on New York’s Upper East Side] and being exhausted from trying to pretend to be normal all the time. Once I went to middle school, that’s when the freak was unleashed: I’d go to St. Marks Place [in the East Village] and be enamored of the punk kids, with their spiky hair. Eventually they became my friends.</p><p>In New York, you can meet freaks from all over the world and connect. We latch on because it’s comforting. I don’t really hang out with straight people; I hang out with a lot of dolls. The years of masking, years of performing — it’s similar to what [trans people] go through, on some level, but obviously not to the same degree. [My housemate] <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/t-magazine/artists-new-york-city-culture.html" title="">Richie Shazam</a> and I have been friends since we were teenagers, so we’ve been at each other’s side through all the transitions and transformations. Richie’s definitely a freak, and freaks find each other. It’s a sixth sense.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>How to Be a Freak</h2><h4>The writer and performer Julia Fox gives a tutorial on being yourself and finding your fellow freaks.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>Hi, I’m Julia Fox, and today, we are going to learn how to unleash your inner freak. Let’s begin. My definition of a freak is someone who is unapologetically themselves. They’ve already figured out that they’re different, but they are no longer trying to hide it. I think part of being a freak is being delusional. It is being aggressive, because you have to make space in a world that is not built for you. Lesson 1: I think spend a lot of time alone. Really figure out who you are and feel comfortable being alone. A lot of time, it really does start with clothes, because clothes are signaling into the world of who we are. And some people won’t get it, but someone else might be like, ‘Oh, the shoes, she gets it.’ Going to places, going to shows, whether it’s an art show or a music show, and not just because everyone else is doing it. It has to actually resonate with you. I probably really came into my inner freak in middle school. That was when I started to meet other people who were also the weird catgirls that meow on the table. You didn’t have any catgirls? Oh, my god. I had a lot of catgirls in my school. I think the worst thing you can do as a freak is pretend. Take the mask off. Be yourself.

I’ll send them straight to my stylist. It’s an everyday occurrence. I hate that social media eats so much of my time, but sometimes you want to numb out.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>I take my Suboxone everywhere: It’s for people who were addicted to opioids. It prohibits any naughty behavior, and that’s definitely a reminder [of my freakiness]. I also take my vape everywhere. And my [3-year-old] son, but that’s different.</p><p>There will be times when I immediately go back to being that insecure 14-year-old girl. On the first day of my kid’s new school, I pulled up in my freak attire — these distressed leather Knwls mules, a huge Vetements blazer and oversize Margiela basketball shorts — and I saw the other moms dressed normally. They were all looking and talking about me, and I reverted to being a young girl: “Oh my God, <em>they know</em>. They’ve clocked that I’m different.” I don’t feel that insecurity often as an adult, but I felt it very quickly there. I was like, “I’m going to have to blend in.”</p><section data-id="100000009833738" data-testid="capsule-block"><hr/><h2 id="link-334c2378"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/freak-city" title="">Freak City</a></h2><p>New York has always attracted the most out-there artists. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/t-magazine/artists-new-york-city-culture.html" title="">Here, T looks at the singularly strange talents</a> who’ve built a metropolis unlike any other.

I bought a lot of memoirs [before releasing my own, “Down the Drain,” 2023], thinking they’d be guides but, when it came time to write, I was so past my deadline, I just had to do it. But I love Cat Marnell’s “How to Murder Your Life” (2017) — she’s the queen of the downtown freaks. And I’d recommend “Naked” (1997) by David Sedaris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It’s not easier [to try] to be normal … eventually freaks are like, “I’m going to be myself and live my truth because I can’t pretend anymore.” Pretending is draining; it’s exhausting; it’s depression. Being a freak’s not an easy thing, but it can be a very beautiful thing. That’s why I don’t get salty when people take inspiration from me. I want to guide more women, more queer people, to feel like, “Well, if she does it, I can, too.”</p><p><em>Julia Fox, 34, is a writer and performer who lives in Harlem, Manhattan.</em> <em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p><p>Set designer: James Rene at Jones MGMT.
