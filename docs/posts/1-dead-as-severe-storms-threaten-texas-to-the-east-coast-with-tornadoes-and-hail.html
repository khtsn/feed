About 10 percent of the county is without power, and a damage assessment was underway, he said.</p><p>The volatile setup was being driven by a cold front linked to a storm system that is moving through the Great Lakes and will collide with warm, moisture-rich air in the South, creating prime conditions for powerful thunderstorms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“To the warm side of that front in the South, we’ll have enough moisture and instability to get thunderstorms, and some of them could be severe,” said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.</p><h2 id="link-7e155b3f">The risk is expected to intensify on Sunday evening.</h2><p>The threat was expected to escalate Sunday evening, as storms that initially develop across Missouri and Illinois intensify while spreading into Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas and the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys.</p><p>The Storm Prediction Center said the severe potential will persist into Sunday night, as the storms merge into larger and more intense outbreaks.</p><p>The greatest threat for tornadoes is expected in eastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, western Tennessee, western Kentucky, southeastern Missouri and southern portions of Illinois and Indiana. Some tornadoes could be strong.</p><p>Forecasters also warned of very large hail, up to three inches in diameter, that would most likely fall across northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, Southern Illinois and western Ohio.
