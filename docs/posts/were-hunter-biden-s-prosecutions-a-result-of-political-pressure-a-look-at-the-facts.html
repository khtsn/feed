    <h1>Were Hunter Biden’s Prosecutions a Result of Political Pressure? A Look at the Facts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>U.S. prosecutors have broad discretion when deciding whether to bring cases and are governed by departmental guidelines. But such decisions are subject to a wide range of factors that determine whether they opt to charge, to seek an agreement or to drop the matter altogether, even when there is some evidence of criminality.</p><p>The prosecution of the younger Mr. Biden on gun charges was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/hunter-biden-gun-charges.html" title="">relatively rare.</a> Few people fitting his profile — a first-time, nonviolent offender accused of lying on a federal firearms application, who never used the gun to commit a crime — get serious prison time for the offenses charged in <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/hunter-biden-charging-documents/aba88c5a66ce4131/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the indictment</a>, according to former and current officials. He held onto the gun, a Colt Cobra .38, for less than two weeks, five years ago.</p><p>When officials with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reviewed Hunter Biden’s gun application several years ago, they believed the case most likely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/hunter-biden-gun-charges.html" title="">would have been dropped</a> if the offender were a lesser-known person, because the gun had not been used in any crime and because Mr. Biden had taken steps to get and stay sober, according to a former law enforcement official familiar with the situation.</p><p>It is harder to say whether Mr. Biden’s tax case, stemming from a five-year investigation into his foreign business dealings and profligate spending, was outside of norms. Such cases are not uncommon — although Mr. Biden’s legal team argued that, since he had fully paid his back taxes and the relevant penalties, a trial was unnecessary.</p><p>Justice Department officials were incensed by the suggestion that the cases were prosecuted for any reason other than merit. The special counsel in the tax case, David C. Weiss, pushed back against President Biden’s claims in a court filing on Monday, saying there “never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case.”</p></div></div>
