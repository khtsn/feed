The office then activated “emergency protocols” and began a search for the inmates, she said.</p><p>“We are actively working with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in a full-scale search operation,” Sheriff Hutson said. She said the office urged members of the public to remain alert and to notify law enforcement if they had information that could aid in the search.</p><p>The Sheriff’s Office was also beginning an investigation to determine how the inmates escaped and would examine “facility protocols, staff performance and physical security measures,” Sheriff Hutson said.</p><p>“Any lapses or failures that contributed to this incident will be addressed swiftly and with full accountability,” she told reporters at a news briefing, at which she declined to take questions.</p><p>The escape led to sharp criticism of the Sheriff’s Office from officials who questioned how 11 inmates had managed to escape and why the office had not immediately notified the public.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Someone clearly dropped the ball, and there’s no excuse for this,” Louisiana’s attorney general, Liz Murrill, said in <a href="https://x.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1923441108731953641" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on social media. She called for an investigation to determine what had happened. </p><p>“This is beyond unacceptable, and once these offenders are back in custody, there must be real accountability,” she said.</p><p>Jason Williams, the Orleans Parish district attorney, said in an interview on WDSU, a local television station, that the escape was “an unprecedented failure.” He expressed frustration that he, the public and the news media had not been notified immediately when the inmates escaped. </p><p>He raised the possibility of a grand jury investigation to examine who was involved. He said his office had also contacted witnesses involved in the inmates’ cases to notify them that the men had escaped. </p><p>“I’ve got a deep fear right now for people who were brave enough to come forward to testify in these cases,” he said. “This is a very dangerous situation that has only been made more dangerous because of the poor leadership and lack of transparency.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Maj. Silas Phipps Jr., a leader of the investigative bureau of the Sheriff’s Office, said that officials were “working every angle” to find the inmates.</p><p>“I just want to remind the public and anyone that may be assisting them that, if we identify you and can prove that you are assisting them, we will prosecute you along with them to the fullest extent of the law,” he said.</p><p>Sheriff Hutson told the New Orleans City Council in October that the Orleans Parish Justice Center had about 1,500 inmates, well above the 1,250-inmate cap set by the council and far more than the 900 inmates her staff could handle, <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/new-orleans-overcrowded-jail-needs-88-million-budget/article_e81324ba-9571-11ef-b297-1398c53a1522.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOLA.com reported</a> last year.</p><p>While violent crime in New Orleans was down, Sheriff Hutson said in the article, there had been an influx of people charged solely with misdemeanors such as trespassing, shoplifting and simple assault.</p><p>“We still have to hold them,” she told City Council during its annual budget hearing, NOLA.com reported. “It stresses our facilities.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Levenson covers breaking news for The Times from New York.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
