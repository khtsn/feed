At first, the National Park Service, which manages Manzanar as a tourist site and museum, said the baseball field was an archaeological site that couldn’t be disturbed. But he persisted, and today the baseball field looks much as it does in those old black-and-white pictures: a patch of dusty land, all dirt, with a pitcher’s mound, foul lines, a backstop and a small wooden grandstand behind home plate.</p><p>“Simple, Zen baseball in the desert” is how Mr. Kwong describes it.</p><p>Japanese American amateur teams have played in California for more than a century, drawing players ranging from teenagers who star on their high school teams to older people in their 60s. In the early days, before Jackie Robinson integrated the major leagues, the teams also fielded Latino and Black players.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/02nat-manzanar-baseball-58656-cover/02nat-manzanar-baseball-58656-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/02nat-manzanar-baseball-58656-cover/02nat-manzanar-baseball-58656-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/11/01/128981_1_02nat-manzanar-baseball-58656_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Standing on the mound, Michael Furatani, a pitcher for the Lodi JACL Templars, a team from the Central Valley, could see the old guard tower far down the right-field line.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I pretend I’m picking somebody off, and I look over my shoulder and you can see the guard tower,” said Mr. Furatani, 60, whose relatives were imprisoned in a camp in Wyoming during the war. “That really kind of sunk in. Holy smokes, this is where guys tried to forget.”</p><p>The games were sandwiched between Games 1 and 2 of the World Series, which was headlined by the Dodgers’ Japanese megastar Shohei Ohtani. Many of the amateur ballplayers were Dodgers fans still basking in the heroics of the previous night, when Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers’ first baseman and eventual World Series most valuable player, ended the game with a grand slam in the 10th inning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/02/multimedia/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/02/multimedia/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/02/multimedia/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/02/multimedia/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/02/multimedia/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/02/multimedia/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/02/multimedia/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz/02nat-manzanar-baseball-ftmz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/6c724b67-1612-5776-95c6-1392b42b60a4" decoding="async" width="600" height="417"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Photographs of the baseball field — taken by Ansel Adams, America’s most famous landscape photographer, who was commissioned by the government to take pictures of the camp in 1943.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ansel Adams, via Library of Congress</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“To me, it’s part of this day,” Jon Kaji, whose father was in Manzanar, said.</p><p>As a city councilman in Torrance, a city in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County with a large Japanese American population — about <a href="https://www.ltsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sb_nikkei_needs_assessment5.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">12 percent</a> of the city’s population of 147,000 — Mr. Kaji has helped secure friendship agreements with the hometowns of Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a Japanese star pitcher for the Dodgers.

(One of Mr. Kwong’s slogans, as he was promoting the project, was a play on a famous quotation from “Field of Dreams”: “If we build it, they will come. This time willingly.”)</p><h2 id="link-5b6a91d2">They Didn’t Take Away Baseball</h2><p>Long before Ohtani and long before World War II, baseball was an important part of the relationship between Japan and the United States. Horace Wilson, an educator from Maine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/05/sports/baseball/horace-wilson-japan-150.html" title="">introduced baseball to Japan</a> in 1872, and the country fell in love with the sport. Before the war, American big leaguers traveled to Japan for exhibition games, including a <a href="https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/baseball-history/1934-japan-tour-footage-uncovered" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">team with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig</a> as members.</p><p>Roughly 100 baseball teams played in Manzanar between 1942 and 1945, drawing crowds of a thousand people or more to watch games. Some teams, like the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/museodelvalle818/p/CV3lxA6v1ww/?locale=sl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">San Fernando Aces</a>, who won a camp championship, entered Manzanar together, bringing with them their uniforms and equipment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-22"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As part of the two exhibition games last weekend, a company that supplies vintage sports equipment for Hollywood productions brought old cleats, catcher’s masks, chest protectors and gloves from the era for use by the ballplayers.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“America imprisoned their own Americans only because of their race, but the irony is that they didn’t take away baseball,” said Kerry Yo Nagawa, an author and a historian of Japanese American baseball. “And instead of rejecting it, being bitter, because they took everything else away — Japanese Americans couldn’t speak their native language, many of the faiths you couldn’t practice in the camps initially — baseball was the one thing they gravitated to and embraced.”</p><p>For the many of the participants — like Mr. Furatani and Mr. Kaji, who had relatives in the camps — the event was deeply personal, an opportunity to reflect on history and baseball.</p><p>“Just thinking about what it was like back in the 40s when they were stuck here,” Mr. Kaji said. “To me, baseball has always been about connection.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-24"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/02nat-manzanar-baseball-99352-cover/02nat-manzanar-baseball-99352-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/02nat-manzanar-baseball-99352-cover/02nat-manzanar-baseball-99352-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/11/01/128986_1_02nat-manzanar-baseball-99352_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>As part of the two exhibition games last weekend, a company that supplies vintage sports equipment for Hollywood productions brought old cleats, catcher’s masks, chest protectors and gloves from the era for use by the ballplayers.
