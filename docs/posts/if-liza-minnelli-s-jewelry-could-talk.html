    <h1>If Liza Minnelli’s Jewelry Could Talk</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The scene had all the subtlety of a sequined sledgehammer: Liza Minnelli, a performer who has often been measured against her mother, the actress Judy Garland, was lounging on a sofa beneath fluorescent Warhol portraits of Ms. Garland, Ms. Minnelli and her father, the director Vincente Minnelli.</p><p>Ms. Minnelli, 78, was sitting in the living room of her apartment in West Hollywood, Calif., on a Monday afternoon in August, with a small entourage that included a manager, a personal photographer and Michael Feinstein, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/michael-feinstein" title="">a singer and pianist</a> she has collaborated with for years. Tabletops were packed with nearly arranged accolades and other detritus from her career in show business — a French <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/star-icon-and-now-an-officer-in-the-legion-of-honor/" title="">Legion of Honor</a> award here, some Golden Globes there.</p><p>Ms. Minnelli was wearing a red collared shirt over a black turtleneck and swingy black trousers — no shoes — along with silver bone cuffs and other jewelry designed by her close friend Elsa Peretti.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Ms. Peretti, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/fashion/elsa-peretti-dead.html" title="">died in 2021</a>, has long been associated with Tiffany &amp; Company: This is the 50th year that the brand has been selling her pieces. But Ms. Minnelli’s relationship with the Italian jewelry designer goes back even further. The women had a mutual friend in Halston, the American fashion designer born Roy Halston Frowick, who introduced them in the early 1970s. (Halston also introduced Ms. Peretti and Tiffany, in 1974.)</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/multimedia/27LIZA-ELSA-04-czgq/27LIZA-ELSA-04-czgq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/multimedia/27LIZA-ELSA-04-czgq/27LIZA-ELSA-04-czgq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/multimedia/27LIZA-ELSA-04-czgq/27LIZA-ELSA-04-czgq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A black-and-white photo of a group of people talking in a room.

Ms. Minnelli wore a yellow Halston gown when she accepted the Oscar for Best Actress in 1973 for her performance in “Cabaret.” In her television special “Liza With a Z,” for which Ms. Minnelli won an Emmy in 1973, her wardrobe included several pieces by Halston and Ms. Peretti, a white suit and silver bone cuffs among them.</p><p>Ms. Minnelli said Halston and Ms. Peretti helped create what became her signature look, which involved simple lines and slouchy silhouettes that allowed Ms. Minnelli — who has always considered herself a dancer first and foremost — to move freely, whether onstage or on the dance floor at Studio 54.</p><p>“He really invented me, along with Elsa,” Ms. Minnelli said. “He dressed me and she would dress the dress! It was wonderful what she did.”</p><p>“I think about Halston and Elsa inventing me,” she continued. “They said, ‘Be yourself!’ I thought, What the hell is that?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Minnelli wore silver bone cuffs designed by Ms. Peretti at a concert in New York in 1974.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">PL Gould/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Minnelli, wearing a bone cuff, with Jack Haley Jr., her second husband.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ron Galella Collection, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Minnelli said her signature look was also shaped by Christina Smith, the makeup artist who gave her the thick eyelashes that became a beauty hallmark. Ms. Minnelli found Ms. Smith through her work with Cher. “I’ve always loved Cher’s makeup,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Minnelli, who has scoliosis, said Halston helped her choose clothes that “focused on my face, and the line of my body.”</p><p>“The up and down of it all,” she added, kicking a shoeless foot ever so slightly up for emphasis. “He always thought in straight lines for me.”</p><p>Drawing an hourglass figure with her hands in the air, she said, “My body is the wrong shape for that!”</p><p>Ms. Minnelli’s father, whose director credits include the films “Meet Me in St. Louis” and “An American in Paris,” was a costume designer early in his career, and helped her cultivate an interest in fashion. “Whatever taste I got from my dad,” she said, adding that he approved of the image that Halston and Ms. Peretti helped create for her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“He loved it because of the simplicity and the style,” Ms. Minnelli said. “It was simple but so elegant, you know?”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Minnelli in Ms. Peretti’s bone cuffs and jug pendant.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erik Carter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Peretti is “one of those people who will always be with me,” Ms. Minnelli said, while patting the jug-shaped pendant on a necklace she was wearing — a design Ms. Peretti created for Halston before producing versions for Tiffany. Ms. Minnelli said that Halston, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/28/obituaries/halston-symbol-of-fashion-in-america-in-70-s-dies-at-57.html" title="">who died in 1990</a>, “used to put a little flower in it.”</p><p>The bone cuffs Ms. Minnelli was wearing in her apartment, she said, were the same ones she wore to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/30/archives/fashion-at-versailles-french-were-good-americans-were-great-caps.html" title="">Battle of Versailles</a>, a showcase of American and French fashion designers held at the Palace of Versailles in 1973.</p><p>They were also the same pair she wore to the Academy Awards in 2022, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/magazine/liza-minnelli-joni-mitchell-lady-gaga-bonnie-raitt.html" title="">she presented</a> the Best Picture award onstage in a wheelchair alongside Lady Gaga.</p><p>“If you put them on right, you have to follow your bone,” Ms. Minnelli said of the cuffs. The jewelry’s design is said to have been inspired by human bones that Ms. Peretti saw as a girl while visiting a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/travel/a-gothic-tour-of-italy.html" title="">crypt</a> in Rome.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Minnelli wore a yellow Halston dress when she won the Best Actress Oscar in 1973.
