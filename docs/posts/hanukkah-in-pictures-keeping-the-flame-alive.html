    <h1>Hanukkah in Pictures: Keeping the Flame Alive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hanukkah prayers commenced, the first candles were lit and the dreidels started spinning around sundown on Wednesday evening to commemorate the beginning of the Jewish festival of lights. The celebration will go on for eight nights as an affirming holiday observed wherever Jews make their home.</p><p>The holiday is deeply rooted in Jewish history, going back to 164 B.C.E. when a small militia of Jews called the Maccabees won a battle against the dominant Syrian-Greek military. After being driven out of parts of the land now called Israel, the Jews reclaimed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/world/middleeast/historical-certainty-proves-elusive-at-jerusalems-holiest-place.html" title="">Second Temple</a> in Jerusalem. It had been ransacked and there was only a tiny bit of oil to light the lamps. Miraculously, as tradition holds, the oil burned for eight days, a symbol to the Jews that they should continue their relationship with God while rebuilding their lives.</p><p>This year, Hanukkah began on the same night as Christmas. Many households celebrate both holidays, leading some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/us/christmas-hanukkah-chrismukkah.html" title="">to playfully refer to Wednesday as “Chrismukkah.”</a> For the second year, the holiday also came at a difficult time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">as Israel remains at war</a>.</p><p>During Hanukkah, Jews around the world light candles for eight consecutive nights. They pray, play games, sing, exchange gifts and spend time with family to commemorate the miracle that kept faith alive so many centuries ago.</p></div></div>
