Spunky and social, Gaia, a 130-pound spotted jaguar, did not shy away from the pickup trucks carrying tourists from a nearby ecolodge. She became a local celebrity among wildlife enthusiasts.</p><p>Then, this month, the flames arrived at breakneck speed. Gaia didn’t have time to flee.</p><p>The news jolted Mr. Figueiroa, who had monitored the jaguar and her siblings when they were still cubs. “That was one of the best sightings of my life,” he said, lifting a pant leg to reveal a tattoo of Gaia’s sister on his calf.</p><p>“When I saw Gaia burned, turned into coal, I could just imagine the pain she must have felt,” Mr. Figueiroa added. “It was a feeling of frustration and despair and helplessness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The fires have also killed at least three giant anteaters, mammals known for their distinctive long snout and two-foot-long tongue, which they use to scoop up insects.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A giant anteater in the Pantanal in 2017.

The flames are intensifying pressure on an ecosystem already stressed by unusually frequent fires in recent years, casting doubt on whether it can fully recover.</p><p>If it doesn’t, countless species may lose their last sanctuaries in South America, including the lowland tapir, according to Patricia Medici, a biologist and conservationist who studies the species. “In the Pantanal,” she explained, “the tapir is in paradise.”</p><p>For scientists like Dr. Leite, who have devoted much of their lives to safeguarding vulnerable wildlife in this region, the future looks bleak. She wonders, she said, whether the Pantanal, a rare bastion of nature where humans can still witness wildlife in abundance, will remain intact for the next generation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>“I don’t know whether my son will have the privilege to look a jaguar in the eye, like I have so many times,” Dr. Leite said, wiping away tears. “We’re losing this really magical place.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Lis Moriconi<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section></article></div>
