At a news conference two weeks later, President-elect Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-fight-biden-remote-work-deal-union-vows-fight-back" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">railed against</a> the deal and said he would go to court to undo it. “If people don’t come back to work, come back into the office,” he said, “they’re going to be dismissed.”</p><p>The back-and-forth previewed what is likely to be one of the earliest points of contention of Mr. Trump’s second administration. Over the past few years, many federal workers have organized their lives around hybrid arrangements that help them juggle work and family responsibilities, and have gone so far as to demand that the Biden administration preserve the status quo. Some have rushed to join the roughly <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one-quarter</a> to one-third of federal workers who are unionized, so that telework policies will be negotiable.</p><p>But to the president-elect and his allies, the work-from-home arrangements are not only a glaring example of liberal permissiveness run amok — “a gift to a union,” Mr. Trump said — but also a tantalizing opportunity to clear the federal government of obstructionist workers and to vastly shrink its reach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020?st=YNHNeR" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal column</a> in November, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the businessmen tapped to lead Mr. Trump’s government efficiency commission, said they would welcome “a wave of voluntary terminations” triggered by forcing federal employees to work from an office five days a week.</p><p>Many private-sector <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-asks-staff-return-office-five-days-week-march-memo-shows-2025-01-10/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employers</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/technology/amazon-return-to-office.html" title="">have recently</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/media/washington-post-return-to-office.html" title="">announced</a> such policies, arguing that in-person work improves communication, mentoring and collaboration.</p><p>The looming collision has heightened the tension across Washington as Mr. Trump heads into his second term. One government employee involved in a union campaign seeking to preserve work-from-home arrangements said union officials worried that, as with the Social Security Administration, press coverage of the effort would put a target on the agency involved and inspire the Trump administration to crack down.</p><p>“We are not ready to discuss all of this publicly just yet,” said a representative of the union, the National Treasury Employees Union.</p><p>Mr. Trump will not be the first president to chafe at his employees’ attachment to working from home. The Obama administration <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/23/presidential-memorandum-enhancing-workplace-flexibilities-and-work-life-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">adopted a policy</a> making it easier for federal employees to work remotely, but it could not envision the scale that would become common during the pandemic. By 2022, President Biden was seeking to dial it back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Biden proclaimed in that year’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/02/remarks-by-president-biden-in-state-of-the-union-address/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State of the Union address</a> that “the vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person,” and his administration <a href="https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/Policy%20Memo%20on%20Remote%20Work%20Variable%203-7-2023_508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/M-23-15.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">memos</a> laying out a new approach in 2023. Whatever the substantive merits, it surely wasn’t lost on Mr. Biden that Republicans had made a political issue out of “bubble bath bureaucrats” who lounged around their homes at taxpayer expense, as a <a href="https://www.ernst.senate.gov/news/press-releases/ernst-demands-bubble-bath-bureaucrats-get-back-to-work" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news release</a> from Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, put it.</p><p>But change was slow to come. A study of federal buildings <a href="https://www.pbrb.gov/files/2024/03/3.21.24-FINAL-PBRB-Interim-Report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that they were typically under one-third of their prepandemic occupancy in 2023. The White House chief of staff, Jeffrey D. Zients, repeatedly grumbled that “we don’t yet have the return-to-work levels that we should have,” as he said in an <a href="https://www.economicclub.org/sites/default/files/transcripts/economic_club_jeffrey_zients_0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">April 2024 interview</a>. About 15 to 20 percent of civilian federal workers are based in the Washington area.</p><p>Overall, Washington’s weekly occupancy rates were below average for 10 large metro areas last year, outpaced by places including New York and Chicago, according to data from Kastle, the building security firm. (Average occupancy across the 10 areas is still about half the prepandemic level, according to Kastle.)</p><p>Part of the explanation may be that Washington is politically liberal, even by the standards of a major American city — Vice President Kamala Harris won more than 90 percent of the vote there against Mr. Trump in November, versus about 82 percent in Manhattan and 77 percent in Chicago. It also skews <a href="https://www.houston.org/houston-data/median-age-metro-area" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">somewhat young</a>.

The testimonials align with a <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/60-million-fewer-commuting-hours-day-how-americans-use-time-saved-working-home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> in mid-2020 by the Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom and two colleagues, who found that the typical office worker saved about 80 minutes a day when working from home, about 40 percent of which was used to do more work. A recent Labor Department <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-13/remote-work-productivity.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> found that industries with higher rates of remote work had larger increases in productivity.</p><p>The determination to protect these work-from-home prerogatives has led to a series of standoffs between federal employees and their overseers during the final months of the Biden administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Lawyers in the Justice Department divisions that focus on civil rights and the environment sought to unionize last year to help preserve their remote-work arrangements and to protect themselves in case Mr. Trump follows through on his declared intention to revive <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> that would make it easier to fire civil servants.</p><p>The civil rights lawyers had to overcome opposition from their leadership, which initially argued that department lawyers were unable to form a union because of restrictions on workers involved in national security matters, according to <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/justice-department-lawyers-seek-to-lock-in-union-before-trump" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg Law</a>. They voted last week to unionize.</p><p>The Justice Department declined to comment.</p><p>Hundreds of employees at the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.nteu.org/media-center/news-releases/2024/09/26/ftcelection" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted in September to unionize</a>, partly because they hoped to protect their work-from-home arrangements under future administrations. But after quickly recognizing the union, the agency’s chair, Lina Khan, let months pass before engaging with it, according to a labor source familiar with the negotiation. Contract negotiations began in earnest only this week, according to the source, amid pressure from labor leaders and friendly politicians.</p><p>A person briefed on Ms. Khan’s thinking said that the agency received a concrete contract proposal only in mid-December and that it had to digest the details while <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filing cases and making orders final</a> before the administration ended.</p><p>Still, it is unclear how much the push by employees will help them.
