He had rented the truck to a 42-year-old Army veteran who then used it to ram into crowds on Bourbon Street, killing at least 15 people and injuring dozens more.</p><p>The truck’s owner, who did not want his name used, said that he had been renting five cars on Turo as a second income stream but that he did not plan to use the platform again after the attack. </p><p>In Las Vegas, the police said during a news conference that the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump Hotel’s lobby entrance, killing one and injuring at least seven others, was also rented from Turo. Officials called it a “coincidence” and said they were continuing to investigate any possible connections.</p><p>The company said in a statement that it was “actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.”</p><p>“We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,” the statement said. “We remain committed to maintaining the highest standards in risk management.”</p><p>The app, which began as a venture capital-backed startup in 2009, connects car owners with people looking to rent a car as an alternative to using a traditional rental company. The concept is similar to Airbnb, in that customers can rent a specific car make and model and coordinate pickup and drop-off with the car owner.</p><p>About 3.5 million people have booked a vehicle through Turo in the past year, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514587/000162828024047889/turoinc-sx1a12.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">company filing</a>. The filing from November said that about 150,000 people have rented out their cars during that period and that there were about 350,000 active vehicle listings in more than 16,000 cities as of September. Some car owners used the service to offset their car payments and costs while others rented out numerous cars as their primary income source. </p><p>The company had widely been expected to go public this year, and first filed paperwork for an initial public offering in 2022.</p><p>To book a car on Turo in the United States, you need to create an account with the company; provide a valid driver’s license, home address and payment card; and be at least 18 years old, <a href="https://help.turo.com/en_us/booking-a-car-H1gxVVeE9#:~:text=You%20must%20have%20a%20Turo,due%20for%20your%20booked%20trip." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the company’s website</a>. The company also said that additional information could be requested to verify an account or check a customer’s credit history, auto insurance score or criminal background, and that it can decline trips or remove users from the platform at its discretion.</p><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eli Tan is a reporter covering the technology industry and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eli-tan">More about Eli Tan</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
