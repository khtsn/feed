A large blue sky spread out behind the casse-croûte, built on a promontory over the Gulf of St. Lawrence.</p><p>“You can taste the sea,” Ms. Grasso said. “We are from Sicily, so we are used to good, fresh seafood.”</p><p>The most famous menu item of Quebec’s casse-croûtes<em> </em>— the dish of French fries layered with cheese curds and gravy known as poutine — has become known far beyond this French-speaking province’s borders, with restaurants <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bethpoutine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as far afield as Seoul</a> specializing in the dish.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But what about the funny-sounding pogo? Or a pinceau, sometimes spelled pinso? And the guédille, whose etymology remains obscure, even though it’s a staple of casse-croûtes?</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise, from top left; chicken poutine from Chez Cathy; a &#34;guédille,&#34; or lobster roll, from La Mollière; a shrimp &#34;guédille,&#34; or shrimp roll, from Chez Cathy, and a club sandwich with fries, a typical menu item from La Mollière.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Grasso, who now calls Montreal home, was mystified when she first encountered a guédille — a sandwich consisting of a split-top hot-dog bun stuffed with seafood salad, meat or whatever is handy — on a trip three years ago. She was immediately hooked.</p><p>Her mother also became a fan during a visit from Italy last year. “She wanted to go eat a guédille every day,” Ms. Grasso said.</p><p>Casse-croûtes can be found everywhere across Quebec, many open year round.</p><p>But in far-flung areas of the vast province — as in the small towns along the St. Lawrence River or on the Gaspé Peninsula some 600 miles northeast of Montreal — they are typically mom-and-pop operations that open and close with the seasons. The menus, displayed on the exterior walls, offer American-style fast food but with a French Canadian reinterpretation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Casse-croûtes are summer,” said Nicole Boulay, a local resident who was eating poutine at La Mollière, in Cap-des-Rosiers, a village that is part of the city of Gaspé. “Winters here are really long.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/00gaspe-dispatch-bkhz/00gaspe-dispatch-bkhz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/00gaspe-dispatch-bkhz/00gaspe-dispatch-bkhz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/00gaspe-dispatch-bkhz/00gaspe-dispatch-bkhz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="About 10 people waiting in line in the gravel parking lot of La Mollière.

They kept the establishment’s name, which referred to its old-fashioned ice cream.</p><p>“It’s not written the same way, but it’s also a reference to Molière,’’ Mr. Noël said of the 17th-century French playwright, adding, perhaps with an overabundance of caution of what customers can expect: “We have nothing to do with Molière.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The couple are hardly miserly in their use of local products. The strawberries and raspberries on their sundaes came from their gardens. Mr. Noël made sure to secure a steady supply of local shrimp, the small but tasty Nordic kind, whose population has dwindled with the St. Lawrence’s warming waters.</p><p>One winter, the couple came to install a new dishwasher in the shack. But a wall of snow in front blocked the entrance.</p><p>“We came back in the spring,” Ms. Grandmont said.</p><p>La Mollière stirs back to life in May. The owners spend the next five months in a trailer behind the casse-croûte, no days off.</p><p>Each casse-croûte boasts of, it seems, its own secret sauce, and the trailer is also where they safeguard the ingredients of their highly classified poutine sauce — a mix of barbecue sauce with ketchup, the recipe for which was handed down by his octogenarian grandfather.</p><p>“I prepare it in secret every morning,” Ms. Grandmont said. “I bring over the ingredients to the restaurant and then hide them back in the trailer. The recipe’s in my head.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Every casse-croûte purports to offer something unique, which is part of the restaurants’ charm, Mr. Noël said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Grandmont and Pascal Noël live in a trailer behind La Mollière, their casse-croûte, during the busy summer season.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The road to  La Mollière runs along the water, through the quaint village of Cap-des-Rosiers.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Casse-croûtes are “time travel machines’’ in the history of Quebec and the lives of its people, according to “<a href="https://www.editions-cardinal.ca/en/products/moutarde-chou" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moutarde Chou</a>,” a book on the establishments.</p><p>Quebec’s casse-croûtes first flourished amid the growing prosperity after World War II, said Gwenaëlle Reyt, an expert on the history of food in Quebec at the Université du Québec à Montréal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Casse-croûtes emerged with the boom in cars and tourism in Quebec,&#34; Ms. Reyt said.</p><p>Although casse-croûtes became a Quebec institution, the influence on them of American fast food and car culture was strong. Burgers and hot dogs became indispensable items.</p><p>“The casse-croûtes offered dishes that we never made at home,’’ said <a href="https://leseditionsgid.com/auteur/lambert-michel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michel Lambert</a>, an author of several books on the history of family cooking in Quebec who worked at a casse-croûte as a teenager in the 1950s. “That’s why they were considered exotic.”</p><p>Over the decades, dishes were reinvented and reimagined inside the modest shacks. Sometimes the transformations seemed more linguistic than culinary. Isn’t a pogo really a corn dog after all? And a <em>guédille au homard </em>is pretty similar to a Maine lobster roll, though it could be argued that the various mutations of the guédille have made it as Québécois as poutine.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Lambert researched the sandwich’s etymology.</p><p>“I never found the origins of the word guédille,” he said. “I don’t know whether it’s French or Indigenous. Maybe one day we’ll find a historical link to one man.”</p><p>At Chez Cathy, a casse-croûte in Rivière-au-Renard, another village in Gaspé city, you can get a pinso, a reinterpretation of the club sandwich. Instead of chicken, it contains ground beef patties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“It’s one of our popular items,’’ said Mario Noël, who along with his two sons owns Chez Cathy.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mario Noël, center, is the co-owner of Chez Cathy, along with his sons, Simon, left, and Jean-Michel.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Johanne Plourde, who worked at Chez Cathy when she was 12, receiving her poutine order outside the restaurant.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The casse-croûte began offering the sandwich under its longtime previous owner, whose daughter was named Cathy.</p><p>“Now many other places offer it,&#34; though elsewhere it was usually spelled “pinceau,” said Mr. Noël, who is not related to his namesake at La Mollière.</p><p>When Mr. Noël bought Chez Cathy in 2019, the deal included a secret sauce dating back to the 1960s, as well as the restaurant’s pinso and its top-selling guédilles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Chez Cathy’s poutine had a rocky start a couple of decades ago.</p><p>“In the beginning, they used Kraft cheese instead of cheese curds,’’ said Danielle Samuel, who has worked at Chez Cathy for 41 years. She shook her head.</p><p>By noon on most days, the parking lot at Chez Cathy is filled, but not all the customers were exiting their vehicles; it’s one of the few places that still serve customers by the side of their cars.</p><p>For the past nine seasons, Nathalie Dufresne has flitted from car to car, taking orders and returning with food on trays that are hung on the windows.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nathalie Dufresne, a waitress at Chez Cathy for nine years, serving a family of longtime customers in their car, using a tray that can be hung on their window.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Dufresne with customers outside Chez Cathy.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>“The locals stay in their cars, but the tourists get out and come order at the window,’’ Ms. Dufresne said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“A car!&#34; Ms. Samuel alerted Ms. Dufresne, spotting the day’s first customer, though it was still morning, as the waitress sprinted outside.</p><p>It was Dave Mainville’s day off from his job as an electromechanical technician, and he wanted to spoil himself by starting the day with his favorite, a poutine from Chez Cathy.
