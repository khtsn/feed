He told his lawyers that he did not want to subject his family to another round of humiliation after his wrenching gun trial in Delaware nearly three months ago.</p><p>The dramatic development signaled the final stages of a five-plus-year investigation into the period in which Biden was bankrolling his uncontrollable drug and alcohol addiction through lucrative overseas consulting contracts â€” while not paying his taxes.</p><p>The plea exposes Biden, 54, to an outcome that seemed unthinkable last year, when his lawyers were on the cusp of no-prison plea agreement: significant time behind bars. He now faces a maximum prison sentence of up to 17 years or a fine of up to $1.3 million, on top of the possible sentence of 25 years for federal gun charges on which a jury convicted him in June.</p><p>President Biden has the power to pardon people convicted of federal crimes. But as his son appeared in court today, the White House press secretary said that the president did not plan to pardon him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><hr/><p>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 2024</p><p><em>The presidential election is </em><strong><em>61 days away.</em></strong><em> Hereâ€™s the latest from the campaign trail.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump spoke at the Economic Club of New York today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A vigil for the victims of the school shooting in Winder, Ga.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amanda Kathleen Greene for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-47e6cb99">Investigators look for a motive in the Georgia school shooting</h2><p>The police found evidence that the 14-year-old student accused of opening fire yesterday at his Georgia high school and killing four people was interested in mass shootings.
