Trump.</p><p>The group, which is called RBG PAC and came into existence only days ago, began to spend $20 million on Friday in support of Mr. Trump, according to federal records. The group posted two abortion-<a href="https://x.com/RBG_PAC/status/1849805613863256379" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">themed</a> <a href="https://x.com/RBG_PAC/status/1849813170602508428" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ads</a> focused on Mr. Trump’s declaration that he would oppose a federal abortion ban.</p><p>The move is a brash one, because Mr. Trump deliberately appointed justices to overturn the federal right to abortion, and Justice Ginsburg openly despised the former president. “He is a faker,” she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/12/politics/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump-faker/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> during his 2016 run for president. “He has no consistency about him.” On Friday, her family rebuked Mr. Trump’s allies for invoking her name, calling the effort an affront to her legacy.</p><p>The group’s paperwork was signed by May Mailman, who worked in the Trump White House and who is now the director of the Independent Women’s Law Center. She did not respond to a request for comment Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Mailman posted the ads online and said they featured a “suburban mom” who had never voted for Trump before but was backing him now because he has said he opposes a national abortion ban.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/RBG_PAC/status/1849805613863256379" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The ad she posted</a> features a woman in a pink sweater sitting in a chair in a living room saying her life was better under Mr. Trump. She says that “freedom to choose is also important to me” and that she is voting for Mr. Trump, citing his support for exceptions to abortion restrictions in cases of rape, incest and risk to the life of the mother.</p><p>“His position is my position,” the woman says.</p><p>Mr. Trump has taken credit for overturning Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to states, many of which have banned the procedure.</p><p>He has since worked to improve his standing with voters on the abortion issue, which polls show remains a significant advantage for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>The RBG PAC’s website features two large pictures of Mr. Trump and Ms. Ginsburg and the words: “Great Minds Think Alike.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Clara Spera, the justice’s granddaughter and an abortion rights <a href="https://nwlc.org/staff/clara-spera/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawyer</a>, denounced the PAC in a statement to The New York Times on behalf of her family.</p><p>“The RBG PAC has no connection to the Ginsburg family and is an affront to my late grandmother’s legacy,” Ms. Spera said in the statement. “The use of her name and image to support Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, and specifically to suggest that she would approve of his position on abortion, is nothing short of appalling.”</p><p>Ms. Ginsburg’s dying wish in 2020 was that she not be replaced on the Supreme Court until a new president was installed, Ms. Spera <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/ruth-bader-ginsburg-s-dying-wish-not-have-donald-trump-n1240507" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said at the time</a>. Mr. Trump pushed ahead in the final weeks before losing re-election, appointing Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who voted with the majority to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p><p>“My grandmother was a champion for the equality of women and specifically tied the right to abortion to women’s freedom and ability to participate in society,” Ms. Spera said on Friday. “Meanwhile, Donald Trump gloats about his part in overturning Roe v Wade. He is a direct threat to reproductive liberty and equality.”</p><p>Justice Ginsburg opposed Mr. Trump so publicly that she got herself into hot water for it. “I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president,” she told The Times in a 2016 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-no-fan-of-donald-trump-critiques-latest-term.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FGinsburg%2C%20Ruth%20Bader&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics%C2%AEion=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0" title="">interview</a>. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Federal judges are expected to refrain from commenting on politics, and a few days later Justice Ginsburg <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/07/14/486012897/ginsburg-apologies-for-ill-advised-trump-comments" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apologized</a> publicly for what she called “ill-advised” comments. She was 83 years old, with a history of health problems, and later drew criticism from liberals who said she had overstayed her time on the court, setting the stage for Mr. Trump to replace her and help <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/us/supreme-court-dobbs-roe-abortion.html" title="">overturn</a> the federal right to abortion.</p><p>It is common at the end of a presidential campaign for so-called “pop-up” groups to begin spending large amounts of money after the last financial disclosure deadline. Any groups that were active by Oct. 16, the last day of the last filing period before Election Day, would have been required to disclose donors or vendors working with the group.</p><p>RBG PAC filed its paperwork on Oct. 16.</p><p>“While it is permissible to game the system in this way under the FEC reporting rules that were written in the 1970s, in my experience only a campaign that believes that it is losing resorts to this tactic,” said Brett Kappel, a Democratic campaign-finance lawyer at the firm Harmon Curran.</p><p>The amount of money that the super PAC is spending suggests that it took in considerable resources in just the last week. It reported $17.3 million in digital media spending, $1.6 million on text measures and $1 million for printing and postage.</p><p>There are a number of megadonors who have been pouring money into the 2024 race, none more so at this stage than Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and the co-founder of Tesla, who has spend $119 million as of mid-October.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>During an appearance on CNN this month, Ms. Mailman defended some of Mr. Musk’s tactics, including the offer to pay swing-state voters as much as $1 million to sign a petition. The Department of Justice has signaled that it could find Mr. Musk’s offer illegal, sending his super PAC a “warning letter” this week.</p><p>“There is something to super PACs using their money smarter and not just flooding the airwaves,” Ms. Mailman said on CNN.</p><p>She continued, “Getting people’s eyeballs, getting people to pay attention to this election is, I think, not just going to be the standard advertisements that we see. I think creativity is warranted in elections.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering campaign finance and the influence of billionaires in American politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/theodore-schleifer">More about Theodore Schleifer</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
