There has been <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2024/11/20/alem-de-fernanda-torres-confira-as-estrelas-com-fotos-mais-curtidas-em-ensaio-da-academia-do-oscar.ghtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intense online support</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ZAMENZA/status/1876142925224296762" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blanket media coverage</a> and <a href="https://x.com/LulaOficial/status/1894418488674193849" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screenings by the president</a>.</p><p>The result is a feeling of national pride more commonly reserved for the national soccer team. That is because, to many across this country of 200 million, Brazil’s first major Oscar would represent a meaningful validation of a culture that has long awaited its proper due.</p><p>“I know French culture, I know American culture, I know Russian culture, German culture, Italian culture, but they don’t know much about Brazilian culture,” Ms. Torres, 59, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCsMlmWO5oK" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a recent interview</a> that went viral in Brazil. “We lack this communication with the world, and on the other hand, Brazil feels sorry that the world doesn’t know what we know.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For generations, Brazil has given rise to a vast, vibrant tapestry of art, music, literature and film — some of it masterful and much of it deeply original — that has been widely celebrated inside this immense nation and hardly known outside it.</p><p>Yes, the Brazilian actress Carmen Miranda and her fruit hat became a Hollywood sensation in the 1940s — though in part by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/20/archives/pop-music-caricature-and-conqueror-pride-and-shame.html" title="">reinforcing Latino stereotypes</a> — and then Bossa Nova broke through in the 1950s. But since then, Brazilian culture has often been defined abroad by soccer, samba and Carnival — despite it being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/obituaries/clarice-lispector-overlooked.html" title="">much</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/arts/design/brazilian-artist-chico-exhibition.html" title="">much</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/arts/music/brazil-jazz-music.html" title="">more</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>One obstacle has been language. The Brazilian pop star <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/arts/music/anitta-versions-of-me.html" title="">Anitta</a> has recently begun reaching a broader audience, but only by singing in Spanish and English.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Brazil is continental in size, but we speak Portuguese, the language of a small country, a language barely recognized in the world,” Caetano Veloso, the Brazilian music legend, said in an interview.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso has been lauded as one of the greatest songwriters of this century.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pablo Porciuncula/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Veloso has created more beauty with that language than almost anyone. My colleague, the longtime New York Times music critic Jon Pareles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/29/movies/critic-s-notebook-a-global-heartbeat-on-cd-s.html" title="">has called</a> Mr. Veloso “one of the greatest songwriters of the century,” while David Byrne of Talking Heads <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/musica/noticia/2022/08/david-byrne-descrever-caetano-veloso-e-impossivel.ghtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said</a> of him: “When people ask me which musicians I admire, he is always first on the list.”</p><p>It seems then that another challenge has not been the quality of Brazil’s art, but its exposure.</p><p>Quentin Tarantino, Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese are all avowed fans of Brazilian cinema. Yet Mr. Scorsese said he had to discover it in a museum. He then became “obsessed,” he said, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1EMVVpUUuE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling</a> the 1969 Brazilian film “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_das_Mortes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Antonio das Mortes</a>” by Glauber Rocha “one of the high points of my film-going experience.”</p><p>Kurt Cobain and Beck said they were inspired by the Brazilian psychedelic rock band <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/arts/music/15roht.html" title="">Os Mutantes</a>. Paul Simon and Sting have praised the Brazilian singer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/arts/music/milton-nascimento-esperanza-spalding.html" title="">Milton Nascimento</a>. And Stevie Wonder is a fan and frequent collaborator with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/05/arts/pop-jazz-the-sophisticated-spontaneity-of-gilberto-gil.html" title="">Gilberto Gil</a>, whom these pages have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/arts/music/22gil.html" title="">called</a> “one of the world’s great songwriters.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stevie Wonder, right, and the Brazilian musician Gilberto Gil performing on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.

Mr. Eggers was stunned and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/rediscovering-one-of-the-wittiest-books-ever-written" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>: “It is a glittering masterwork and an unmitigated joy to read, but, for no good reason at all, almost no English speakers in the twenty-first century have read it.”</p><p>Well, it may not be a <em>good</em> reason, but the reality is that, for generations, the West has generally viewed the cultural output from poorer countries as less relevant or important.</p><p>That is in part why Brazilians have largely been relegated to the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/03/grammy-awards-rename-world-music-category-best-global" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">global music</a>” and Latin categories of the Grammys, and the foreign-language category of the Oscars.</p><p>This year has brought exceptions. At the Grammys, Mr. Nascimento was nominated for best jazz album with the American jazz musician Esperanza Spalding. Yet at the ceremony, organizers seated him far in the back while putting Ms. Spalding up front, prompting her to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hashtagpop/reel/DFmEgZ_xuZ6/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">protest</a>.</p><p>At the Oscars, Ms. Torres is the second Brazilian to ever receive a best acting nomination. The first? Her mother, 25 years ago. Fernanda Montenegro, Brazil’s most celebrated actress, was nominated in 1999 for her role in “Central Station,” a Brazilian film by Walter Salles, the same director behind “I’m Still Here.” She lost to Gwyneth Paltrow, a decision that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/movies/readers-oscar-snubs.html" title="">decried in Brazil to this day</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fernanda Montenegro, Brazil’s most celebrated actress and Ms. Torres’s mother, was nominated for best actress in 1999 for her role in “Central Station.’’ </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Now Brazil prays for redemption, including with the prize for best picture. It is only the second time a Latin American film has received the nomination, after the 2018 Mexican film “Roma,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/media/green-book-spike-lee-reaction.html" title="">which lost</a>.</p><p>The recognition “represents a lot for Brazil,” Mr. Veloso said. “We tend to exalt our country in songs, but we have a very large inferiority complex.”</p><p>Brazilians often call that phenomenon the “complexo de vira-lata,” roughly translated as the “mutt complex,” a term <a href="https://www.ufrgs.br/cdrom/rodrigues03/rodrigues3.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coined</a> in the 1950s by the Brazilian playwright <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/theater/theater-reawakening-the-giant-of-brazilian-theater.html" title="">Nelson Rodrigues</a>, originally referring to Brazil’s mixed-race identity and its tendency to view itself as inferior to richer nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“Perhaps because our European colonizers always saw us as an inferior people, this stigma has stuck to the country’s soul,” said Fernando Meirelles, director of the 2002 film “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/17/movies/film-review-boys-soldiering-in-an-army-of-crime.html" title="">City of God</a>,” one of the few other Brazilian movies to earn an Oscar nomination, including for best director. “To this day, we depend on external approval to deal with our low self-esteem.”</p><p>Even Ms. Torres admitted that she has internalized such views. When asked about her fellow nominees after her Golden Globe victory last month, <a href="https://youtu.be/Jft4LmbSiio?si=RhmnMJP6nHdvROGm&amp;t=57" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she responded</a>, laughing, “Everybody deserves it.
