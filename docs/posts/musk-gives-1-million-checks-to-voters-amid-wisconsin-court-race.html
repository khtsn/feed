A pastor prayed for him. A superfan begged him for a follow on X.</p><p>Elon Musk was the star of a 2,000-person rally on Sunday night in Wisconsin — ostensibly for the conservative candidate in a closely watched state judicial race — just 36 hours before polls open on Election Day. Of course he was.</p><p>The billionaire Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/elections/elon-musk-town-hall-pennsylvania.html" title="">looked very much like a candidate</a> at this rally, putting himself front and center in the final stretch of an election pitting two rivals against each other, neither of them named Elon Musk: Brad Schimel, the conservative in the race, and Susan Crawford, the liberal.</p><p>The closing moments of campaigns are highly choreographed. Mr. Musk’s visit to support Judge Schimel on the eve of the election was voluntary — Judge Schimel did not even attend the event. Mr. Musk appeared comfortable making himself the face of those closing arguments, and living with the results.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>No one forced Mr. Musk to visit the state, obviously. Despite entreaties from Wisconsin Republicans, President Trump declined to make a similar trip, perhaps sensing that the race is one conservatives are likelier to lose than to win, and that the most prominent booster could get tagged with blame.</p><p>Former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was among those hoping for a Trump visit. He said in an interview that he thought Mr. Musk was insulated to some extent from the politics of credit and finger-pointing.</p><p>“He doesn’t care,” Mr. Walker said. “It’s not like all these consultants on either side who don’t want to be pegged as losers.”</p><p>To hear Mr. Musk tell it, the stakes call for any and all interventions.</p><p>Weeks ago, Mr. Musk was only sporadically supportive of Judge Schimel, but his remarks about the race have turned existential. Mr. Musk and allied groups have spent over $20 million to support him, and he framed Tuesday’s election in nothing less than apocalyptic terms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wisconsin’s Supreme Court declined to stop Mr. Musk’s sweepstakes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“What’s happening on Tuesday is a vote for which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives — that is why it is so significant,” Mr. Musk said, referring to the key role that the court could play in congressional redistricting. “And whichever party controls the House to a significant degree controls the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization. I feel like this is one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At a highly produced town hall in Green Bay, already sporting more Packers paraphernalia than normal ahead of the city’s hosting of the N.F.L. draft next month, Mr. Musk pushed voter turnout. Republicans believe the key to victory revolves around turning out what Mr. Walker said were about 200,000 Trump voters who are unlikely to vote in an off-month and off-year election. Mr. Musk, despite any anger he stirs up among liberals, is popular among conservatives.</p><p>Some in the Green Bay crowd wore Musk paraphernalia and said they wanted an up-close look at someone they had followed for over a decade. “I’m here for Musk,” said Michael Labarbera, a 25-year-old who installs solar panels, in a DOGE hat he bought online. John Rosner, a retiree, sported a different Musk hat, bearing the Boring Company name, and said he was here “basically to meet Elon,” calling this moment “the closest I’ll ever get to him.”</p><p>Robert Cool, an 81-year-old retiree who was seated in an empty row to the side of the auditorium as he nursed an injury from a fall, said he had decided to make Mr. Musk’s event the first political rally he had attended in his life. A Trump rally, he said, “wasn’t as precise.”</p><p>“I wasn’t needed; this one, I felt, I need to be here,” said Mr. Cool, who has been bothered by the attacks on Tesla, which Mr. Musk himself complained about Sunday. “I support Musk more than I have anyone else in politics.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Musk is known for his belief in himself, and he plainly enjoys the encounters with voters who believe in him. To those in attendance, he is a hero even more so than the last time Mr. Musk was on a similar rock-star tour, in Pennsylvania all of five months ago.</p><p>This is the flip side to the blame game. Should Judge Schimel win, Mr. Musk’s activity will surely be given a tremendous amount of credit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Antonio Gracias, a close friend of Mr. Musk’s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Musk playing to the Green Bay crowd.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Other Republican groups that might be expected to spend money to support the conservative candidate kept to the sidelines. Mr. Musk’s super PAC has waged an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/us/politics/elon-musk-brad-schimel-wisconsin-state-supreme-court.html" title="">ambitious ground game</a>, and a nonprofit previously backed by Mr. Musk spent millions of dollars on television ads that it claims helped Mr. Schimel close the gap. Mr. Musk’s defenders like Mr. Walker believe that this race was made a winnable race only thanks to Mr. Musk’s spending.</p><p>Mr. Musk has also brought publicity. A million-dollar sweepstakes for signing a petition — and, for 12 hours, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/elon-musk-paying-voters-wisconsin.html" title="">questionable plan</a> to open the sweepstakes only to Wisconsin residents who had already voted — broke through the saturation of the news cycle in this state. (Just before the rally began, the state’s Supreme Court declined to halt the sweepstakes.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>And so, as he did in Pennsylvania during the general election last year, Mr. Musk on Sunday brought out oversize checks to hand out to winners. He trotted out one of his closest friends, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/elon-musk-antonio-gracias-social-security-administration.html" title="">Antonio Gracias</a>, to deliver a presentation on what Mr. Gracias called “outrageous” fraud in Social Security. And that was all after he took the stage donning a foam cheesehead hat before signing it and tossing it into the crowd.</p><p>The showman does all this even as he concedes that Judge Schimel may very well lose. As Mr. Musk wrapped up his remarks before beginning an extensive question-and-answer session, headgear was once again top of mind.</p><p>“We’ve got to pull a rabbit out of the hat — next level,” he said, retelling Judge Schimel’s standing in betting prediction markets. “We actually have to have a steady stream of rabbits out of the hat, like it’s an arc of rabbits flying through the air, and then landing in a voting booth.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering billionaires and their impact on the world.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Targeting Federal Agencies:</strong> The so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has appeared at agency after agency to slash spending and cut the federal work force. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/27/us/politics/doge-playbook-musk-cuts.html">Here’s how DOGE employees do it</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> The Trump administration detailed its plans to put the government’s main agency for distributing foreign aid fully under the State Department and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/usaid-trump-doge-cuts.html">reduce its staff to some 15 legally required positions</a>.
