The authorities barred many foreign journalists from coming to report on the flood’s aftermath last year. For the anniversary, however, they invited The New York Times and other news organizations to witness the reconstruction effort.</p><p>Now the bones of three new bridges rise from the dusty valley floor, the most visible fruits of a fast-paced, $2.1-billion reconstruction effort financed by one of Libya’s two <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/world/middleeast/libya-central-bank-political-stability.html" title="">rival government administrations</a>, and overseen by a warlord’s son.

The family who had only one tiny daughter survive, now living with her uncle. The family who had only one son survive, now living alone in the apartment.

Altogether, he said, they rescued 59 people from the waters.</p><p>But one person they did not save haunts him: a woman who managed to hand them her young twin boys but could not fit through herself. She begged them to take the boys and leave her. Then she was swept away.</p><p>From 3 to 5 a.m., the survivors on the rooftop prayed, watching the water rise.
