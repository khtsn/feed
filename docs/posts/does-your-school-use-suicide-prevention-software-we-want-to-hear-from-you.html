    <h1>Does Your School Use Suicide Prevention Software? We Want to Hear From You.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In response to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/well/mind/mental-health-young-adults-trends.html" title="">youth mental health crisis</a>, many school districts are investing in software that monitors what students type on their school devices, alerting counselors if a child appears to be contemplating suicide or self-harm.</p><p>Such tools — produced by companies like Gaggle, GoGuardian Beacon, Bark and Securly — can pick up what a child types into a Google search, or a school essay, or an email or text message to a friend. Some of these alerts may be false alarms, set off by innocuous research projects or offhand comments, but the most serious alerts may prompt calls to parents or even home visits by school staff members or law enforcement.</p><p>I write about mental health for The New York Times, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/social-media-brain-adolescents.html" title="">effects of social media use on children’s brains</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/health/suicide-predict-smartphone.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Ok4.mS0m.LdjHgwhp_Tws&amp;smid=url-share" title="">algorithms that predict who is at risk for suicide</a>. I’m interested in knowing more about how these monitoring tools are working in real life.</p><p>If you are a student, parent, teacher or school administrator, I’d like to hear about your experiences. Do you think these tools have saved lives? Do they help students who are anxious or depressed get the care they need? Are you concerned about students’ privacy? Is there any cost to false positives?</p></div></div>
