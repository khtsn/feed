The warrant issued on Tuesday only allowed investigators to detain him for questioning for a limited period of time; they need a separate warrant from a court to formally arrest him. But it is a sign that the authorities have grown impatient with Mr. Yoon’s refusal to answer questions about his actions, and could lead to a potential arrest and indictment. </p><p>It remained unclear how Mr. Yoon and his secrete service bodyguards would react to an attempt to detain him for questioning. There was no immediate comment from Mr. Yoon or his lawyers.</p><p>Mr. Yoon, who was impeached by parliament on Dec. 14, is the first sitting president of South Korea to face a criminal investigation. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The opposition has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-explained.html" title="">accused Mr. Yoon ​of committing insurrection</a> when he declared martial law on Dec. 3, and of sending troops to the National Assembly to try to block lawmakers from voting to overturn his move.</p><p>Images of soldiers with assault rifles streaming out of military helicopters and then trying to take over the National Assembly building caused widespread shock and outrage in South Korea, a country with a long history of political violence and military rule.</p><p>Lawmakers managed to gather and vote against martial law, forcing Mr. Yoon to rescind his order within hours. Despite the retreat, his failed maneuver has further emboldened the opposition, which pushed to impeach him, and infuriated a wide segment of South Koreans, who have marched in the tens of thousands against him.</p><p>With the support of his People Power Party, Mr. Yoon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeach.html" title="">survived an impeachment vote</a> in the National Assembly on Dec. 7. But a second vote a week later led to him being impeached after a dozen lawmakers from his own party sided with the opposition motion.</p><p>Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment.html" title="">a nonelected official</a> with no popular mandate, stepped in as interim leader, but then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/asia/south-korea-impeach-president-han.html" title="">was himself impeached</a> on Dec. 27 after a standoff with parliament over judicial appointments. Choi Sang-mok, the finance minister and deputy prime minister, is the current interim leader.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Yoon, who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-travel-ban.html" title="">barred from leaving the country</a>, could face the death penalty if he is convicted of insurrection and a court rules that he led it. His former defense minister has been arrested on charges of participating in an insurrection. The heads of the national police agency and the Seoul metropolitan police have also been detained for questioning on their roles during the martial law crisis.</p></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Turning Allies Into Enemies: </strong>The United States killed its own allies in Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/afghanistan-allies-enemies-nuristan-taliban.html">sabotaging itself in a part of the country</a> where it never needed to be.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Drives Both Sides in Sudan’s War: </strong>Famine and ethnic cleansing stalk Sudan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/africa/sudan-gold-rush-heart-civil-war.html">Yet the gold trade is booming</a>, enriching generals and propelling the fight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reining In Argentina’s Inflation: </strong>President Javier Milei has been praised inside and outside Argentina for taming the world’s highest inflation rate. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html">But his policies have inflicted widespread hardship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nudging Japan Forward: </strong>In a society used to quiet consensus-building, Tokyo has made bold changes to its defense policy.
