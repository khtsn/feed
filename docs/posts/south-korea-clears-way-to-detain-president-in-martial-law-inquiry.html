    <h1>South Korea Clears Way to Detain President in Martial Law Inquiry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The opposition has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-explained.html" title="">accused Mr. Yoon â€‹of committing insurrection</a> when he declared martial law on Dec. 3, and of sending troops to the National Assembly to try to block lawmakers from voting to overturn his move.</p><p>Images of soldiers with assault rifles streaming out of military helicopters and then trying to take over the National Assembly building caused widespread shock and outrage in South Korea, a country with a long history of political violence and military rule.</p><p>Lawmakers managed to gather and vote against martial law, forcing Mr. Yoon to rescind his order within hours. Despite the retreat, his failed maneuver has further emboldened the opposition, which pushed to impeach him, and infuriated a wide segment of South Koreans, who have marched in the tens of thousands against him.</p><p>With the support of his People Power Party, Mr. Yoon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeach.html" title="">survived an impeachment vote</a> in the National Assembly on Dec. 7. But a second vote a week later led to him being impeached after a dozen lawmakers from his own party sided with the opposition motion.</p><p>Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment.html" title="">a nonelected official</a> with no popular mandate, stepped in as interim leader, but then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/asia/south-korea-impeach-president-han.html" title="">was himself impeached</a> on Dec. 27 after a standoff with parliament over judicial appointments. Choi Sang-mok, the finance minister and deputy prime minister, is the current interim leader.</p></div></div>
