Trump said he would nominate Mr. Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. “We’ll just have to wait and see what happens,” she added.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has denied that he is against vaccination, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccines.html" title="">styling himself as a vaccine safety activist</a> who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/us/politics/rfk-jr-hhs-health-goals.html" title="">questions corporate influence</a> on science. His critics say he has promoted conspiratorial ideas about a public health intervention widely viewed as one of the most important advances in modern medicine.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has embraced the debunked theory that vaccines can cause autism and has questioned Covid-19 vaccines. He has also been linked to a measles outbreak in Samoa.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy visited a vaccine skeptic there in 2019, elevating anti-vaccination sentiment after the death of two infants who had received measles shots.
