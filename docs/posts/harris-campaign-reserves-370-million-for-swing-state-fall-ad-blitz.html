Just $170 million is being reserved so far on television, as traditional television audiences continue to fragment and shrink.</p><p>“This is a modern campaign in 2024 and we’re not just stuck in the times of old, where 80 percent of the budget has to be on television,” Quentin Fulks, Ms. Harris’s principal deputy campaign manager, said in an interview.</p><p>The Harris campaign did not say how much it would spend in each state. But it said its purchases of television advertising would total twice what President Biden’s 2020 campaign spent in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, four times what he spent in Georgia and six times what he spent in Nevada, the least populous of the battleground states.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Harris campaign is advertising now in seven swing states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — as part of a $150 million summer ad blitz. Mr. Fulks said advertising would continue in all of those states as well as nationally.</p><p>For now, Mr. Fulks said the campaign was focused on “aggressively defining” Ms. Harris in her early weeks as a presidential candidate.</p><p>“We have to make sure that voters know her, “ he said, “and at the same time, we have to make sure that we’re drawing a contrast with Trump.”</p><p>By booking early, the Harris team said it would be able to secure the best spots on the most viewed programs this fall, including college football, N.F.L., baseball, basketball and hockey broadcasts. In a memo, the campaign specifically listed ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Abbott Elementary” and the season premiere of “Golden Bachelorette,” as well as CBS’s “Survivor,” among the shows on which it was reserving ads.</p><p>The Harris campaign also said it would place ads on Fox News during the day, when the network has a “more moderate audience,” according to the memo, describing this as a strategy to reach supporters of former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, who was the runner-up in the Republican primary race, and “other conservative-leaning independents.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Former President Donald J. Trump’s campaign has so far reserved advertising past Labor Day in just two states, booking $44 million in television time in Pennsylvania and Georgia, according to AdImpact, the media tracking service. Mr. Trump had $327 million in the bank combined with the Republican Party and their shared accounts entering August, not far behind the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party’s combined $377 million, so much more advertising is expected.</p><p>“The fact that we are beating them to the punch is certainly an advantage,” said Rob Flaherty, Ms. Harris’s deputy campaign manager, citing both the pricing and availability of ads.</p><p>The initial Harris reservation emphasizes digital advertising far more than the Biden campaign’s first fall purchase did four years ago. Then, the Biden camp announced a $280 million initial reservation, with nearly 80 percent on television. Now, the Harris campaign is setting aside 46 percent of its initial reservation on traditional television and the majority on digital and streaming services.</p><p>Despite the focus on battleground states, the Harris team said it would also spend more than $10 million on national TV, as such ads can be booked to “play at the moments of highest viewership,” according to the memo.</p><p>Of course, the difference between digital and television is increasingly blurred as a growing number of Americans watch television programs through streaming platforms like Hulu, Roku, YouTube and Paramount+, all of which are part of the Harris digital reservation.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Harris campaign said its $200 million in digital bookings did not include a host of other online advertising, including through search and some social media and display ads.</p><p>The campaign’s ad blitz comes on top of $250 million in reservations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/us/politics/biden-tv-ads-super-pac.html" title="">previously announced by Future Forward</a>, the leading pro-Harris super PAC, which began buying time at the beginning of the year.</p><p>All told, that means that voters in the most contested states will be inundated with at least $620 million in pro-Harris and anti-Trump advertising from just those two groups over the final stretch of the campaign.</p><p>Television ads that are reserved in advance can be canceled, but campaigns are typically leery of doing so because it invites critical news coverage.</p></div></div></section><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-election-footer-carousel" data-id="100000009577677" data-source-id="100000009577677"><div>
