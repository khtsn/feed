The Israeli military warned Palestinians not to approach the sites or the adjacent roads, saying that they were considered “combat zones.”</p><p>The pause in operations came after days in which dozens of Palestinians trying to reach one of the foundation’s sites in the southern Gaza city of Rafah were killed after coming under fire, according to local health workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The circumstances of the episodes remain contested. On Tuesday, the Red Cross and Gaza health officials said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-site-shooting-israel.html" title="">at least 27 people had been killed</a> in the second large-scale deadly shooting in recent days. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said that a number of civilians had been injured and killed in an area outside the site but did not provide a number.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/statement/israel-and-occupied-territories-icrc-urges-civilian-protection-red-cross-field-hospital" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Red Cross</a>: “The majority of cases suffered gunshot wounds. Again, all responsive patients said they were trying to reach an assistance distribution site.”</p><p>The Israeli military said its forces had opened fire roughly a third of a mile from the distribution site after they identified “several suspects moving toward them” away from the Israeli-designated access route. After they failed to respond to warning shots, troops fired “near a few individual suspects,” the military said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began distributing aid in Gaza last week, but the rollout has been chaotic.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, later suggested that the casualty numbers from the incident were inflated but did not provide an alternate toll. He said the Israeli military was investigating.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-distribution-site-attack.html" title="">more than 20 Palestinians were killed</a> near an aid site, according to Gaza health officials. An Israeli military official said troops had fired “warning shots” toward Palestinians roughly a kilometer away, although the Israeli military formally denied shooting civilians “near or within” the site.</p><p>But the deadly episodes have further ensnarled the Israeli-backed aid effort, which has come under severe international criticism.</p><p>Hamish Falconer, a British Foreign Office minister responsible for the Middle East, called for an “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/gaza-minister-for-the-middle-east-statement-4-june-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immediate and independent investigation</a>” into the mass casualty events and criticized the new aid system. “Israel’s newly introduced measures for aid delivery are inhumane, foster desperation and endanger civilians,” he said in Parliament.</p><p>Hunger has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/middleeast/gaza-children-hunger.html" title="">widespread in Gaza</a> after an 80-day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">Israeli blockade on food</a>, fuel, medicine and other supplies. The Israeli government began relaxing those restrictions last month and allowed some aid to enter the enclave, much of which has been destroyed during the war.</p><p>Israel has said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid-plan.html" title="">new aid distribution system</a>, with sites in areas secured by Israeli troops and overseen mainly by U.S. contractors, would prevent the supplies from falling into the hands of Hamas. The United Nations, however, says there is no evidence that Hamas systematically diverted international aid under the previous U.N.-coordinated distribution framework.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The United Nations and other aid groups have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/middleeast/israel-un-aid-gaza.html" title="">boycotted the initiative</a> and have warned that it could endanger Palestinian civilians by forcing them to travel on foot through a war zone and past Israeli lines.</p><p>The rollout of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been chaotic. Its executive director <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/asia/gaza-aid-wood-independence-resigns.html" title="">resigned hours before the initiative</a> was set to begin operations, and Palestinians pushed through fences at one of the sites last week, prompting Israeli troops to fire warning shots.</p><p>Huge crowds of hungry Palestinians have been arriving early each morning at the aid sites, often walking for miles in the pre-dawn darkness. Palestinian witnesses have described a violent scramble for whatever boxes of food are available.</p><p>The foundation has pushed back against much of the criticism, arguing that Hamas is trying to undermine the initiative. In a statement on Tuesday, the foundation said that more than 100,000 boxes of food had been allocated at the sites.</p><p>The Israeli military has continued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-attack-gaza-hamas.html" title="">its offensive</a> against Hamas in Gaza. More than 90 people have been killed in the enclave over the past 24 hours, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Israeli leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, have threatened an immense escalation of the military campaign unless Hamas lays down its arms and releases the remaining hostages.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">war in Gaza</a> began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, which the Israeli authorities say killed roughly 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage to Gaza, mostly civilians. Israel’s subsequent campaign has killed more than 54,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
