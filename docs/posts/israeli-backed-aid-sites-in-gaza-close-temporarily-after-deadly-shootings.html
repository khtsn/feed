The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said that a number of civilians had been injured and killed in an area outside the site but did not provide a number.</p><p>According to the Red Cross: “The majority of cases suffered gunshot wounds. Again, all responsive patients said they were trying to reach an assistance distribution site.”</p><p>The Israeli military said its forces had opened fire roughly a third of a mile from the distribution site after they identified “several suspects moving toward them” away from the Israeli-designated access route. After they failed to respond to warning shots, troops fired “near a few individual suspects,” the military said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began distributing aid in Gaza last week, but the rollout has been chaotic.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, later suggested that the casualty numbers from the incident were inflated but did not provide an alternate toll.

The Israeli government began relaxing those restrictions last month and allowed some aid to enter the enclave, much of which has been destroyed during the war.</p><p>Israel has said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid-plan.html" title="">new aid distribution system</a>, with sites located in areas secured by Israeli troops and overseen mainly by U.S. contractors, would prevent the supplies from falling into the hands of Hamas. The United Nations, however, says there is no evidence that Hamas systematically diverted international aid under the previous U.N.-coordinated distribution program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The United Nations and other aid groups have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/middleeast/israel-un-aid-gaza.html" title="">boycotted the initiative</a> and have warned that it could endanger Palestinian civilians by forcing them to travel on foot through a war zone and past Israeli lines.</p><p>The rollout of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been chaotic. Its executive director <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/asia/gaza-aid-wood-independence-resigns.html" title="">resigned hours before the initiative</a> was set to begin operations, and Palestinians pushed through fences at one of the sites last week, prompting Israeli troops to fire warning shots.</p><p>Huge crowds of hungry Palestinians have been arriving early each morning at the aid sites, often walking for miles in the pre-dawn darkness. Palestinian witnesses have described a violent scramble for whatever boxes of food are available.</p><p>The foundation has pushed back against much of the criticism, arguing that Hamas is trying to undermine the initiative. In a statement on Tuesday, the foundation said that more than 100,000 boxes of food had been allocated at the sites.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
