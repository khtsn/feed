The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which comprises the eurozone’s largest listed companies, was up more than 1 percent in morning trading. Shares in Britain, Germany and France all broadly gained.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan nudged higher. Those indices were seen as among the most exposed if President Trump broadened tariffs on longstanding trading partners. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, a market that had been a bright spot in Asia, fell nearly 1 percent — a fourth straight day of decline.</p><p>As stock markets seemed to regain their footing on Wednesday, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/eu-us-trump-tariffs.html?smid=url-share" title="">European Union said it was implementing tariffs</a> in retaliation to Mr. Trump’s 25 percent duty on steel and aluminum imports, which went into effect earlier in the day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The European Commission called the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum “unjustified.” It said it would impose levies on a wide range of American goods that would take effect on April 1. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said the tariffs were nearly equal in value to the metals duties being applied by the Trump administration.</p><p>The rise in stock prices reversed some of losses from earlier in the week and followed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/stock-markets-trump.html" title="">another turbulent trading day</a> on Wall Street, after the White House introduced and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/11/us/trump-news" title="">rolled back</a> new tariffs. The whipsaw on tariffs has added to investors’ confusion over the Trump administration’s economic policy.</p><p>Recent waves of selling have left the S&amp;P 500 index nearly 10 percent below its mid-February record. Falling more than 10 percent would signify a symbolic milestone known on Wall Street as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/stock-market-correction.html" title="">correction</a>.</p><p>“Uncertainty breeds volatility,” said Alan McKnight, chief investment officer at Regions Bank. “Right now the level of uncertainty continues to ratchet up.”</p><p>The CBOE’s Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has risen in recent days, a sign of investor jitters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Investors are having a tough time discerning what they should expect on a go forward basis,” Mr. McKnight said. “It’s not just about it being good or bad. It’s about getting some clarity.”</p><p>The volatility is extending to how foreign investors are moving money in and out of markets in Asia. Khoon Goh, head of Asia Research at Australian bank ANZ, said foreign investors are turning “cautious” because of uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policy.</p><p>“Rising investor concerns over the impact of tariffs on U.S. growth is spilling over into Asian equities,” Mr. Goh wrote in a report.</p><p>Shares in Australia fell for a second straight day after the White House<span>  </span>ruled out any exceptions or exemptions on its steel and aluminum tariffs. Last month, Mr. Trump said he would give “great consideration” to exempting Australia because it buys more goods from the United States than it sells. During Mr. Trump’s first term, he exempted Australia from steel and aluminum tariffs.</p><p>Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, said he would not impose reciprocal tariffs because they would only hurt Australian consumers by pushing up prices. But he condemned tariffs as an economic policy, calling them “a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Daisuke Wakabayashi is an Asia business correspondent for The Times based in Seoul, covering economic, corporate and geopolitical stories from the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/daisuke-wakabayashi">More about Daisuke Wakabayashi</a></span></p></div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>No Exemptions for Japan:</strong> Japanese officials visiting Washington <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/japan-trump-tariffs-auto-steel-trade.html">failed to win assurances</a> that the country would be exempt from sweeping tariffs set to hit imports of metals and cars into the United States.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump Has Said ‘No Exceptions’</strong><strong>:</strong> His administration has acknowledged that exceptions undercut the power of tariffs, but it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/economy/trump-tariffs-exceptions.html">seems hard for the president to resist making deals</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eager for Tariffs:</strong> Many companies oppose President Trump’s tariffs, but some U.S industries like steel and aluminum makers say <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/economy/trump-tariff-supporters.html">they would welcome the help</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Possibility of a Recession:</strong> President Trump declined in an interview to rule out the possibility that his economic policies, including a dizzying approach to tariffs, would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/trump-recession-lutnick.html">cause a recession</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
