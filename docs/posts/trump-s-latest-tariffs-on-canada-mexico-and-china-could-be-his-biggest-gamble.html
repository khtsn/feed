On Tuesday, he cited Canada’s hostility toward American banks as another reason.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said it was difficult to understand Mr. Trump’s rationale for the tariffs but posited that his intent was to cripple Canada. “What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that’ll make it easier to annex us,” Mr. Trudeau said during a news conference on Tuesday. “That’s never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said Tuesday afternoon that the president might reach some sort of accommodation with Canada and Mexico and announce it on Wednesday. “I think he’s going to figure out, you do more, and I’ll meet you in the middle some way,” Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>Canada announced a series of retaliatory tariffs on $20.5 billion worth of American imports, and Mr. Trudeau said that other “non-tariff” measures were forthcoming.</p><p>“Yeah, he can do damage to the Canadian economy but he is going to rapidly find out, as American families are going to rapidly find out, it’s going to hurt people on both sides of the border,” Mr. Trudeau said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We will never be the 51st state,” Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said Tuesday in announcing that his country would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Stock markets around the world slumped. In the United States, the financial sector was one of the worst hit, alongside a host of companies, including cruise lines and big tech firms. The S&amp;P 500 fell as much as 2 percent before moderating losses in the afternoon. The dip added to Monday’s 1.8 percent loss, which was its sharpest decline this year.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The bet that Mr. Trump appears to be making is that America is so economically strong and critical to international commerce that he can deploy tariffs as a cudgel to solve nearly every problem. But Mr. Trump’s blend of mercantilism and bullying tactics risks destabilizing a U.S. economy that has been battered by three years of inflation and now faces slowing growth.</p><p>The president is imposing steep import taxes on America’s largest trading partners at a moment when inflation has yet to come fully under control, a decision that many economists say will further raise costs for American households and hinder economic growth.</p><p>“The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy,” said Michael Hanson, senior executive vice president of public affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy.”</p><p>Anxious business groups were holding emergency meetings on Tuesday to determine their responses to the trade moves, which impose a 25 percent tariff on products from Canada and Mexico, and add another 10 percent tariff to previous levies on China. Some groups were considering taking legal action to challenge the national security authority that the Trump administration is invoking to enact the tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A farm outside Dannebrog, Neb.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tim Gruber for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Others were trying to grapple with what they would mean for their bottom lines. The retailer Target warned on Tuesday that tariffs could hurt its effort to recover from a tough 2024, saying that consumers could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/target-earnings-holiday-sales.html" title="">pull back on spending</a> amid wider uncertainty about the economy and that the company could raise prices for some products as early as this week. The chief executive of Best Buy, Corie Barry, said on a conference call that price increases were “highly likely,” but that it was difficult to say how big they would be.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, estimated that if the tariffs were maintained and retaliation continued, economic growth would be a full percentage point lower than it would otherwise have been. That would suggest the U.S. economy would grow only 1 percent in 2025. In 2024, it grew 2.5 percent.</p><p>Ms. Bostjancic also estimated that the tariffs could prompt price hikes on everyday items that would cost households an additional $1,000 a year, on average.</p><p>Some businesses and unions that would benefit from the tariffs praised them. The United Auto Workers union said that they were “glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class.”</p><p>And Mr. Trump showed no signs of backing down on Tuesday, saying companies could simply avoid the tariffs if they built their factories in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“IF COMPANIES MOVE TO THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE NOT TARIFFS!!!” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>New cars await transport at the Port of Baltimore.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Hours later, Mr. Trump warned that if Canada retaliated with its own higher tariffs, the United States would increase its “reciprocal” tariff by the same amount.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s top economic aides tried to explain the decision on Tuesday. Mr. Lutnick said on CNBC that the tariffs were “not a trade war,” calling the conflict a “drug war” instead.</p><p>If Canada and Mexico can prove to the president that they can stop the flow of fentanyl, “then of course the president can remove these tariffs,” the commerce secretary said. But he said the United States had not seen a “statistically relevant reduction of deaths in America.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Official statistics show that U.S. overdose deaths <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-reports-decline-in-us-drug-overdose-deaths.html#:~:text=CDC%20Reports%20Nearly%2024%25%20Decline%20in%20U.S.%20Drug%20Overdose%20Deaths,-Release&amp;text=This%20is%20the%20most%20recent,around%20114%2C000%20the%20previous%20year" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have declined significantly</a> over the 12 months ending in September, and crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/americas/mexico-border-migration-trump-tariffs-deadline.html" title="">have plummeted</a>.</p><p>Mr. Lutnick said the president would be taking other trade-related actions against Canada and Mexico in April. “Canada and Mexico had an invitation to trade with an amazing economy, the United States of America, and they have abused that invitation,” Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>Everett Eissenstat, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs and a former economic adviser to Mr. Trump, said the president appeared dissatisfied with other countries’ progress on combating drug trafficking, but said he might have other aims.</p><p>“I think it is about the fentanyl, but it’s about a broader picture too,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau, along with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, implied the administration was creating a false pretext for tariffs.</p><p>After ticking off a list of Mexico’s recent successes in cracking down on drug trafficking, Ms. Sheinbaum rejected what she called the “fentanyl argument” invoked by Mr. Trump to justify the imposition of the tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“For humanitarian reasons, we cooperate to prevent the illegal trafficking of drugs into the United States,” she said in a statement. “However, as we have stated on many occasions, the government of that country must also take responsibility for the opioid crisis that has caused so many deaths in the United States.”</p><p>Mr. Trudeau called Mr. Trump’s rationale “completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false.”</p><p>One of Mr. Trump’s primary goals for tariffs is to force more domestic manufacturing. He also views trade deficits as American “subsidies” to other countries and believes that tariffs can help offset the cost of tax cuts and help pay down the $36 trillion national debt.</p><p>Tariffs are likely to encourage some companies to open factories in the United States, to serve American customers. But Canada, Mexico and China have also announced plans to retaliate against U.S. exports, hitting a broad swath of American sectors, including agriculture, retail and automobiles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The United States “must also take responsibility for the opioid crisis” that has caused so many American deaths, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said Tuesday in a statement. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Raquel Cunha/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The economic impact of tariffs depends largely on how global trade shifts to account for the increased costs and how consumers adapt. Citing the diversion of trade to Vietnam and Mexico during Mr. Trump’s trade war in his first administration, economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics predict these tariffs will lead to a decline in the share of U.S. imports from Mexico to 13 percent, a drop of 2 percentage points. They also expect U.S. imports from Canada to fall to 10 percent.</p><p>John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, warned on Tuesday that tariffs would likely lead to higher U.S. prices but that the magnitude was highly uncertain.</p><p>Speaking at an event hosted by Bloomberg, he said he was starting to factor in the impact of tariffs on inflation “because I think we will see some of those effects later this year.”</p><p>Mr. Williams stressed that the Fed was also paying close attention to how tariffs would affect economic activity, including if businesses continue to invest or if consumers continue to spend. “That’s where I think another big uncertainty is,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump is likely correct in his calculation that tariffs will hurt America’s trading partners more than the United States. Because the United States is such a big country with diverse resources, it is far less dependent on trade than many other advanced economies. The tariffs could also strengthen the U.S. dollar, which is the world’s reserve currency, making imports seem cheaper and blunting some of the impact of the levies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Trade in goods and services accounts for about a quarter of U.S. economic activity, compared with roughly 70 percent for Mexico and Canada and 37 percent for China. Canada and Mexico both send about 80 percent of their exports to the United States, making them extremely dependent on the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A new home under construction in Georgia last fall.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Foreign governments have already reacted to the threat of Mr. Trump’s tariffs by quietly working to diversify their trade relationships, seeking out partners other than the United States. Mexico has <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/eu-and-mexico-seal-updated-trade-deal/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">updated its trade agreement</a> with the European Union and pushed forward in trade talks with Brazil. Europe reached a separate agreement with South American countries and with Switzerland.</p><p>Still, the negative impacts of tariffs are likely unavoidable, particularly for Canada and Mexico. An <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/us-tariffs-canada-and-mexico-would-hurt-all-three-economies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics</a> in February found that a 25 percent tariff on all U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico, matched by similar tariffs from those countries, would cause the U.S. economy to shrink in the coming years, though the Canadian and Mexican economies would shrink more.</p><p>The tariffs drew a quick condemnation from Democrats in Congress while Republicans strained to defend them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said Mr. Trump’s tariffs were “oriented around specific objectives, in this case, to reduce the amount of fentanyl coming in this country, across our borders. And so these tariffs, I think, are hopefully temporary.”</p><p>“Hopefully, when it’s all said and done, it won’t be something that will create a lot of disruption,” he said.</p><p>Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, also said he hoped that the tariffs wouldn’t persist for an extended period of time.</p><p>“Texas does an enormous amount of trade with both Mexico and Canada,” Mr. Cruz said. “So my hope is these tariffs act as the incentive that President Trump said they were designed to be.”</p><p>Colby Smith<!-- -->, Joe Rennison and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter, based in Washington.
