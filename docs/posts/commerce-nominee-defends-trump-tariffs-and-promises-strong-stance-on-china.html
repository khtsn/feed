    <h1>Commerce Nominee Defends Trump Tariffs and Promises Strong Stance on China</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But Democrats view Mr. Lutnick’s financial ties with more skepticism, saying they could raise questions about his ability to put the interests of the American people ahead of those of himself and former business partners.</p><p>In a letter addressed to Mr. Lutnick Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, criticized Cantor Fitzgerald’s investments into a cryptocurrency company called Tether. She called Tether “a known facilitator of criminal activity that has been described as ‘outlaws’ favorite cryptocurrency,’” saying that the tool had financed Mexican drug cartels, terrorist groups and the North Korean nuclear weapons program.</p><p>The connections with tether “raise significant questions about your own personal judgment and the conflicts of interest that you will have if you are confirmed as Commerce Secretary,” Ms. Warren wrote to Mr. Lutnick.</p><p>As the head of the Commerce Department, Mr. Lutnick would be in charge of many government functions that have enormous sway over the business sector. The Commerce Department is in charge of promoting business interests abroad, restricting the technology sector to protect national security, and delivering government subsidies to the semiconductor and broadband industries, among other functions.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also said that Mr. Lutnick would lead the administration’s trade policy more broadly, including overseeing the United States Trade Representative, a small agency that negotiates trade deals and reports directly to the president.</p></div></div>
