The work was broadly applicable to a wide range of treatments for other illnesses, from Covid drugs to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/snakes-universal-antivenom-tim-friede.html" title="">snake antivenom</a> and therapies for <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250501-mravic-hiv-antibodies.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">autoimmune diseases</a>.</p><p>“The consortia for H.I.V./AIDS vaccine development and immunology was reviewed by N.I.H. leadership, which does not support it moving forward,” said a senior official at the agency who was not authorized to speak on the matter and asked not to be identified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“N.I.H. expects to be shifting its focus toward using currently available approaches to eliminate H.I.V./AIDS,” the official said.</p><p>The program’s elimination is the latest in a series of cuts to H.I.V.-related initiatives, and to prevention of the disease in particular. Separately, the N.I.H. also paused funding for a clinical trial of an H.I.V. vaccine made by Moderna.</p><p>“I find it very disappointing that, at this critical juncture, the funding for highly successful H.I.V. vaccine research programs should be pulled,” said Dennis Burton, an immunologist who led the program at Scripps.</p><p>The cuts will derail hard-won progress against H.I.V. over the past few decades, public health experts said.<span>  </span>This week, the administration also withheld funds that were due to states and territories for H.I.V. prevention work. In Texas, the State Department of Health Services asked<span>  </span>grantees to pause all activities “until further notice.” In Mecklenberg County in North Carolina, the health department has already had to lay off 10 staffers. Already, many African countries have reported serious disruptions in their efforts to curb the epidemic. </p><p>“It’s just inconceivable how shortsighted this is,” said Mitchell Warren, executive director of the H.I.V. prevention organization AVAC.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The number of new H.I.V. infections had been declining steadily since 2010. Still, in 2023, the World Health Organization reported 1.3 million new cases, including about 120,000 children.</p><p>“The H.I.V. pandemic will never be ended without a vaccine, so killing research on one will end up killing people,” said John Moore, an H.I.V. researcher at Weill Cornell Medical in New York.</p><p>“The N.I.H.’s multiyear investment in advanced vaccine technologies shouldn’t be abandoned on a whim like this,” he said.</p><p>In his first term, President Trump embraced initiatives to end the H.I.V. epidemic in the United States. But his second administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/health/cdc-hiv-prevention-treatment.html" title="">slashed</a> federal support of such efforts. The N.I.H. terminated several grants related to PrEP, the regimen of preventive drugs that are highly effective in thwarting H.I.V. infection.</p><p>The Trump administration also shut down the H.I.V. prevention division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provided funds to states and territories for H.I.V. prevention and for detecting and responding to H.I.V. outbreaks. Officials at the health department have said some of the work will be shifted to the yet to be formed federal Administration for a Healthy America, but no details have been provided.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the C.D.C., N.I.H. and other federal health agencies, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In January, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/health/cdc-hiv-prevention-treatment.html" title="">halted disbursement</a> of funds from the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as Pepfar, a $7.5 billion program that supplied most of the treatment for H.I.V. in Africa and developing countries worldwide.</p><p>The State Department later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/health/trump-usaid-pepfar.html" title="">issued waivers</a> to allow treatments to resume but did not restore funding for H.I.V. prevention.</p><p>Trial after trial has failed to produce an H.I.V. vaccine, leading some experts to question whether it is possible to design a traditional vaccine at all against the wily virus. The Scripps and Duke teams had taken a different tack, studying the body’s immune response to the virus.</p><p>With funding from <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2019/20190710-burton-nih-award-new-hiv-vaccination.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven-year awards</a> made <a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/duke-institute-awarded-129-million-grant-ongoing-quest-hiv-vaccine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 2019</a>, they focused on so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies, which have been shown in animal studies to provide long-lasting protection against exposure to multiple H.I.V. strains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-clinical-trial-three-mrna-hiv-vaccines" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clinical trials based on their work</a> may continue, as long as N.I.H. funding for the H.I.V. Vaccine Trial Network is maintained.</p><p>But ending the research programs now means that in a few years, there will be no new candidates in trials, Mr. Warren said.</p><p>“Almost everything in the field is hinged on work that those two programs are doing,” he said. “The pipeline just got clogged.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Apoorva Mandavilli reports on science and global health for The Times, with a focus on infectious diseases and pandemics and the public health agencies that try to manage them.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
