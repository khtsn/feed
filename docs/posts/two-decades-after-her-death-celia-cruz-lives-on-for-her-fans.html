I don’t want them thinking about when there’s not any money, or when there’s fighting at home. My message is always ‘felicidad’ — happiness.”</p><p>Ms. Cruz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/17/arts/celia-cruz-petite-powerhouse-of-latin-music-dies-at-77.html" title="">died in 2003 at her longtime home in Fort Lee, N.J., from complications after a surgery</a> for a brain tumor. She was 77. Following a tour of her coffin in Miami, masses of fans honored her at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/21/nyregion/salsa-fans-ache-to-say-farewell-to-their-queen-celia-cruz.html" title="">public viewing in New York City</a>.</p><p>More than two decades later, her message still resonates, and she remains relevant in what would have been her birth’s centennial this year. She has remained specially visible in Miami, where many Cuban exiles and their children revere her, and the sound of bongo drums are heard in private and public celebrations.</p><p>“I see Celia Cruz not only as a legendary performer but as an enduring symbol of cultural memory, resilience and diasporic pride,” Karen S. Veloz, a Cuban American music professor at Florida International University in Miami, said in an interview. “She stands as a cultural icon whose music traverses generations, political borders and languages.”</p><p>And beyond Miami, Ms. Cruz has maintained a digital audience too, with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2weA6hhVqTIN2gSn9PUB9U?si=8euZevsGTZCEghWrHaMf3A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 6 million monthly listeners</a> on Spotify and her official YouTube channel garnering <a href="https://youtube.com/@celiacruzofficial?si=ztFYmIennXBp4oyo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 493,000 subscribers</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Here are some of the different ways that the grande dame of salsa, also referred to simply as Celia by her fans, has been honored recently.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-61df6c2b">The Celia Bobblehead</h2><p>For a home baseball game on May 14, the Miami Marlins <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1216834006476006&amp;set=pcb.1216834729809267" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gave away 8,000 bobbleheads</a> of Celia Cruz as part of the organization’s annual Cuban Heritage Day.
