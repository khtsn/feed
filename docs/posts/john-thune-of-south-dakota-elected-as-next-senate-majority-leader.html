Trump’s Make America Great Again movement.</p><p>In a closed-door vote conducted by secret ballot, Mr. Thune emerged victorious by a vote of 29 to 24 over Senator John Cornyn of Texas, another well-respected establishment Republican, according to two people familiar with the vote. Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who pitched himself as the Trump candidate in the race and had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-senate-thune-scott.html" title="">supported by right-wing allies of the president-elect</a>, was forced out of the contest in an earlier round of voting after drawing just 13 supporters, well behind Mr. Thune and Mr. Cornyn, they said.</p><p>The switch in leadership represents a remarkable moment in the Senate, where Mr. McConnell has held on to power for 18 years nearly without challenge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I am extremely honored to have earned the support of my colleagues to lead the Senate in the 119th Congress, and I am beyond proud of the work we have done to secure our majority and the White House,” Mr. Thune said after being elected. “This Republican team is united behind President Trump’s agenda, and our work starts today.”</p><p>Just five Republican senators besides Mr. Thune and Mr. Cornyn came to the Senate before Mr. McConnell took charge in 2007, and only a handful of Democrats have served in a Senate where Mr. McConnell was not either majority or minority leader. Mr. McConnell played his strategic cards close to his chest and sought to push his conference in his direction. That leadership style is sure to change.</p><p>Mr. Thune made his case <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-john-thune-modern-republican-party-our-mandate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an opinion essay on Fox News</a> on Monday, arguing that Senate Republicans needed to fulfill Mr. Trump’s promises to voters in order to keep the support of a multiethnic, multiracial coalition that swept him into a second term.</p><p>“If we fail to deliver on President Trump’s priorities, we will lose their support,” he wrote. “They have trusted us with their votes. Now we have to roll up our sleeves and get to work.”</p><p>He also pitched colleagues on his plans to open up the Senate floor to more debate and amendments and said he would meet regularly with Speaker Mike Johnson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The former president <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1341547750710800385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1341547750710800385%7Ctwgr%5Ebadc6b94d5731243eda2cbd154af36473df675a5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftalkingpointsmemo.com%2Fnews%2Ftrump-attacks-mitchs-boy-sen-thune-for-pooh-poohing-electoral-college-challenge" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has railed against Mr. Thune in the past</a> over his refusal to go along with Mr. Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>But Mr. Thune has worked to improve his rapport with the president-elect. He visited Mar-a-Lago in the spring and spoke with Mr. Trump just days ago.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Carl Hulse is the chief Washington correspondent, primarily writing about Congress and national political races and issues.
