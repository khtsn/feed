    <h1>Officials Resigned After Refusing to Drop Adams Case</h1>

Soon after, when the department sought to transfer the case to the public integrity unit in Washington, the two men who led that division also quit.</p><p>Danielle Sassoon, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, wrote in her resignation letter that the order from Emil Bove, the acting No. 2 official at the Justice Department, was “inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor.” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/13/us/letter-to-bondi.html" title="">You can read her full letter</a>.)</p><p>The resignations represent the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-charges-doj-trump.html" title="">most high-profile public resistance so far to President Trump’s tightening control over the Justice Department</a>. They were a stunning repudiation of the administration’s attempt to end the prosecution of Adams, who has recently sought to curry favor with the president.</p><p>Just three days ago, Bove — who until recently was a criminal defense attorney for Trump — ordered the Manhattan office to drop the charges against Adams, arguing that it was stopping the mayor from helping Trump crack down on immigration. He made clear that he believed Trump should hold sway over the Justice Department, which for decades has operated separately from the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Bove accepted Sassoon’s resignation in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/13/nyregion/memo-from-bove-1.html" title="">his own eight-page letter</a>, in which he blasted her handling of the case. He also told Sassoon that the attorney general and the Justice Department’s internal investigative arm would evaluate her conduct.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump at the Oval Office today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-29435e8c">Trump plans to upend trade with ‘reciprocal’ tariffs</h2><p>President Trump ordered his advisers this afternoon to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-tariffs.html" title="">devise broad new tariffs on American trading partners around the globe</a>. He described them as necessary to end “unfair” trading relationships and stop other countries from taking advantage of the U.S. market.</p><p>Howard Lutnick, the president’s nominee for commerce secretary, said the tariffs could come as soon as April 2. Nearly every country would be affected, but the move could have particularly significant consequences for Europe, Japan and India.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The president’s plan seems likely to kick off intense negotiations with governments whose economies depend on exports to the U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/business/trump-inflation-tariffs.html" title="">It could also cause increased prices</a> and elicit trade wars. The tariffs would take into account a range of trade barriers imposed on American exports, including tariffs, taxes and domestic subsidies.</p><p>Just hours after announcing the tariffs, Trump met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, whom the president has accused of gaining an unfair trade advantage over the U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/13/us/trump-news" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><h2 id="link-45b6d1ea">In other politics news:</h2><ul><li><p>The Senate confirmed Robert F.
