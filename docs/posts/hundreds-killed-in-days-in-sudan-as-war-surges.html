Those gains came in part thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sudanese.armed.forces/posts/pfbid0Z1FqrawqzAxJGBZ2bty5J1vFn7DCiFhwFuD2qFUa6s1heKfPcViUx4gar3zjxFWJl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the defection</a> of Abu Aqla Kaykal, a local militia leader in El Gezira State who, until recently, was fighting with the Rapid Support Forces. Experts said his defection gave the military a political boost and would cut off the paramilitary group’s ability to recruit from the large Shukria tribe.</p><p>By publicizing the defection, Ms. Khair said, “the military are trying to assert their claim that they are on the right side” and that their wins are “a victory for the people of Sudan.”</p><p>The paramilitaries, who are led by Lt. Gen.

It said the damage was consistent with aerial bombardment, artillery and arson.</p><p>On Monday, a Sudanese military plane crashed about 90 miles north of El Fasher, killing two Russian crew members and several Sudanese fighters, according to Sudanese media reports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The paramilitaries, who claimed to have shot down the plane, posted a video of the burning wreckage, with jubilant fighters holding aloft two Russian passports and other identifying documents said to be found amid the debris.</p><p>An aviation official with knowledge of Sudanese military operations said the plane was one of two Ilyushin-76 planes bought last year by the Sudanese military, which has claimed that it was delivering supplies to besieged troops in El Fasher when it crashed.</p><p>But the official said the plane had also been used to carry out “barrel bomb” raids against the R.S.F., flinging crude improvised bombs, as part of the military’s escalating campaign of aerial bombardment.</p><p>The aviation official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military details.

Only last January, the same airline delivered support to the Rapid Support Forces through a base at Amdjarass in eastern Chad, according to a recent report by the Sudan Conflict Observatory, a research body funded by the State Department.</p><p>The Emirates has been running an extensive covert operation to supply the R.S.F. through the Amdjarass base, under the guise of providing humanitarian aid, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/world/africa/sudan-war-united-arab-emirates-chad.html" title="">The New York Times</a> and U.N. inspectors have reported. The Red Cross says it is investigating whether its emblem was misused as part of the operation. The Emirates denies supporting the R.S.F.</p><p>Documents found on the plane identified one of the Russians as Anton Selivanetz, who appears to have previously worked with the United Nations in Africa, according to a U.N. official and photographs posted to his personal Instagram account. The other man, Viktor Granov, was previously linked to arms trafficking in Africa by Amnesty International, as well as to the famous arms dealer Viktor A. Bout. Mr. Granov’s South African driver’s license was among the debris from the downed cargo plane.</p><p>The plane crash highlighted the outsize role of foreign contractors in the worsening conflict, pushing both local and global leaders <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/opinion/columnists/african-union-must-ensure-sudan-civilians-are-protected-4799370" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to call for the United Nations to deploy a mission</a> to protect civilians.</p><p>“This is very much a multiregional war of different actors,” Ms. Khair said.
