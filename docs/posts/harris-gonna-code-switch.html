But that has changed over the past 20 years or so, as the internet and especially social media have been so effective at getting the word out. I have rejoiced to see the public becoming ever more hip to the fact that language always changes, that you aren’t handicapping your child by raising them to be bilingual, that the way I just used “them” does not spell the fall of our Republic.</p><p>Twenty years ago I never thought I would hear the term “code-switching” used as widely as it now is beyond the halls of academe. Code-switching is perhaps best known in reference to alternating between different languages, such as English and Spanish. However, the same concept applies to different dialects of the same language, such as between a standard dialect and a colloquial one. But as glad as I am to see this, my heart sinks at the way people are mocking Vice President Kamala Harris for code-switching according to the audience she is speaking to. Barack Obama attracted <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/obama-talking-about-poverty-requires-code-switching-n357746" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism</a> for doing the same thing back in the aughts; I hoped we had gotten past this.</p><p>Harris does this readily. In an address in Atlanta responding to “Lock him up” calls about Donald Trump, she said, “The courts are gonna handle that,” later working up the crowd by referring in pep-talk style to “Novem-buh.” In a speech in Michigan she mentioned that “We have fun doin’ hard work.” Some of her switching is simply to good old colloquial American — gonna, doin’ — but at other times, especially for heavily Black audiences like the one in Atlanta, she switches into Black English: “Novem-buh”; “foah” for “four.”</p><p>A lot of people think there is something wrong with her doing this. “Harris seems to put on an accent for Atlanta rally,” read one <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6359683802112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chyron</a> on Fox News. One take on X, typical in its tone on the issue, displays familiarity with the term “code-switching” but <a href="https://x.com/EricAbbenante/status/1818964905476890708" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frames</a> it as a cynical act: “Code switching is a convenient way to describe blatant pandering.” Of course Trump has joined in asking “Did you hear a new accent?” with his running mate, JD Vance, right behind him claiming that Harris is using a “fake Southern accent.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>First of all, Harris is not doing a “Southern” accent. She is not summoning Jeff Foxworthy, the comedian Fortune Feimster or Rue McClanahan’s Blanche Devereaux. What people are hearing as Southern is Black English with which white Southern English overlaps only partially. Black English has a great many traits alien to white Southern.</p><p>More to the point, language is about reaching into another mind. It’s about connecting. Code-switching is one of the ways that humans use language to connect. Using the colloquial dialect of a language serves the same function as drinking or getting a mani-pedi together. It says, “We’re all the same.” It is especially natural, and common, when seeking connection about folksier things or summoning a note of cutting through the nonsense and getting to the heart of things in a “Let’s face it” way. This is why many of us readily say “Ain’t gonna happen” even if we aren’t given to saying “ain’t” regularly.</p><p>In a global sense, Harris’s code-switching is completely ordinary. Many people from other countries would be perplexed about anyone thinking her code-switching is remarkable, much less offensive. It is president Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt in the 1950s and 1960s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/learning-arabic-from-egypts-revolution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sprinkling</a> Egyptian Arabic, a colloquial variety, into his speeches that were mainly in the standard variety. It is a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Rottach-Egern_-_Kramer_Lad%E2%80%99l_-_Essen_ist_ein_Bed%C3%BCrfnis.jpg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restaurant sign</a> in Bavaria that starts out in standard German for “Eating is a need but enjoyment is an art,” but then glides as a “P.S.” into Bavarian dialect to say “Drum schaugst a bissl rei zu uns!” — “So take a little look-in at our place!”</p><p>Closer to home, Maya Angelou deftly explained how Black Americans code-switch when she wrote: “We learned to slide out of one language and into another without being conscious of the effort. At school, in a given situation, we might respond with, ‘That’s not unusual.’ But in the street, meeting the same situation, we easily said, ‘It be’s like that sometimes.’”</p><p>It is in this light that we must evaluate an <a href="https://x.com/ianmSC/status/1818435118329139619" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">X post</a> like “It’s pretty weird to change your accent on the fly depending on which audience you’re speaking to.” Wrong. This is like saying it’s pretty weird to dress according to what your plans for the day are.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Harris grew up among Black kids in Oakland, Calif., and went to Howard University, an HBCU, where she was a member of a sorority. I have never met Harris, but in my California days I spent a good deal of time in Oakland, and my sister went to an HBCU around the same time Harris was at Howard. I feel quite confident that Harris was richly immersed in code-switching between standard and Black English in her formative years. Today she is faking neither a “Southern” accent nor a Black one, but bringing to a national audience the sincere and effortless linguistic versatility that most Black Americans possess.</p><p>Other politicians in recent memory have ventured some code-switching, such as John Kerry saying “-in’” instead of “-ing” when speaking to some audiences and Hillary Clinton doing the same when <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/hillary-fakes-southern-accent-during-campaign-stop-in-alabama-video/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">addressing</a> Southern and Black audiences. Many found their language as inorganic as Harris’s detractors today find her code-switching, but there was a difference. Kerry and Clinton did not grow up switching between standard and vernacular as ongoingly, nor was their shift connected to identity, as Harris’s is. Harris is expressing her true self.</p><p>Harris’s detractors may claim that her doing so in public addresses is somehow not presidential. However, it is unclear how it is incompatible with being presidential to try to connect with the public. Shaking hands and kissing babies is one thing, but a reigning theme of our public culture since the late 1960s has been informality. T-shirts, jamming on the dance floor, jeans. Language usage has inevitably come along for the ride. Harris’s code-switching may be partly deliberate; she may be using it as a tool. But this is not cynicism but modernity.</p><p>It is interesting that people find this more intuitive when her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, does it. In his debut speech as Harris’s V.P. pick, Walz mainly used standard dialect but often code-switched richly into colloquial ’Murrican. He referred to his “summers workin’ on the family farm” and how “Muh dad was a teacher, muh brothers and sisters and I followed in their footsteps.” And announced that as a nation “We aren’t goin’ back,” “We got 91 days” and “We just gotta fight.” Apparently, it’s OK to summon a bit of pickup truck, but to summon a bit of, say, “urbanity” makes one a vulgar poseur.</p><p>But there is all reason to suppose that she will continue to do this regularly over the next few months — Harris gonna code switch — and that the usual suspects will roast her for it. Whether knocking her for code-switching is racist, prim or politically desperate is up for debate. What is certain is that these critiques, from the perspective of how language and communication work worldwide, are naïve.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John McWhorter (<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnHMcWhorter">@JohnHMcWhorter</a>) is an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University.
