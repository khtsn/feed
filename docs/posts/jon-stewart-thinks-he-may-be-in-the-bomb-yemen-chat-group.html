Now? You just wait for the national security adviser to be distracted by ‘White Lotus’ while he’s setting up his ‘Bomb Yemen’ group chat.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNMdRzK9Nj0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“By the way, I might be in this group chat, I don’t know. I don’t check my group chats.” <em>— JON STEWART</em></p><p>“This is not helping Pete Hegseth’s reputation as a guy who is always drunk. I mean, this is a drunk guy mistake. This is the national security equivalent of airdropping a <em>[expletive]</em> pic to everyone in the office.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON</em></p><p>“I thought top-secret war meetings were held in a vault on top of a mountain. I didn’t know we were just droppin’ ’em in the chat. Turns out Hegseth was planning wars like a mom in a busy grocery store talking on speakerphone.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Worst of all, now that journalist knows they’re all hanging out at Buffalo Wild Wings tonight, and they can’t uninvite him or it would be so awkward.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON</em></p><p>“He thought it was disinformation. Turned out it was just a bunch of fools, because the strikes started happening exactly as described in the texts. In other words, our national security is being guarded by a bunch of doofs you wouldn’t trust to throw your cousin a surprise party.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“No one on the chain thought to ask, ‘Who is JG? What are these initials?’ For all — they could have been leaking secrets to Jeff Goldblum, for all they know.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-47504485">The Punchiest Punchlines (Skin-Colored Skin Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“Donald Trump truly is focused on the issues that matter most — to him, specifically.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Yesterday, he posted — this is real — ‘Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the governor, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.’ He doesn’t like this painting of him that they hung in the State Capitol building in Colorado. This is the portrait. I have to be honest: I agree with him on this one. It’s not a very good likeness. I mean, look how inaccurate the skin color is. His skin is the color of skin.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“It kind of looks like the villain from ‘Pee-wee’s Big Adventure,’ Francis.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“I can see why he’d be upset, ’cause that looks exactly like him.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>The comedian Nikki Glaser interrupted Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show” monologue on Monday to share some dos and don’ts for spring break.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-102ce59">What We’re Excited About on Tuesday Night</h2><p>Jenna Ortega will discuss her part in the new horror comedy “Death of a Unicorn” on Tuesday’s “Late Show.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left to right, Dorit Kemsley, Sutton Stracke and Jennifer Tilly.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Griffin Nagel/Bravo</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
