Why are we treating some religions better than others based on that element of religious doctrine?”</p><p>Justice Neil M. Gorsuch echoed the point. “Isn’t it a fundamental premise of our First Amendment that the state shouldn’t be picking and choosing between religions,” he said. He added, “Doesn’t it entangle the state tremendously when it has to go into a soup kitchen, send an inspector in, to see how much prayer is going on?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked a lawyer for the state what the charity would have to do to, at a minimum, to qualify for the exemption.</p><p>The lawyer, Colin T. Roth, said one possibility was saying the Lord’s Prayer when the charity provides soup.</p><p>That answer did not appear to satisfy many of the justices.</p><p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that some religions do not proselytize. “As I understand it,” she said, “Judaism does not have that as part of its religion. So does that mean that Judaism is completely disqualified from getting the exemption when they’re running these sorts of organizations?”</p><p>Mr. Roth said it would suffice for the charity to engage in worship or religious education.</p><p>The case was the first of three religion cases to be heard by the court in the space of a month. Judging by the justices’ questions, it may turn out to be the easiest of the three.</p><p>The Supreme Court, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/politics/supreme-court-religion.html" title="">notably receptive to arguments from religious groups</a>, will hear arguments in April on whether a Catholic charter school in Oklahoma passes constitutional muster and then another case about whether parents in Maryland have a religious right to withdraw their children from classes including sexual themes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The case argued Monday, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-154.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Catholic Charities Bureau v. Wisconsin Labor &amp; Industry Review Commission</a>, No. 24-154<strong>, </strong>concerns a Wisconsin law that exempts religious groups from state unemployment taxes so long as they are “operated primarily for religious purposes.”</p><p>In an interview, Alan Rock, the executive director of Catholic Charities Bureau, said that the group’s work was closely tied to the social ministry of the Catholic Church by providing services to the poor in rural Wisconsin. “We are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers,” he said.</p><p>But state officials determined that the charity did not qualify for the exemption because it “provides essentially secular services and engages in activities that are not religious per se.”</p><p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed, adding that it was also a strike against the charity that it employed and served people of all religions.</p><p>Mr. Roth, the lawyer for the state, acknowledged that the charity would qualify for the exemption if it were part of the church rather than a separate corporation. But he said there must be principles that separate religious institutions from others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A ruling for the charity, he said, “would leave potentially over one million employees nationwide without unemployment coverage, like nurses and janitors at religiously affiliated hospitals.”</p><p>Justice Barrett said the case posed profound questions.</p><p>“If we had to articulate a test to distinguish religion from nonreligion,” she asked a lawyer for the charity, “can you concisely tell me what that test would say?”</p><p>The lawyer, Eric C. Rassbach, responded that “the overall thing is that there’s something transcendent or supernatural that you are feeling obligated by.”</p><p>But a majority of the justices seemed inclined to treat the central question in the case as simple and straightforward.</p><p>“There’s no dispute that Catholic Charities exist primarily for religious purposes,” Justice Gorsuch said. “There’s no dispute about the sincerity of their religious belief.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
