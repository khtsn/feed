                  <p>BC Game Masters, a VRS-eligible LAN, was announced on February 3 and is set to take place in Bucharest, Romania, with $50,000 on the line.</p>

                      <p>BC Game Masters announced with $50,000 prize</p>
                    </div>
                  </a>
                  <p>The question was, would <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/12878/bcgame" data-tooltip-id="uid996733655">BC.Game</a> be allowed to play or would they not be allowed due to a conflict of interest? In the past, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/12394/betboom" data-tooltip-id="uid1417344468">BetBoom</a> played at events like BetBoom Dacha before the advent of the VRS, but things have now changed, and the answer is no.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We’ve seen questions about BC.Game Esports and BC Game Masters Championship,&#34; BC.Game&#39;s esports account <a href="https://x.com/bcgamemasters/status/2021720343627337979?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">posted on X.</a> &#34;BC.Game Esports and the tournament are operated by separate entities. However, to avoid any speculation, BC.Game Esports will not participate in this event. GG HF.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The truth, however, is that it was not as up to <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/12878/bcgame" data-tooltip-id="uid996733655">BC.Game</a> as that post implies, as Valve would not allow them to play the tournament under the following guidelines used in conflict of interest cases such as this one.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We do not distinguish between team title sponsors (i.e., the name of the team includes the sponsor) and the team&#39;s ownership, even when these are separate entities,&#34; a Valve representative told HLTV.</p>
                  <p>&#34;In general:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>We would not accept a team&#39;s title sponsor/brand also being a sponsor of the tournament at any level.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>We would accept the tournament title sponsor being represented by teams in smaller ways (e.g., logos on jerseys).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Teams/sponsors may be hired by the tournament operator to provide some reasonable service (e.g., an arena or media company hired by the tournament operator), but the relationship should be made public.&#34;</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>So, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/12878/bcgame" data-tooltip-id="uid996733655">BC.Game</a> could not participate in BC Game Masters, or any event where BC.Game is a sponsor, and the same goes for any other team in the same situation.</p>
