    <h1>Biden’s Presidential Legacy: An Era of Change, Forever Marked by Trump</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Biden ran for the White House promising to be a transitional figure, then once he got there began thinking of himself as a transformational one. But after a tumultuous four years in office, it turns out he was really neither.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Biden will end up in the history books as an interregnum between two terms of Donald J. Trump, a break in the middle of a chaotic period of change, for good or ill. Mr. Biden had hoped to make Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/trump-america-election-victory.html" title="">an asterisk in the American story</a>, soon to be forgotten. Now he will be the one trying to make his case for posterity.</p><p>He will outline that case on Wednesday night in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/biden-farewell-address.html" title="">prime-time farewell address to the nation</a> in advance of leaving office on Monday.

But we came together as Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.”</p><p>But hobbled by inflation, illegal immigration and his own advancing age, Mr. Biden leaves office as an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unpopular one-term president</a>, turning over the Oval Office to a man he considers a fascist and a danger to democracy. He hopes that history will remember him more fondly than his contemporaries do and, as with other presidents, it just well might.</p><p>However, until the historians get around to their scorecards, here is a look at the highs and lows of the Biden presidency:</p><p>COVID-19 PANDEMIC</p><h2 id="link-28d4d9fe">Biden steered the country out of lockdown after a wave of death.</h2></div></div>
