But after a tumultuous four years in office, it turns out he was really neither.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Biden will end up in the history books as an interregnum between two terms of Donald J. Trump, a break in the middle of a chaotic period of change, for good or ill. Mr. Biden had hoped to make Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/trump-america-election-victory.html" title="">an asterisk in the American story</a>, soon to be forgotten. Now he will be the one trying to make his case for posterity.</p><p>He will outline that case on Wednesday night in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/biden-farewell-address.html" title="">prime-time farewell address to the nation</a> in advance of leaving office on Monday. Mr. Biden has a long list of accomplishments he takes pride in, including an expanded social safety net, a revived economy, major efforts to combat climate change and reinvigorated American leadership on the world stage.</p><p>“Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities,” he said in a letter to the public released Wednesday morning in advance of the speech. “We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. But we came together as Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.”</p><p>But hobbled by inflation, illegal immigration and his own advancing age, Mr. Biden leaves office as an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unpopular one-term president</a>, turning over the Oval Office to a man he considers a fascist and a danger to democracy. He hopes that history will remember him more fondly than his contemporaries do and, as with other presidents, it just well might.</p><p>However, until the historians get around to their scorecards, here is a look at the highs and lows of the Biden presidency:</p><p>COVID-19 PANDEMIC</p><h2 id="link-28d4d9fe">Biden steered the country out of lockdown after a wave of death.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15dc-biden-legacy-covid-sub2-wjqp/15dc-biden-legacy-covid-sub2-wjqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15dc-biden-legacy-covid-sub2-wjqp/15dc-biden-legacy-covid-sub2-wjqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15dc-biden-legacy-covid-sub2-wjqp/15dc-biden-legacy-covid-sub2-wjqp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="President Biden, Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff stand in front of the White House with their heads bowed while wearing masks.
