During those travels, which included dozens of hours in the air and visits to humid, polluted cities, Francis, 87, often appeared lively and energetic, but the cancellation of his audiences on Monday revived concerns about his health.</p><p>Francis, who has been using a wheelchair and who lost part of a lung when he was young, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital.html" title="">canceled some commitments in the past year</a> because of a flu and lung inflammation. The Vatican did not announce any changes to the trip to Belgium, which remained planned for Thursday to Sunday.</p><p>During that visit, Francis is scheduled to meet with a group of victims of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clergy, <a href="https://www.cathobel.be/2024/09/le-pape-francois-a-la-rencontre-de-victimes-dabus-sexuels-au-sein-de-leglise/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to CathoBel</a>, a website associated with the French-speaking church in Belgium. In 2010, a commission established by the church <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/11/world/europe/11belgium.html#:~:text=Pervasive%20Abuse%20Found%20in%20Belgian%20Church,-Share%20full%20article&amp;text=See%20how%20this%20article%20appeared,a%20report%20released%20Friday%20said." title="">reported pervasive abuse in the country</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Vatican did not confirm the meeting and said that if one were to happen, it would be discussed afterward. In March, Pope Francis defrocked a retired Belgian bishop, Roger Vangheluwe, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/world/europe/24vatican.html" title="">admitted over a decade ago</a> that he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/16/world/europe/16belgium.html" title="">sexually abused two of his nephews</a>.</p><p>Matteo Bruni, a Vatican spokesman, said at a news briefing on Monday, “The pope is aware of the difficulties, of the tragedies that there have been” in Belgium. Referring to possible actions during the coming trip, he added, “We can expect a reference to that.”</p><p>The pope is also expected to hold a meeting with refugees in Belgium, potentially highlighting the importance of welcoming foreigners in a country that hosts many E.U. institutions.</p><p>Francis has been hospitalized three times in the past few years. In June 2023, he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital.html" title="">surgery for a hernia</a> that had been causing painful intestinal blockages. He had a colon operation in 2021, and in March last year he was hospitalized because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital-release.html" title="">a respiratory infection</a>.</p><p>The pope’s Asia-Pacific trip this month was the longest of his 11-year tenure and was taken despite his having said that traveling has become harder for him. Supporters viewed the tour as a sign not only of his determination to build a church with a less Eurocentric future but also of his personal resilience.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Taking another trip, even a much shorter one, only two weeks after returning is likely to test that resilience again.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
