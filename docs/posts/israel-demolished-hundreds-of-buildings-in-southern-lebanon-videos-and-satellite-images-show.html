There has been little access to the area since the invasion began and the extent of the damage is unclear.</p><p>Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah, which began launching rocket attacks from southern Lebanon in solidarity with Hamas after its Oct 7. attacks on Israel and the country’s ensuing retaliation in Gaza. Both Israel and Lebanon have since traded fire across the border.</p><p>Israel says its ground invasion is aimed at returning Israelis to border communities. The country has accused Hezbollah of placing military infrastructure in civilian areas, and said it had issued advance evacuation warnings to civilians in villages where it said Hezbollah had embedded. Many in the region have fled, with some towns entirely depopulated. The United Nations says 1.4 million people have been displaced across the country.</p><p>According to The Times’s latest analysis, one village, Mhaibib, appears to have been virtually flattened, with only a handful of buildings still standing. In five other villages and towns, entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/video/25mideast-crisis-lebanon-beforeafter/25mideast-crisis-lebanon-beforeafter-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/video/25mideast-crisis-lebanon-beforeafter/25mideast-crisis-lebanon-beforeafter-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/video/25mideast-crisis-lebanon-beforeafter/25mideast-crisis-lebanon-beforeafter-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A side-by-side comparison of a town seen from a distance.

In statements on Telegram, the group said that it had targeted Israeli military positions in five of the villages. The group also said it had fought with Israeli forces in one of the villages, Aita al-Shaab.</p><p>Some international law experts have raised questions about the widespread nature of the destruction. Tom Dannenbaum, an associate professor of international law at Tufts University, said that nonmilitary structures may be targeted only if they are being used militarily, or if Israel has specific information that they are intended to be used that way. “It is not permitted to target an entire area in which there is a mix of military objectives and civilian objects,” he said.</p><p>The most severe destruction has been in the town of Meiss al-Jabal, which had a prewar population <a href="https://www.itihadjabalamel.com/details-190.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of about 8,000</a>.
