</span>. Leviatán sought to claim their first international playoff berth since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1015/valorant-champions-2022" target="_blank">Champions 2022</a>, while Vitality continued to chase the first of their own. </p>

<p>“One of us is going home, and that&#39;s not going to be me,” said <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8549/kingg">
		kiNgg	</a>
</span> in the <a href="https://youtu.be/IeYzkUe-KlA?si=kv4iPHiTisaCHajt" target="_blank">day 10 hype trailer</a>.</p>

<p>Leviatán&#39;s pick of Icebox saw constant back-and-forth swings between the two teams. Leviatán opened with the first pistol, which Vitality responded to with a thrifty round in round 5 using a full mid push. Leviatán stabilized to a 7-5 half in their favor with the help of their own thrifty in round 8 and effective B retakes.</p>


<p><em>Leviatán take the lead off the back of an Operator collateral from aspas.</em></p>

<p>The map remained on a knife&#39;s edge; Vitality made it to a 12-10 scoreline off of heroics from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/312/sayf">
		Sayf	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2168/trexx">
		trexx	</a>
</span>, but were unable to close it out. Leviatán rallied to secure four rounds in a row and take Icebox 14-12. kingg and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8480/aspas">
		aspas	</a>
</span> came online for Leviatán with 22 kills and 229 ACS for the in-game leader and 21 kills and 222 ACS for the duelist. trexx topped the scoreboard for the hornets with 22 kills and 225 ACS of his own.</p>


<p><em>Heroics from trexx are not enough as Mazino closes out round 20.</em></p>

<p>While Icebox was a brawl, Sunset was a stomp; Leviatán ended the first half with a 10-2 scoreline thanks to strong defensive setups and individual plays from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/619/c0m">
		C0M	</a>
</span> and aspas. Even when Vitality were allowed to plant the spike, they were unable to withstand the opponent&#39;s retakes.</p>

 
<p><em>A stunning ace clutch from C0M completely shuts down Vitality.</em></p>

<p>Vitality managed to take the second pistol round, but after a narrow failure to convert the bonus round by Sayf, Leviatán easily won the last three rounds to take Sunset 13-4. </p>

<p>Every player on Leviatán put up impressive numbers on the map, with four out of five of them having more than 140 ADR. <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7603/mazino">
		Mazino	</a>
</span> eked out the top rating in the server with a 1.45 rating, 15 kills to 12 deaths, and 169 ADR, while C0M barely trailed behind with a 1.43 rating and 16 kills to only 8 deaths. aspas ended the series with 36 kills to 26 deaths overall.</p>

<p>With this victory, Leviatán have secured their first international playoffs berth as an organization since Champions 2022, while Vitality will end their first global appearance since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN</a> with a 1-2 record. </p>

<p>Leviatán&#39;s first playoff opponent will be drawn later today. When asked who he would prefer to face in the post-match interview, C0M declared, “Give us anyone. We&#39;ll beat them.”</p>

<p>Leviatán will look to follow through on C0M&#39;s statement when they return for the playoffs, which begin on Aug. 14.</p>
