    <h1>Trump Calls Officials Handling Los Angeles Wildfires ‘Incompetent’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump offered fresh criticism early Sunday of the officials in charge of fighting the Los Angeles wildfires, calling them “incompetent” and asking why the blazes were not yet extinguished.</p><p>“The fires are still raging in L.A.,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump wrote</a> on his Truth Social site. “The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s comments indicated that the fires, and officials’ response to them, will likely occupy a prominent place on his domestic political agenda when he takes office on Jan. 20. He has renewed a longstanding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/politics/los-angeles-fires-trump-newsom.html" title="">feud with California’s governor</a>, Gavin Newsom, who in turn has accused Mr. Trump of politicizing the fires.</p><p>Mr. Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that he had invited Mr. Trump to visit “in the spirit of an open hand, not a closed fist,” but had yet to receive a response. The governor said he was taking seriously threats by the president-elect to withhold disaster assistance. If he were to do so, Mr. Newsom said, Mr. Trump would be in effect “threatening our first responders.”</p><p>California politicians have faced criticism since the fires broke out on Tuesday, including questions over how local and state authorities had prepared for them and how they have grown so quickly into huge blazes.</p><p>Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-mayor-karen-bass-wildfires.html" title="">had to contend with questions</a> about whether there was adequate warning about the likelihood of devastating fires, and why there was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-fire-water-hydrant-failure.html" title="">a shortage of water</a> and firefighters during the initial response. At a news conference on Thursday, she avoided a question about her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-mayor-fire-response.html" title="">absence from the city</a> when the fires began — she was in Ghana on a previously scheduled official visit — and said that any evaluation of mistakes or failures by “any body, department, individual” would come later.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
