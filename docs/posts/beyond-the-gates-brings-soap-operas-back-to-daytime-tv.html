She’d stop for dessert at Durfee’s Sweet Shoppe before catching up on her soap operas with a friend.</p><p>She had grown up watching her stories. “Generations,” the NBC soap opera that debuted in 1989 and the first to highlight a Black family from its inception, became must-watch television while she was in college. She saw herself in the characters, and she yearned for the 30-minute show, ultimately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/05/arts/fans-mourn-loss-of-an-interracial-soap-opera.html" title="">short-lived</a>, to be stretched into a daily hour like most other soaps.</p><p>Ducksworth started a career in television production with the idea of one day producing a soap opera even as they began to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/21/arts/as-the-world-turns-soap-operas-wane-and-viewers-grieve.html" title="">disappear</a> from the airwaves. In 2020, with her treasured daytime serials still front of mind, she agreed to lead a new partnership between CBS and the N.A.A.C.P., and immediately set out to resuscitate the faltering genre. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>That doggedness will result in something that has not occurred this century: a daytime soap debuting on a major television network. “Beyond the Gates,” premiering on Feb. 24, will be the first since NBC introduced “Passions” in 1999. And it will be the first ever that’s completely centered on a Black family.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/23/multimedia/23beyond-the-gates-02-pgtc/23beyond-the-gates-02-pgtc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/23/multimedia/23beyond-the-gates-02-pgtc/23beyond-the-gates-02-pgtc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/23/multimedia/23beyond-the-gates-02-pgtc/23beyond-the-gates-02-pgtc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="On a living room film set, two men sit on a couch to the left and two women sit on a love seat on the right.
