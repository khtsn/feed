Then “the president will make a decision on the merits,” said the notice, issued by the E.P.A. on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Joseph Goffman, former executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program who served as E.P.A. assistant administrator for air pollution under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said he feared the President Trump was “setting up a rubber stamp process” that would allow companies to avoid a long list of rules on air pollution.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Normally, the agency would lay down more specific criteria for exemptions to a rule, he said. He also said that Congress had clearly intended for Clean Air Act exemptions to come with conditions that would ensure at least some pollution limits.</p><p>“Because none of that is present, it strongly suggests that the decisions will be at best ad hoc,” Mr. Goffman said. “That’s in defiance of Congress’s intent, in defiance of the public health needs of the communities that are affected, and in defiance of the E.P.A.’s past practices.”</p><p>Molly Vaseliou, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., pushed back against that view, saying nowhere in the law was there an explicit requirement for such conditions. “This type of ‘legal analysis’ seems consistent with people who were responsible” for interpretations of laws the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/climate/supreme-court-epa.html" title="">has struck down</a>, she said in an email.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The latest move is part of an effort led by the E.P.A.’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, to steer the agency away from its original role of environmental protection and regulation. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/climate/epa-zeldin-rollbacks-pollution.html" title="">described its mission</a> as lowering the cost of purchasing cars, heating homes and running businesses, and encouraging what he has referred to previously as American energy dominance.</p><p>Under Mr. Zeldin, the E.P.A. has said it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/climate/trump-epa-workers-zeldin.html" title="">plans to slash jobs</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/climate/trump-eliminates-epa-science.html" title="">eliminate its scientific research arm</a>, ensure enforcement actions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/climate/epa-pollution-enforcement.html" title="">don’t interfere with energy production</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/climate/trump-epa-layoffs.html" title="">reduce the agency’s overall budget</a> by 65 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, in Ohio last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gene J.

Another is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/climate/epa-sets-limits-on-ethylene-oxide.html" title="">ethylene oxide</a>, a colorless gas that is widely used to sterilize medical devices and is also a carcinogen.</p><p>Mr. Zeldin, a former member of Congress from New York, has also said he would allow coal-burning power plants to apply for exemptions from a new rule that requires them to address the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/coal-ash-spill-dam-breach.html" title="">health risks of coal ash</a>, a toxic substance created by burning coal to produce electricity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The agency has said it intends to ultimately rewrite many of these same rules, an arduous process that is expected to take time. So the E.P.A. appears to be pursuing “a two-step process where it says it’s going to take the next few years to roll back the rules,” but in the meantime avoid companies having to meet any of them, said James Pew, director of clean air practice at the environmental group Earthjustice.</p><p>“It’s hard to imagine how these exemptions could be lawful,” Mr. Pew said. For all of the new rules, for example, the Biden administration had already identified alternative technology that was available and affordable. The idea that the ability to pollute was in the national interest was also hard to buy, he said.</p><p>As of Thursday, it was unclear whether the agency had started to receive exemption applications, whether any had been granted, and if or how they would be disclosed. Companies must apply for exemptions by the end of the month, the E.P.A. said.</p><p>“We appreciate the Trump E.P.A.’s willingness to consider exemptions for manufacturers that are negatively impacted by these regulations,” Alexa Lopez, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Manufacturers, an industry group, said in a statement. “The NAM stands ready to work with the administration to provide durable solutions that both protect the environment and preserve the ability of manufacturers to compete on the global stage.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-11"></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>March 27, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article described incorrectly a provision of the Clean Air Act. It says the president may grant exemptions if the technology required to meet a rule is not available and if the exemption is in the interest of national security. It does not say an exemption can be granted based on one of those conditions.</p></div><div><div><hr/><p>When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.
