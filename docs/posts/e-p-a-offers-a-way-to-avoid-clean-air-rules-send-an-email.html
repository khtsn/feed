Then “the president will make a decision on the merits,” said the notice, issued by the E.P.A. on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Joseph Goffman, former executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program who served as E.P.A. assistant administrator for air pollution under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said he feared the President Trump was “setting up a rubber stamp process” that would allow companies to avoid a long list of rules on air pollution.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Normally, the agency would lay down more specific criteria for exemptions to a rule, he said. He also said that Congress had clearly intended for Clean Air Act exemptions to come with conditions that would ensure at least some pollution limits.</p><p>“Because none of that is present, it strongly suggests that the decisions will be at best ad hoc,” Mr. Goffman said. “That’s in defiance of Congress’s intent, in defiance of the public health needs of the communities that are affected, and in defiance of the E.P.A.’s past practices.”</p><p>Molly Vaseliou, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., pushed back against that view, saying nowhere in the law was there an explicit requirement for such conditions. “This type of ‘legal analysis’ seems consistent with people who were responsible” for interpretations of laws the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/climate/supreme-court-epa.html" title="">has struck down</a>, she said in an email.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, in Ohio last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The latest policy allows for companies to apply for exemptions of up to two years, the maximum allowed under the Clean Air Act, from numerous new restrictions on emissions of toxic chemicals like mercury and arsenic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/climate/epa-sets-limits-on-ethylene-oxide.html" title="">as well as ethylene oxide</a>, a colorless gas that is widely used to sterilize medical devices and is also a carcinogen.</p><p>Mr. Zeldin, a former member of Congress from New York, has also said he would allow coal-burning power plants to apply for exemptions from a new rule that requires them to address the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/coal-ash-spill-dam-breach.html" title="">health risks of coal ash</a>, a toxic substance created by burning coal to produce electricity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The agency has said it intends to ultimately rewrite many of these same rules, an arduous process that is expected to take time. So the E.P.A. appears to be pursuing “a two-step process where it says it’s going to take the next few years to roll back the rules,” but in the meantime avoid companies having to meet any of them, said James Pew, director of clean air practice at the environmental group Earthjustice.</p><p>“It’s hard to imagine how these exemptions could be lawful,” Mr. Pew said. For all of the new rules, for example, the Biden administration had already identified alternative technology that was available and affordable. The idea that the ability to pollute was in the national interest was also hard to buy, he said.</p><p>As of Thursday, it was unclear whether the agency had started to receive exemption applications, whether any had been granted, and if or how they would be disclosed. Companies must apply for exemptions by the end of the month, the E.P.A. said.</p><p>The National Association of Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, and the American Chemistry Council, which represent major regulated industries, did not immediately respond to comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hiroko Tabuchi covers pollution and the environment for The Times.
