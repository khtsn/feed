At the same time, Russian soldiers in Ukraine have continued advancing on other parts of the front there, which Kyiv had hoped to stabilize by prompting a diversion of Russian units back home to defend Kursk.</p><p>Ukraine and Russia are also engaged in air assaults, targeting each other’s military bases and energy infrastructure as each side tries to degrade the other’s capacity to sustain the war effort. In addition, Russia<span>  </span>continues to regularly hit civilian areas in devastating attacks that cause frequent casualties.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the current situation on the battlefield.</p><h2 id="link-325271fe">Russia has begun to counterattack in Kursk.</h2><p>In the past few weeks, the front line had been somewhat stable in the Kursk region, which Ukraine first invaded on Aug. 6. As Moscow sent in more troops to reinforce its defenses in the area — as many as 30,000, according to Ukrainian officials — the Ukrainian advance largely stopped and Kyiv has moved to fortify its positions along the more than 500 square miles of territory that it controlled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But the front line has moved again in the past few days, after Moscow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk.html" title="">began a concerted counterattack</a> last week in the area. <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps of the battlefield</a> compiled by independent groups based on satellite images and battlefield footage show that Russian troops have regained some territory around the bulge of land seized by Ukraine.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In particular, Russian forces have driven a small wedge into the western edge of the Ukrainian bulge, recapturing at least one village, Snagost, and several other settlements. Videos posted on social media and verified by The New York Times showed Russian troops <a href="https://t.me/UkropHunter/175" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raising the Russian flag in Snagost</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ZA_FROHT/33238" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moving freely through and clearing homes</a> in Krasnooktyabr’skoe, a nearby settlement.</p><p>On Monday, the Russian authorities ordered the evacuation of civilians from two districts directly west of that area, suggesting plans for a counterassault there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian military vehicle passing by a destroyed Russian border post near Sumy, Ukraine, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Ukrainian forces, too, have been on the move in recent days, pushing through another section of the border near the settlement of Novyi Put’, to the southwest of the main area of the Russian counterattack.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Verified videos posted on Thursday showed a Ukrainian engineering vehicle plowing through fortifications along the border, allowing other Ukrainian military vehicles to pass through. The next day, videos showed Ukrainian forces advancing into Russia from the point where they breached the border toward Veseloe, a village about two miles from the border.</p><p>Analysts say this may be an attempt to hamper the Russian counterattack by opening a new front on its flank, but it remains unclear whether Ukrainian troops have held onto any territory there.</p><p>Kyrylo Sazonov, a Ukrainian soldier fighting in the Kursk region, said the situation on the battlefield was shifting by the hour.</p><p>“By the time we discuss an event, the situation has likely already changed,” he <a href="https://global.espreso.tv/russia-ukraine-war-combat-operations-in-kursk-region-are-highly-dynamic-with-no-defined-contact-line-ukrainian-military" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Ukrainian television</a> on Sunday. “There’s no fixed line of contact here. For instance, some of our troops moved in with mortars to support others but walked into an ambush from three sides.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Both our side and the Russians are acting unpredictably,” he added.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-67a67e42">Ukrainian troops are on the backfoot in the east.</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-oleksandr-syrsky.html" title="">Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi</a>, Ukraine’s top general, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/B25lLFhM-kc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last month that one goal of Ukraine’s cross-border assault into Kursk was to compel Moscow to divert troops from the front line in Ukraine to reinforce its own border region, thus relieving pressure on Kyiv’s troops fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>But so far, Russia has withdrawn only a limited number of experienced units from the Ukrainian battlefield, according to military analysts and Western officials.</p><p>Instead, it has sought to defend its territory and launch counterattacks with combat units largely drawn from within Russia, keeping the bulk of its forces in Ukraine to press ahead with assaults, particularly in the eastern Donetsk region, which Moscow already partly controls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Ukraine’s 79th Air Assault Brigade firing a howitzer toward Russian positions in the Pokrovsk region.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>That has been particularly true near <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-evacuation-pokrovsk.html" title="">Pokrovsk</a>, a strategic eastern Ukrainian city that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-pokrovsk-attacks.html" title="">Russian forces have been steadily closing in on</a> in the past few weeks despite Ukraine’s own offensive into Russia.</p><p>Russian forces are now about five miles from Pokrovsk, which is an important railway hub for the Ukrainian Army.

The city’s population has now dwindled to 16,000 from about 62,000 in early August, according to the local authorities.</p><p>Russian advances toward Pokrovsk have slowed somewhat recently as Moscow’s troops try to break through the main Ukrainian defensive lines protecting the city. Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst from the Finland-based Black Bird Group, said those consisted of a network of trenches, anti-tank obstacles and troops on favorable terrain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Ukrainian national police helped a woman evacuate from the town of Myrnohrad in the Pokrovsk region this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At the same time, as the Russian forces have run up against the Ukrainian defenses around Pokrovsk, they have advanced in an area farther south, toward the town of Kurakhove, from different sides.</p><p>“Russia will likely push aggressively as long as possible, as any significant gains in Donetsk have been very difficult to achieve quickly,” Mr. Kastehelmi <a href="https://x.com/emilkastehelmi/status/1830251231358718238" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. “The window of opportunity is open, and they will try to exploit the recently appeared cracks in the Ukrainian defenses.”</p><h2 id="link-aff2f7">Air assaults have intensified.</h2><p>Russia is pressing ahead with its air campaign against energy infrastructure in Ukraine, with the latest attack on Tuesday targeting power plants in the northeastern Sumy region, according to the local authorities. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/world/europe/ukraine-heat-wave-electricity.html" title="">Ukraine’s energy network has been so damaged by months of attacks</a> that experts and officials have warned that power cuts will be unavoidable this winter.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-drone-attack.html" title="">Russia has also ramped up its air attacks on urban centers</a> across Ukraine in recent weeks.
