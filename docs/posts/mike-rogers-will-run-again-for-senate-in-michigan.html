The race, in a battleground state that President Trump won in 2024 and Joseph R. Biden Jr. won in 2020, will help decide control of the Senate. It is expected to be among the most closely watched in next year’s midterm elections.</p><p>In a video released by his campaign on Monday, Mr. Rogers said he would “stand with” the president and “deliver on the mandate given to him by the American people.”</p><p>“Alongside President Trump,” Mr. Rogers said in the video, “I’ll fight to bring good, high-paying manufacturing jobs back to Michigan.” He added a “guarantee” that he would protect Social Security for older Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Rogers, 61, is a former F.B.I. special agent and Army officer who served in Congress for 14 years, including four as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He left Congress in 2015 to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/magazine/radio-killed-the-political-star.html" title="">become a talk-radio host</a> and eventually moved to Florida. His return to Michigan in 2023 failed to appease Democrats, who <a href="https://x.com/MichiganDems/status/1816526753525068090" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labeled him a disloyal opportunist</a> in his race against Ms. Slotkin. That tightly fought contest, in which Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Rogers, was one of the last Senate races to be called in 2024.</p><p>Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Republican majority leader, and Senator Tim Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, both endorsed Mr. Rogers’s bid.</p><p>Mr. Rogers would “help achieve President Trump’s America First agenda” if elected, Mr. Thune said in a statement. Mr. Scott said he was confident that Mr. Rogers’s candidacy would solidify the Republican Senate majority in 2026.</p><p>Mr. Rogers is so far the only Republican to enter the 2026 race, though Representative Bill Huizenga, who has served in Congress since 2011, is expected to run. Other possible contenders include Tudor Dixon, who lost the Michigan governor’s race to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2022, and Kevin Rinke, who lost to Ms. Dixon in that race’s Republican primary.</p><p>The lone Democrat to have entered the race, State Senator Mallory McMorrow, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/michigan-senate-democrats-mallory-mcmorrow.html" title="">announced her candidacy this month</a>. Ms. McMorrow gained national prominence in 2022 when she defended her liberal values in a video while also calling herself a “straight, white, Christian, married suburban mom.” Two other Democrats — Representative Haley Stevens and Abdul El-Sayed, a former health director in Wayne County, Mich. — are eyeing the race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Several Democrats have notably decided to skip the contest. Both Ms. Whitmer, who is barred from running for re-election because of term limits, and Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary in the Biden administration who moved to Michigan in 2022, have said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/buttigieg-michigan-senate-2028-president.html" title="">they will not run</a>, decisions that could make way for 2028 presidential bids. Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet said last week that she <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/10/kristen-mcdonald-rivet-us-senate-michigan-mallory-mcmorrow-mike-rogers-haley-stevens-abdul-el-sayed/83027228007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">planned to run for re-election</a>.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
