Though the ruling might have come too late to change anything in the current election, experts said it could eventually undermine similar practices around the country.</p><p>A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sided with the Republican National Committee, the Mississippi Republican Party and other plaintiffs who had challenged the law. They had argued that the state had effectively extended each election beyond the date set by federal law.</p><p>The defendants, including Mississippi’s secretary of state, countered that although all votes must be cast by Election Day, states were free to take longer to receive and count the votes. In a written opinion, the judges disagreed.</p><p>“Congress statutorily designated a singular ‘day for the election’ of members of Congress and the appointment of presidential electors,” wrote Judge Andrew S. Oldham. “Text, precedent and historical practice confirm this ‘day for the election’ is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The panel sent the case back to the district court that had sided with the defendants, telling the lower court to reconsider the case. That means the lower court could still allow late-arriving ballots to be counted this year.</p><p>The panel members said the lower court should give “due consideration to ‘the value of preserving the status quo in a voting case on the eve of an election.’”</p><p>The decision is binding only in Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, which are under the Fifth Circuit’s jurisdiction. But its logic, if applied around the country, would invalidate similar laws in <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-11-receipt-and-postmark-deadlines-for-absentee-mail-ballots" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 20 states</a> that count absentee ballots received after Election Day, including the battleground state of Nevada.</p><p>Legal experts said the U.S. Supreme Court would be unlikely to review the case before Nov. 5 and issue a ruling that would apply nationally, because the court is generally reluctant to alter voting rules so close to an election.</p><p>But liberal groups that opposed the lawsuit said the Fifth Circuit’s ruling could nonetheless cast a shadow over the practice of counting absentee votes received after Election Day, sowing mistrust in a presidential contest that polls show is extremely close.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In Mississippi, a Republican-dominated state that is all but guaranteed to send its electoral votes to former President Donald J. Trump, the lawsuit created an unusual spectacle: It pitted the national and state Republican parties against the state’s Republican secretary of state and attorney general.</p><p>Mississippi’s solicitor general, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/us/politics/scott-stewart-mississippi-supreme-court.html" title="">Scott Stewart</a>, a rising star in the conservative legal world who successfully argued the case that led the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, defended Mississippi’s absentee ballot law during oral arguments before the appellate court in September.</p><p>“States make these choices, they have a lot of discretion, and if Congress or the people themselves think as a whole that those are a bad idea, they can come in and act,” Mr. Stewart said.</p><p>The defendants argued that Congress had never shown any sign of opposing laws like Mississippi’s, which passed the Republican-controlled State Legislature in 2020.</p><p>The lawsuit named local election officials in Harrison County, a Republican stronghold on the Gulf Coast, as defendants. The county of just over 200,000 people receives only 10 to 20 absentee ballots after the deadline in each election, said Tim Holleman, the county attorney who represented the local officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It really never got clear to me why these folks were worried about it,” Mr. Holleman said.</p><p>While the decision’s effect will probably be limited in Mississippi, the ruling could have greater significance elsewhere, experts in election law said.</p><p>But the political implications are unclear. There are indications that not counting absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day could actually hurt Republicans, said Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who studies voting.</p><p>For example, people in rural areas are more likely to skew Republican, and are more likely to be affected by mail delays that cause their absentee ballots to arrive late, Mr. McDonald said. “Democrats who have mail ballots in hand, they’re returning their mail ballots at a faster rate than the Republicans are right now,” he said.</p><p>In August, a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed a lawsuit over a similar ballot-counting law in Illinois, finding that the Republican plaintiffs hadn’t shown the law had hurt them and thus lacked standing.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
