    <h1>Inside a Deadly Southern California Jail System: 5 Takeaways</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="link-13df8fd5">The department failed to adequately monitor detainees and intervene when they attempted suicide.</h2><p>When Ms. Upton was booked at a county jail in April 2022, deputies noted, she was distraught and told them “she always kinda wanted to die.” She was housed in the jail’s mental health unit for women, where a cell camera feed was required to be constantly monitored by deputies/guards to protect detainees’ safety.</p><p>One evening, she contacted a guard through her cell’s intercom, but whoever answered hung up almost immediately. The video then captured her saying she would kill herself, and showed the steps she took in ending her life. But deputies did not notice for 20 minutes after the intercom call.</p><h2 id="link-4b7aaf54">Detainees with mental illnesses were able to block cell cameras and cell door windows, despite rules forbidding it.</h2><p>Aaron Aubrey spent the better part of two years segregated from other people in the jail system after being accused of killing another detainee in 2020. About 40 minutes before he was found dead in his cell, a deputy saw that he had covered his cell door window and camera, but did not intervene. That is contrary to standard practice, according to current and former employees.</p><h2 id="link-7d7db314">Deputies did not always place people expressing suicidal thoughts in cells where they can be constantly monitored.</h2><p>Robert Robinson told deputies he was having suicidal thoughts when he was arrested in September 2022. He was not placed on suicide watch or put in a cell with an internal monitoring camera, according to court records. He later told deputies he was suicidal, but after a brief examination by jail medical staff, he was cleared to return to his cell. About an hour later, he was found dead.</p><h2 id="link-22c9f7f">The department has omitted pertinent facts about the deaths to families and to the public.</h2><p>Mario Solis had been prescribed antipsychotic medication during his chaotic five-month incarceration. Three times, he said he was suicidal and talked about stabbing himself with a pencil. In September 2022, while held in a cell in a mental health unit, he died after swallowing two pencils, soap and other items.</p></div></div>
