He dug in on the battlefield — despite mounting pressures and costs — to wait out Western resolve in a far longer and more onerous conflict than Moscow had expected. Now, the Russian leader may believe his moment has come to shift the balance of power in favor of the Kremlin, not only in Ukraine.</p><p>“I think he sees real opportunity, both to win the war in Ukraine, effectively, but also to sideline the U.S. not just from Ukraine but from Europe,” said Max Bergmann, a Russia analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington who worked at the State Department during the Obama administration.</p><p>The Russian leader’s “grandiose objective,” Mr. Bergmann said, is the destruction of NATO, the 32-country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-nato.html" title="">military alliance</a> led by the United States, which was established after World War II to protect Western Europe from the Soviet Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I think that is right now all on the table,” Mr. Bergmann said.</p><p>The opening represents one of the biggest opportunities for Mr. Putin in his quarter-century in power in Russia.</p><p>For years, Mr. Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/05/world/europe/putin-tells-the-russians-we-shall-be-stronger.html" title="">has lamented</a> the weakness Russia showed in the decade after the fall of the Soviet Union and has fixated on reversing the influence the United States has since gained in Europe at the Kremlin’s expense.</p><p>Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine three years ago, Mr. Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/17/world/europe/russia-nato-security-deal.html" title="">issued demands</a> to the United States and its European allies that went far beyond Ukraine, proposing the resurrection of Cold War-style spheres of influence in a Europe divided between Moscow and Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump’s return to the White House has shifted the geopolitical environment in Mr. Putin’s favor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L.

He also asked the United States and its Western European allies not to deploy any military forces or weaponry in the Central and Eastern European countries that once answered to Moscow.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Many of those nations, such as Estonia, Poland and Romania, have been NATO members for decades and would be difficult to defend against a Russian invasion without pre-positioned troops and equipment.</p><p>“In Putin’s view, it’s the most powerful countries that should get to determine the rules of the road,” said Angela Stent, emerita professor of government at Georgetown University. “Smaller countries, whether they like it or not, have to listen to them.”</p><p>Never mind, Ms. Stent said, that Russia lacks a superpower economy. “But it does have nuclear weapons, it has oil and gas and a veto on the U.N. Security Council,” she said. “It’s just power, hard power.”</p><p>At the time, the West immediately rejected Mr. Putin’s prewar proposals as unthinkable. The Russian leader is now almost certain to revive them in impending negotiations with Mr. Trump, a longtime skeptic of NATO and American troop presence in Europe. That has prompted a crisis among European allies, who are worried about what the U.S. president might concede.</p><p>“There is something very big going on at the moment,” said Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London. “This is not business as usual. This is a very different administration, and it’s very hard to see how trans-Atlantic relations will be the same at the end of this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Even if Mr. Trump’s return has shifted the geopolitical environment in Mr. Putin’s favor, the Russian leader has suffered serious setbacks over three years of war, and so far has failed to achieve his goal of bringing Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A NATO-related training exercise in Romania last week.

NATO <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/world/europe/sweden-nato-neutrality.html" title="">has expanded</a> to include two more nations in Russia’s backyard, Finland and Sweden, the opposite of what Mr. Putin intended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“If you’re sitting in the Kremlin looking at this, yes, there is an opportunity, but don’t get your hopes too high,” said Thomas Graham, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who served as a top White House adviser on Russia during the George W. Bush administration. “A lot could change quickly, and at the end of the day, Trump is unreliable.”</p><p>To end the war, Mr. Graham added, both parties need to agree to stop fighting. Ukraine and its European backers most likely will not simply accept a raw deal that Mr. Trump cuts with Mr. Putin, despite intense pressure they might face from Washington.</p><p>“This is a lot more complicated than simply Putin and Trump sitting down and signing a piece of paper basically prepared by Putin,” Mr. Graham said, noting that he “wouldn’t pop the champagne corks in Moscow right now,” even if Russia appears to be in a better position than it once was.</p><p>Heading into talks, Mr. Trump faces the added difficulty that Mr. Putin is not a popular figure among the American public. Any deal seen as Kremlin appeasement could prove difficult to sell at home, though the vast majority of Americans favor a quick end to the conflict, which Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A billboard showing an advertisement for military service in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Sunday.
