Israel carried out deadly airstrikes, which had not happened there in about two decades.</p><p>Twelve Palestinians were killed during the operation, which involved about 1,000 Israeli soldiers. Militant groups claimed at least nine of them as members. One Israeli soldier was also killed, possibly mistakenly by a fellow soldier. Thousands of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/world/middleeast/israel-withdraws-jenin-west-bank.html" title="">fled their homes</a> and Israel detained and interrogated many others. Here are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/world/europe/israel-raid-jenin-photos.html" title="">pictures of the raid</a>.</p><p><strong>Oct. 19, 2023: </strong>At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/world/middleeast/west-bank-israel-drone.html" title="">13 Palestinians and one Israeli officer</a> were killed in clashes, less than two weeks after the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. At least five of the 13 Palestinians were children.</p><p>The worst clashes were in Nur Shams. Israel’s military said that it was “thwarting terrorist infrastructure and confiscating weapons” in the operation — and that Palestinians had fought back, shooting and throwing improvised bombs.</p><p><strong>Dec. 12-14, 2023: </strong>An<strong> </strong>Israeli raid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/14/world/middleeast/israel-jenin-12-killed.html" title="">killed at least 12 people</a> during a two-and-a-half-day incursion in Jenin. A 13-year-old was pronounced dead at a hospital after his father carried him there, according to the medical charity <a href="https://twitter.com/MSF_canada/status/1734997686133428679?s=20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Doctors Without Borders</a>, which said Israeli armored cars had blocked ambulances.</p><p>At least 34 other people were injured. The Palestinian Prisoners Club, a rights group, said that at least 100 Palestinians had been arrested.</p><p>Israel disciplined three soldiers for a video showing some of them singing a Jewish prayer in a mosque in Jenin during the raid. The footage had circulated widely online.</p><p><strong>Jan. 7, 2024: </strong>At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/01/07/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news/eight-palestinians-and-an-israeli-officer-are-killed-in-west-bank-violence?smid=url-share" title="">nine Palestinians and an Israeli officer</a> were killed during a day of violence. A drone strike killed seven men in pre-dawn clashes during an incursion into Jenin. Four were brothers, aged 22 to 29, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency, Wafa, said.</p><p>Israeli soldiers killed an eighth man in the central West Bank, Palestinian health officials said. And a 3-year-old girl was killed, apparently by errant fire, when Israeli forces said they shot at a car that rammed a checkpoint near Jerusalem.</p><p>The Israeli border police officer was killed when a bomb blew up her military vehicle.</p><p><strong>Jan. 30, 2024: </strong>Israeli soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-west-bank.html" title="">raided a hospital</a> and fatally shot a Hamas commander in a patient’s room. During the brief incursion, some of the soldiers were wearing medical garb, surveillance footage showed, as they brandished their guns in the hospital. Two other men were also killed in the shooting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/30/world/middleeast/30vidisrael-hamas-jenin-hospital/30vidisrael-hamas-jenin-hospital-square640.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The Palestinian Authority Health Ministry released surveillance video that shows armed members of Israeli forces dressed in civilian clothes inside Ibn Sina Specialized Hospital in Jenin.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Experts said the raid raised questions because hospitals have special protection under international laws of war.</p><p><strong>April 20, 2024:</strong> Israeli soldiers killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/20/world/israel-iran-gaza-war-news/israeli-raid-on-a-refugee-camp-in-the-west-bank-kills-10-people?smid=url-share" title="">at least 10 people</a> at the Nur Shams camp, the military said, in what it described as a “counterterrorism operation.” Palestinian officials said that at least 14 people had died, including a 15-year-old boy.</p><p>The next day, Palestinians in the West Bank went on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/world/middleeast/west-bank-gaza-raid.html" title="">general strike</a> in protest: Shops, schools, universities, banks and public transit were closed or stopped.</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The War That Won’t End:</strong> It’s been nearly a year since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. “The Daily” explains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/podcasts/the-daily/israel-gaza-hamas.html">why the conflict is still going</a>, and what it would take to end it.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Spotlight on Israel’s Bedouins:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/who-is-qaid-farhan-al-qadi-israel-hostage.html">Farhan al-Qadi</a>, the hostage rescued by the Israeli military from Gaza, is a member of the Bedouin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostage-bedouin.html">an Arab community marginalized by Israel</a> that suffered painful losses on Oct. 7.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-Iran Nuclear Talks:</strong> Iran’s supreme leader suggested that his country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks-khamenei.html">would pursue nuclear negotiations</a> with the United States, but it was unclear if his comments signaled a shift in relations between the two countries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hamas’s Elusive Leader:</strong> Yahya Sinwar is by far Hamas’s most important figure, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/israel-hamas-sinwar.html">his success in evading capture or death</a> has denied Israel a military success that could help end the war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s Orphans:</strong> The war in Gaza is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-orphans.html">making so many orphans</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-orphans.html"> </a>that no agency or aid group can count them.
