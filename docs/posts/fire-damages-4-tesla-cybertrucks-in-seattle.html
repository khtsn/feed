Fire crews moved the four electric vehicles to keep anything else from catching fire, Mr. Cuerpo said, and there were no injuries or other damage.</p><p>The Seattle Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are investigating the fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In an email on Monday, Mr. Cuerpo declined to confirm what type of electric vehicles were involved because the investigation is continuing.

Over the weekend, protesters were arrested at a nonviolent demonstration at a Tesla dealership in Lower Manhattan.</p><p>Federal prosecutors have also stepped in, charging a person with malicious destruction of property last week and accusing them of spray-painting “Nazi” onto the side of a Tesla dealership and planting a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle, according to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-co/pr/lyons-resident-charged-connection-series-incidents-loveland-tesla-dealership" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Attorney’s Office in Colorado</a>.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
