Trump. Hundreds of paid staff members worked to build enduring relationships with Arizonans whom Turning Point saw as friendly to Republicans, targeting a smaller universe of voters than traditional canvassing operations.</p><p>Turning Point’s gamble appears to have paid off, at least in Arizona.</p><p>Newly released voting data compiled by TargetSmart, a Democratic polling firm, shows a distinct G.O.P. advantage among infrequent voters: About 30,000 registered Republicans in Arizona who had not voted since at least 2018 cast a ballot this year. Democrats turned out just 20,000 of the same types of voters.</p><p>Among slightly more reliable voters — those who skipped the 2022 midterm elections but voted in other recent elections — Republicans still held an edge in Arizona, turning out 185,000 compared with 157,000 for Democrats. And the G.O.P. had an even greater advantage among first-time voters, with 202,000 such Republicans casting a ballot and just 145,000 such Democrats doing the same.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>One of the many unorthodox elements of Mr. Trump’s campaign was how it partnered its ground game with allied groups like Turning Point and America PAC, the super PAC funded by Elon Musk. These groups, called “coordinated canvassing partners,” both shared data with and received it from the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign.</p><p>While these groups carried out parallel efforts in battleground states like Wisconsin, Turning Point had the largest footprint in Arizona, and its staff members there kept up frequent contact with targeted voters in an effort to build deeper personal relationships.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
