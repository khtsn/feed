We look back at his evolving relationship with Congress through the speeches he gave during his first term.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“The president of the United States.” Tuesday will be President Trump’s fifth time addressing a joint session of Congress. “Our union is stronger than ever before.” His last address ended with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, ripping up the speech in a show of defiance, reflecting the antagonism that plagued his first term. Let’s rewind to the beginning. Appearing triumphant, Trump addressed a Republican- controlled Congress amid claims of Russian meddling in the election. “A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning.” His speech struck an ambitious tone, calling for party unity to advance his America First agenda. Fast forward to 2018. “Strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas Strip.” “Terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.” That year, Trump painted a grim picture of American hardship and survival and cast illegal immigration as a root cause of the nation’s problems. “Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.” “Get the job done.” Moving ahead to 2019. That year, the House had flipped to Democratic control with the help of a new wave of congresswomen ready to get to work. Congress had just returned from the longest government shutdown in history, and the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election was winding down. “We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good.” Trump offered no compromise, and you could see that some Democrats weren’t having it. “Ridiculous partisan investigations.” But there was one moment that broke the ice. “No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs.” The Democratic white wave rose and gave a rousing applause to themselves. “You weren’t supposed to do that. Thank you very much.” And finally to 2020. Trump addressed a House that had just impeached him for the first time. His souring relationship with Democrats was on full display as he refused to shake hands with the speaker. Trump used the address to kick off his re-election campaign. “Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, and we are never ever going back.” “The best is yet to come. Thank you.” When it was over, Speaker Pelosi’s message was clear. One year later, Trump supporters would attack the Capitol and threaten violence against Pelosi and Vice President Pence as they certified Joe Biden’s electoral victory.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="playlist-block"><div id="Washington"><p>Recent episodes in</p><!-- --> <p><span>Washington</span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
