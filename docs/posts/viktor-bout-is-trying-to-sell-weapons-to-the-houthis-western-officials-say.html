Hours later, Israel responded with what it said was an attack on the rocket launcher that had fired the projectiles.</p><div><p>At the same time, Israel said it was conducting “extensive” strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and the Dahiya, the densely packed cluster of neighborhoods adjoining Beirut. The skyline in Beirut has been thick with smoke after days of bombardment.</p><p>Israel said that it had sent more troops to Lebanon to join the invasion it launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-history.html" title="">last week to fight Hezbollah</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/07/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon/33eed647-d711-537c-a851-4127025d39e3?smid=url-share" title="">called on more residents</a> in the country’s south to evacuate.</p><p>The Israeli deployments and bombardments show how the fighting has broadened a year after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/06/world/israel-hamas-october-7-gaza-war" title="">the attack on Israel</a>, in which around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. In addition to its invasions of Lebanon and Gaza — where more than 40,000 people have been killed — Israel has also conducted airstrikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen in recent days, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to retaliate against Iran for its missile and drone attack on his country last Tuesday.</p><p>Hezbollah, which like Hamas and the Houthis is backed by Iran, began firing missiles and rockets across Israel’s northern border roughly a year ago in support of Hamas. But Israel expanded its campaign against Hezbollah last month with a wave of bombardments and assassinations, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-ground-invasion.html" title="">started a ground invasion</a> last week targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. At least 2,083 people have now been killed in Lebanon and nearly 10,000 wounded since the war began last October, according to Lebanon’s ministry of health, most of those over the last three weeks.</p><p>Israel also called on residents of large parts of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/07/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon/fc6dfe8e-1bcf-5de5-afb1-d9f87509ce72?smid=url-share" title="">northern Gaza</a> to evacuate. It says that Hamas’s main fighting units in the enclave have largely been destroyed, but it has continued its operations, seeking to eradicate any threat posed by the group and prevent it from reconstituting its forces.</p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Oct. 7 anniversary:</strong> Israelis are gathering to commemorate those killed and abducted a year ago, as Palestinians in Gaza continue to endure a war that has killed tens of thousands of people.

They do not address the questions raised by the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, about whether the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, may be guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their prosecution of the war in Gaza.</p><div><p>Instead, the documents challenge the court’s jurisdiction, arguing that Mr. Khan failed to provide sufficient notice of the scope of his inquiry or to give Israel time to show that it is capable of independently investigating the same matters. Under the treaty setting up the International Criminal Court, which Israel is not a party to, a case could be inadmissible in the court if it is already being or will be investigated by a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/state" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state</a> with <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jurisdiction" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jurisdiction</a> over it.</p><p>That means if Israel has the ability to conduct its own investigation into the actions underlying the accusations against Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant, the International Criminal Court in theory could give precedence to the country’s judicial system, allowing it the opportunity to address the claims.</p><p>In this case, Israel has argued that Mr. Khan did not provide enough information about what he was investigating, nor did he give Israel the chance to show it would inquire into the allegations itself.</p><p>“Despite having been forced into a bloody conflict that it did not want, Israel remains a democracy endowed with an independent judiciary and deeply committed to the rule of law,” the Israeli filing argued, adding that Israel “has the appropriate mechanisms” to ensure accountability for any alleged crimes.</p><p>In May, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/world/middleeast/icc-arrest-warrants-israel-hamas.html" title="">Mr. Khan sought arrest warrants</a> for Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant, and Israel is hoping to thwart or delay the issuance of the warrants. Mr. Khan also sought warrants for three Hamas leaders who were responsible for the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks that set off the war in Gaza — Yahya Sinwar, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-dead.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/muhammad-deif-hamas-death.html" title="">Muhammad Deif</a>. Of these three, only Mr. Sinwar is believed to still be alive.</p><p>Among other technical arguments rejecting the international court’s jurisdiction, Israel is now asking the I.C.C. to delay the request for arrest warrants for two of its top leaders until Mr. Khan provides more details about the scope of his investigation. And it wants the chance to show the court that it will address the accusations internally. </p><p>“Israel has primary jurisdiction and is best placed to investigate allegations of the sort raised by the Prosecutor, given the access required to relevant evidence, information and persons,” the Israeli submission argued.</p><p>The I.C.C. does have jurisdiction to proceed when a state is unable or unwilling to investigate accusations, or if the state inquiry is conducted in bad faith to protect the accused. And each situation is assessed on a case-by-case basis, so an Israeli inquiry wouldn’t necessarily preclude an I.C.C. prosecution going forward even if the court decides to grant Israel’s initial requests.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE1Yjk0NTU3LTc3ZGUtNTAzMi1hYjQxLTZiN2MzZTdlMmM4ZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/07/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#viktor-bout-houthis-weapons" data-source-id="100000009746896"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/valerie-hopkins"><img alt="Valerie Hopkins" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/23/reader-center/author-valerie-hopkins/author-valerie-hopkins-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/23/reader-center/author-valerie-hopkins/author-valerie-hopkins-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/23/reader-center/author-valerie-hopkins/author-valerie-hopkins-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julian-e-barnes"><img alt="Julian E.

Bout is trying to broker a deal with Houthi militants in Yemen, according to Western officials.</p><p>The negotiations between Mr. Bout and the Iran-backed group have been in progress for some time, but no deal has been completed and no arms have been transferred, the officials said.</p><div><p>Nicknamed the “Merchant of Death” by U.S. officials, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/brittney-griner-russia.html" title="">Mr. Bout was released</a> by the Biden administration in December 2022 after serving less than half of his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/world/viktor-bout-griner-prisoner-swap.html" title="">25-year sentence in U.S. federal prison</a> in connection to his work as an arms trader. The United States swapped him in the prisoner exchange that freed the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner from a Russian prison, where she had been held for 10 months after being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/magazine/nyt-interview-brittney-griner.html" title="">arrested at a Moscow airport with 0.7 grams of cannabis oil.</a></p><p>Freeing Mr. Bout was long a priority for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Western intelligence agencies do not have direct knowledge that the Russian leader told Mr. Bout to re-enter the arms trade, but officials said Mr. Bout would not have restarted his work without the implicit approval of the Kremlin. Had an arms deal with the Houthis been against Russia’s interests, they said, the Kremlin would have reined him in.</p><p>The Russians have been pursuing several weapons agreements with the Houthis, and Mr. Bout’s negotiations are not the only ones underway. Mr. Bout’s initial deal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/putins-merchant-of-death-is-back-in-the-arms-business-this-time-selling-to-the-houthis-10b7f521" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier in The Wall Street Journal</a>, was a potential agreement to transfer small arms to the Houthis. Western officials believe that other Russian officials and arms dealers are involved in potential agreements to send missiles to the Houthis from Russia.</p><p>More advanced and precise weaponry in the hands of the Houthis would allow them to target Israel more effectively and strike at ships in the Red Sea.</p><p>No arms or missiles had yet been transferred, Western officials said, but Mr. Bout is still coordinating his deal with the Houthis.</p><p>The officials believe the Kremlin is proceeding slowly and sending a message to the West with its negotiations with the Houthis. If Britain, France or the United States approves long-range missile strikes into Russia, Western officials said, the Kremlin is likely to complete the deal with the Houthis as part of an escalation strategy that seeks to apply pressure on the West without moving Russia closer to a direct war with the United States.</p><p>Mr. Bout has always denied accusations that he smuggles arms. The Kremlin and Mr. Bout both dismissed reports about the deal with the Houthis.</p><p>Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman said in a call with reporters on Monday morning that the reports were an example of “fake or informational attacks on our elected representatives.”</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/politics/07/10/2024/67039d6b9a794738efeb2e8a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview on Monday with RBC</a>, a Russian economic publication, Mr. Bout called the Wall Street Journal article a hoax but praised the Houthis, saying they had achieved results despite “insufficient resources.”</p><p>“They have, at least over the past year, shot down more than 10 American reconnaissance drones, and so all merchant ships that belong to the Americans or the Israelis have great difficulties passing through the Red Sea,” he said. </p><p>But Western officials believe Mr. Bout and the larger negotiations with the Houthis are part of a carefully calibrated effort to be ready to escalate tensions if the United States and its allies provide more support to Ukraine.</p><p>In addition to a stepped-up sabotage campaign in Europe, Russia is considering a broad campaign to assist groups like the Houthis and others challenging the United States and its allies if Washington removes restrictions on the use of American-made arms, Western officials said.</p><p>A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/us-ukraine-strikes.html" title="">U.S. intelligence report said</a> Mr. Putin was likely to retaliate with greater force if the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made weapons deep into Russia.</p><p>The assessment described many possible Russian responses to a decision to allow long-range strikes using U.S.- and European-supplied missiles, such as increased acts of arson and sabotage targeting facilities in Europe and potentially attacks on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/us-bases-alert-level-russia.html" title="">U.S. and European military bases</a>.</p><p>Mr. Bout, 57, was arrested in a U.S.-led sting operation in Thailand in 2008. He returned to Russia in December 2022 after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/us/politics/brittney-griner-prisoner-swap.html" title="">prisoner swap</a>. Four days after returning, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/10/world/europe/russia-bout-arms-dealing-politics.html" title="">joined the Kremlin-aligned, far-right Liberal Democratic Party</a>.
