That ads appeared anyway on YouTube ahead of falsehoods about Haitian migrants underscores the difficulty advertisers face in maintaining brand safety in an especially volatile election year.</p><p>Just this month, researchers discovered advertisements on YouTube for more than a dozen large organizations and consumer brands that monetized <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/technology/trump-dead-cats-migrants-ohio.html" title="">xenophobic</a> (and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/us/politics/don-jr-trump-haitian-migrants.html" title="">quickly debunked</a>) claims. Advertising dollars flowed both to YouTube and to the commentators it allowed to amplify inflammatory and racist narratives, according to a report by Eko, a group focused on corporate accountability.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The videos that were accompanied by the ads garnered nearly 1.6 million views on YouTube in a 72-hour period after former President Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/trump-debate-immigrants-pets.html" title="">promoted a falsehood</a> about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, during the presidential debate on Sept. 10, Eko found. The group estimated that the commentators likely earned a few thousand dollars collectively from the advertisements.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An ad for Adobe showed up alongside a video that claimed that “people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Eko</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Claire Atkin, a co-founder of Check My Ads, a digital advertising watchdog, said that tech platforms were infested this election season with conspiracy theories, false narratives and misinformation.</p><p>“We are dealing with information disorder, and advertisers can’t trust it,” she said.</p><p>A spokesman for YouTube said videos appearing on its site might be restricted from earning money if they had violated its <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“advertiser-friendly guidelines”</a> or other policies. The company said it had removed one video flagged by Eko for violating its policies about deceptive content and was reviewing others.</p><p>Adobe, the Harris campaign and Mazda did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Advertisers increasingly rely on algorithms that distribute ads automatically on YouTube and other websites. The practice has been <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/global-principles-information-integrity-press-release.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized by the United Nations</a> as “opaque” and the U. N. has called on tech companies to scale the practice back to avoid inadvertently funding disinformation or hate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Advertisements for companies that used digital advertising platforms were 10 times more likely to appear on misinformation websites than on those that did not use the technology: Nearly 80 percent of the most active advertisers relying on such tactics from 2019 to 2021 had ads that appeared on such sites, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07404-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report published in Nature</a> in June by researchers from Stanford and Carnegie Mellon.</p><p>Having an advertisement land next to misinformation can be financially damaging — the share of people who click on such ads is 46 percent lower than for ads that avoid being twinned with toxic content, according to <a href="https://integralads.com/insider/scaling-brand-surging-political-content-misinformation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Integral Ad Science</a>, a company focusing on brand safety.</p><p>YouTube is far from the only online platform that has sparked advertiser anxiety over the quality of its content. In 2020, more than 1,000 advertisers publicly joined <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/media/facebook-boycott.html" title="">a boycott of Facebook</a> that was organized by civil rights groups protesting the platform’s handling of hate speech and misinformation. Hundreds of advertisers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/technology/elon-musk-dealbook-advertisers.html" title="">left X last year</a> over similar concerns.</p><p>Now, <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/how-to-advertise-in-an-election-year/RES180622?categoryid=2826672" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a majority of marketing executives</a> are on edge, as heightened political tensions make consumers especially sensitive to how brands engage with political topics, according to a recent report from Forrester. Analysts at the research company called it “a seemingly no-win situation” for advertisers.</p><p>In interviews, many ad executives said they feel that YouTube and other tech platforms on which they advertise are not doing enough to protect against harmful content.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>YouTube banned or temporarily restricted a number of accounts after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/us/youtube-trump.html" title="">banning the account</a> of former president Donald J. Trump. The company appeared to walk back some of those restrictions in 2023 when it reinstated Mr. Trump’s account and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/02/business/youtube-election-misinformation-policy/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reversed a ban</a> on misinformation about the 2020 election. The video platform has also remained a prominent home for a number of right-wing commentators known for sharing misinformation. YouTube also has been accused of profiting from videos that presented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/technology/google-youtube-disinformation-climate-change.html" title="">climate change</a> as a hoax or exaggeration.</p><p>“Frankly, brands are promised a lot of things by the platforms — that platforms are using technology and human content moderators at scale to make sure this doesn’t happen,” said Harriet Kingaby, who co-founded and co-chairs the Conscious Advertising Network, a coalition of advertisers, technology providers and others. “There is a real sense that things aren’t working. The trust has been broken.”</p><p>Now, brands are trying to regain more control by dictating specifically where their ads can be placed and demanding more manual audits, Ms. Kingaby said.</p><p>YouTube says it allows companies to block ads from appearing alongside <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2454012?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3123061" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain creators</a>, on certain websites or appearing alongside <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12764663?hl=en&amp;sjid=18117531702020312527-NC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“sensitive content”</a> like disasters or graphic scenes of combat or war.</p><p>“Brands really do want to get it right in terms of appearing in places that are not just safe, but suitable,” Ms. Kingaby said. “But at the moment, it is a very, very, very difficult space to navigate.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tiffany Hsu reports on misinformation and disinformation and its origins, movement and consequences.
