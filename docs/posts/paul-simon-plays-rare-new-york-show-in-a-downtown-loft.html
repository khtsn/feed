He quickly added, “It’s not my birthday.” (He’ll be 83 in October).</p><p>Earlier, the venue’s runners escorted guests — including Whoopi Goldberg, Kevin Bacon, Amy Schumer, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld, and the musician Jackson Browne — in the updated freight elevator to the loft, a 3,500-square-foot fifth-floor space that was the original site of Chung King Studios, a former recording studio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Since December 2021, Nicole Rechter and Greg Williamson, two concert producers, have curated 14 Soho Sessions — private, mini-concerts raising funds and awareness for various causes, including mental health and gun control, and building community around the music.

Blue posters with QR codes hung around the room inviting guests to donate and learn about the research.</p><p>The walls were covered with photographs of musicians and performers by Danny Clinch, a guest, who was also photographing the performance. Candles burned along window sills and tables, and autumn-colored flowers and stalks filled large cylinder glass vases near charcuterie and cheeses by Murray’s Cheese.</p><p>Jay Sweet, the producer of the Newport Folk Festival, said Mr. Simon’s last large concert appearance was an “incredible” one at the festival in 2022. (Mr. Simon played an acoustic version of “Graceland” at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/us/politics/biden-state-dinner-japan.html" title="">White House state dinner</a> earlier this year).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This is a very rare performance,” said Mr. Williamson, who introduced Mr. Simon to fans, who had become pin-drop quiet.</p><p>During his set, Mr. Simon sat down, instead of standing as he once did, to better hear the music. He sang in dulcet tones, and switched between two Martin guitars. Accompanying him was Mark Stewart, playing a cello and a Petros guitar and coming in on vocals now and then.</p><p>He had other accompanists, too — Bernie Williams, the former New York Yankees center fielder, volunteered to whistle during a chorus of “Me and Julio.” Mr. Simon gave him a standing ovation and offered him $17 for the gig.</p><p>“That’s all I have,” Mr. Simon said with a shrug and a laugh. “The price is right.”</p><p>The audience pitched in with the “lie-la-lies and lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lies” chorus in “The Boxer.”</p><p>Mr. Simon also sang “Slip Slidin’ Away,” “Mother and Child Reunion” and “Homeward Bound.”</p><p>Fans — music insiders and performers, some who flew in and have listened to him for decades — were excited for the chance to see him perform live.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Simon, right, performs for a crowd of about 150, accompanied by the musician Mark Stewart. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-10"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A producer of the SoHo Sessions, Nicole Rechter, left, with the actor Kevin Bacon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The musician Jackson Browne.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I would walk anywhere, go anywhere to see him,” said Ms. Goldberg, who came from the Oranges in New Jersey with her grandson Mason Dean. “Paul’s music always represented home.”</p><p>Speaking of home, her favorite song is “America.” (Her grandson was partial to “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.”)</p><p>“‘Kodachrome’ takes me back to riding in the car with my dad through the Bronx going to see my grandparents,” said the actor Michael Imperioli, who starred in “The Sopranos” and lives on the Upper West Side. “His music is a reflection of life through a New York lens.”</p><p>Christopher Meloni, a star of “Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit,” who lives in Greenwich Village and has been to several Soho Sessions, said that the salon-style events reminded him of “S.N.L. in the beginning.” “I’m on the ground floor of what can be an iconic cultural happening,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Browne, the musician and songwriter, said his favorite album lately was “Seven Psalms,” which came to Mr. Simon in a dream.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“It’s meditative and somber,” he said, especially the song about a hitchhiker, “The Sacred Harp.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amy Schumer greeted Mr. Simon after the performance.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The actors Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay, who worked together on “Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.” </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Oh God, I couldn’t pick just one favorite,” said Mr. Seinfeld, who went to Queens College. “The one I hear the most is ‘Mrs. Robinson.’”</p><p>“Paul is an infusion of Queens beauty and sound,” he added. “I grew up in Long Island; born in Brooklyn. Queens felt right somehow. He captured the hopeful melancholy of Queens. I feel the sound of his music goes inside of you.”</p><p>Mr. Simon closed his set with “The Sound of Silence,” and then reflected on his own hearing loss.</p><p>“As you can imagine, and as probably some of you already know, it is really frustrating as a musician, devastating, not to be able to sort sounds out,” Mr. Simon said.</p><p>He then introduced Dr. Konstantina M. Stankovic, a professor and chair of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at Stanford Medicine, who discussed the study of hearing loss, as Mr. Simon stood off to the side by the audience.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>After Dr. Stankovic concluded her speech, members of the crowd rose from their seats, and the chatter returned.</p><p>Mr. Simon greeted fans as they approached.
