He said that two police officers were among the dead and that the authorities had made 71 arrests in connection with the violence.</p><p>The political unrest comes as the country is working to recover from a deadly storm. Mozambique’s death toll from Cyclone Chido has risen to 120 since the storm <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/11/weather/chido-map-path-tracker.html" title="">made landfall</a> more than a week ago, according to the country’s National Institute for Natural Disasters.</p><p>The storm’s death toll has nearly quadrupled from the initial reported figures as rescue workers reach isolated rural areas. Most of those who died in the storm were in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/africa/cyclone-chido-death-toll-mozambique.html" title="">northern Cabo Delgado Province</a>, where hundreds of thousands of people had already fled their homes after years of attacks by an Islamic State-backed insurgent group. The storm has affected more than 450,000 people in the country, the natural disaster institute said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since the protests that erupted after the country’s October election, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/10/29/mozambique-post-election-protests-violently-repressed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">human rights groups</a> have asserted that Mozambique’s security forces have responded with excessive force, including by firing live rounds and rubber bullets into crowds. More than 100 people have died in sporadic protests since the election was held.</p><p>Tensions escalated this week after the nation’s top court on Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/africa/mozambique-disputed-election-results-upheld-chapo.html" title="">upheld the result</a> of the election in favor of Daniel Chapo, the candidate for Frelimo, which has governed Mozambique since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
