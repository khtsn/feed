He said that two police officers were among the dead and that the authorities had made 71 arrests in connection with the violence.</p><p>The political unrest comes as the country is working to recover from a deadly storm. Mozambique’s death toll from Cyclone Chido has risen to 120 since the storm <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/11/weather/chido-map-path-tracker.html" title="">made landfall</a> more than a week ago, according to the country’s National Institute for Natural Disasters.</p><p>The storm’s death toll has nearly quadrupled from the initial reported figures as rescue workers reach isolated rural areas. Most of those who died in the storm were in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/africa/cyclone-chido-death-toll-mozambique.html" title="">northern Cabo Delgado Province</a>, where hundreds of thousands of people had already fled their homes after years of attacks by an Islamic State-backed insurgent group. The storm has affected more than 450,000 people in the country, the natural disaster institute said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since the protests that erupted after the country’s October election, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/10/29/mozambique-post-election-protests-violently-repressed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">human rights groups</a> have asserted that Mozambique’s security forces have responded with excessive force, including by firing live rounds and rubber bullets into crowds. More than 100 people have died in sporadic protests since the election was held.</p><p>Tensions escalated this week after the nation’s top court on Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/africa/mozambique-disputed-election-results-upheld-chapo.html" title="">upheld the result</a> of the election in favor of Daniel Chapo, the candidate for Frelimo, which has governed Mozambique since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975.</p><p>Protesters responded to the ruling by burning tires and blocking roads with trash and streetlights. Mr. Ronda said hundreds of buildings were looted and vandalized, including police stations, schools, hospitals, courts and homes. A penitentiary was attacked, and 86 inmates were released.</p><p>“These acts pose a direct threat to stability, public safety and the values of our young democracy,” Mr. Ronda said. “Defense and security forces must act firmly to restore normalcy and hold those responsible accountable.”</p><p>The top opposition candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, has asserted that he won the election. He has called for a national shutdown and for Mozambicans to take to the streets in protest. Mr. Mondlane said in a livestream on Tuesday that he was open to dialogue, “but only with international mediation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I will do what the people tell me to do,” he said. “I am with the people.”</p><p>Much of the anger stems from widespread irregularities in the election process — including voter registration and vote counting — that were identified by independent observers. Demonstrators argue that those irregularities helped to tip the poll in favor of Mr. Chapo and Frelimo.</p><p>Despite the concerns, the Constitutional Council, Mozambique’s highest court, certified the results on Monday, saying Mr. Chapo won 65 percent of the vote to Mr. Mondlane’s 24 percent. </p><p>In central Maputo, the capital, a large group of protesters surrounded a police car and heavily armed forces on Tuesday evening, demanding the release of protesters who had been detained for throwing objects at the police. Another group of protesters joined in. Outnumbered, the officers opened the back of the police car and freed two young men, to the cheers of many.</p><p>The chaos spells further problems for the troubled economy of Mozambique, a coastal nation of 33 million people.</p><p>The government was already struggling to address high unemployment and poverty, and an Islamic State-backed insurgency in the northern part of the country has left several thousand dead and derailed lucrative natural gas projects. Much of the nation is now shut down at a time when things are usually bustling with the festive holiday season. Several airlines have canceled flights to Maputo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The months of upheaval have also threatened stability across the region, and South Africa has sought to fortify its border with Mozambique to prevent any of the violence spilling over.</p><p>South Africa’s foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, traveled to Mozambique last week to meet with Mr. Ronda. They discussed ways to tackle disruption at the ports of entry between the countries, which has affected trade and supply chains and threatens food and energy security, <a href="https://dirco.gov.za/joint-media-statement-by-honourable-ronald-ozzy-lamola-minister-of-international-and-cooperation-for-the-republic-of-south-africa-and-honourable-pascoal-ronda-minister-of-interior-for-the-republic-of/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the South African government</a>.</p><p>“South Africa calls on all parties to commit to an urgent dialogue that will heal the country and set it on a new political and developmental trajectory,” South Africa’s foreign ministry said in a statement released on Tuesday.</p><p>Lynsey Chutel<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Eligon is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The Times, covering a wide range of events and trends that influence and shape the lives of ordinary people across southern Africa.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon">More about John Eligon</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Turning Allies Into Enemies: </strong>The United States killed its own allies in Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/afghanistan-allies-enemies-nuristan-taliban.html">sabotaging itself in a part of the country</a> where it never needed to be.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Drives Both Sides in Sudan’s War: </strong>Famine and ethnic cleansing stalk Sudan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/africa/sudan-gold-rush-heart-civil-war.html">Yet the gold trade is booming</a>, enriching generals and propelling the fight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reining In Argentina’s Inflation: </strong>President Javier Milei has been praised inside and outside Argentina for taming the world’s highest inflation rate. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html">But his policies have inflicted widespread hardship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nudging Japan Forward: </strong>In a society used to quiet consensus-building, Tokyo has made bold changes to its defense policy.
