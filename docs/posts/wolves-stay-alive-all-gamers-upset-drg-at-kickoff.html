</span> to earn a spot in the upper finals.</p>



<p>The two games on this gameday covered two opposite ends of the tournament, starting with an elimination match between Wolves and Nova. Wolves Esports earned its first win of the tournament in the upper bracket first round, but lost two consecutive matches to end up in lowers. Nova was in a different position, having yet to win a map in Kickoff after losing its first two matches to AG and TYLOO in sweeps.</p>

<p>Abyss started with both teams running variations of a Waylay and Veto composition, but Wolves struck first by winning the pistol. Nova prevented the bonus conversion, fighting back to take a 3-2 lead. Nova was able to pull together some consecutive rounds after some determination from Wolves to end the half with a 7-5 lead, but the second half was all Nova. Nova won the second pistol, converted the bonus, and ended the second half perfectly. Abyss ended 13-5, and Wolves needed a reverse sweep to stay alive at Kickoff.</p>

<p>Wolves then played on Haven, running a standard Haven comp with Neon, Killjoy, and double-Controller. Nova ran double-Duelist with Neon and Yoru, starting on the attack side. Wolves won the first pistol, and despite losing the bonus round, the team was coordinated in the retakes to extend the lead. The first half was highlighted by one of the best half-map performances in VCT China 2026, with <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> on Neon frying his opponents, ending with 20 kills.</p>

<p><em>Spring shoots four down against Nova Esports on Haven.</em></p>

<p>Just like how easily Nova ended Abyss, Wolves gave its opponents a taste of its own medicine with a second pistol win and bonus conversion to win Haven 13-3.</p>

<p>That left it all up to Pearl, with Wolves running a solo Yoru with double-Initiator while Nova ran Neon with double-Initiator instead. Wolves won the first pistol, but the first half was all Nova. <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/36670/obone">
		OBONE	</a>
</span> was doing it all on the defense side, ending the first half with 373 ACS. Nova led 9-3 at the half, and a pistol win to start the second half should have been the death knell for Wolves. </p>

<p>That was, until a massive eco round win flipped the momentum entirely for Wolves, staring down an 11-5 deficit and coming all the way back to win 13-11. It was <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/6022/yosemite">
		yosemite	</a>
</span> who was the star for the comeback win, securing the series 2-1 and eliminating Nova from Kickoff and Masters Santiago.</p>



<p>The second game moved the focus all the way to the upper semifinals, with All Gamers trying to keep up its form against DRG, who made it to Champions in 2025.</p>

<p>Starting on Corrode, DRG looked confident after winning the first pistol and converting the bonus round. It took until round seven for AG to win its first round, with <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/3741/vo0kashu">
		vo0kashu	</a>
</span> stepping up on the attack side as his team reached the half up 8-4. When DRG won its second pistol and converted its second bonus round of the map, that was curtains for map one. In the battle of Russian import stars in VCT China, vo0kashu and DRG took map one 13-7. </p>

<p>Bind started with both teams running double-Duelist, but with DRG running the surprise Reyna pick. It was a close start for Bind, as a DRG pistol win was only able to scrounge together a 7-5 lead at the half. The Reyna pick struggled on the attack side, but flourished on defense, even as AG found its rhythm and took the map to overtime. After one traded set of overtime, AG secured the second to win Blind 15-13 and take the series to map three.</p>

<p>That put the series all on Abyss, and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/58959/iamgrq">
		iamgrq	</a>
</span> moved to Waylay while <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/31753/spiritz1">
		SpiritZ1	</a>
</span> stuck on Reyna for the second map in a row. AG won the first pistol on Abyss, but the lack of a bonus conversion pulled DRG back in the game. It was SpiritZ1 who was stepping up for DRG, ending the first half with 13 kills and at a 6-6 tie. In the final half of the series, with the game tied, someone had to step up, and it was imgrq on the Waylay. </p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mGhnHL-tCo0?si=cnKosi-mf-oBfwCS&amp;clip=UgkxHTIBj2gXaRUzmL2X2Uwe8JOZxF91s2DP&amp;clipt=EKKt2AsY47_bCw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>iamgrq earns three kills to convert a late thrifty against DRG.</em></p>

<p>That performance delivered the 13-10 win for AG. Not only did AG complete the 2-1 upset win, but the team earned its spot in the upper finals, giving the team three chances to qualify for Masters Santiago.</p>
