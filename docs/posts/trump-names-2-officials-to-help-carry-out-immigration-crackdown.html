    <h1>Trump Names 2 Officials to Help Carry Out Immigration Crackdown</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Scott was at the center of some of Mr. Trump’s most contentious enforcement actions. When he was head of the San Diego Border Patrol sector, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/americas/tijuana-mexico-border.html" title="">agents fired tear gas</a> across the Mexican border at migrants moved toward the United States.</p><p>And he was in charge of the agency when Border Patrol agents were deployed to Portland, Ore., in 2020 to protect federal buildings during protests against police violence, but reports popped up of federal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/portland-protests.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">agents in riot gear</a> inside the city and away from federal property. Mr. Scott <a href="https://twitter.com/usbpchief/status/1286366628817575938" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushed back against</a> those reports.</p><p>He has criticized the Biden administration’s immigration policies consistently in news media appearances and was part of a group of former homeland security officials who wrote an open letter urging the public to vote for Mr. Trump.</p><p>“President Trump respected the experience of career border security professionals and listened to our advice,” the letter read. “When border security experts explained to President Trump how illegal immigration empowers the cartels to control who and what enters our home, he listened and acted.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also announced that Caleb Vitello, a longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, will run the agency in an acting capacity. ICE, which arrests, detains and deports unauthorized immigrants already inside the United States, has not had a Senate-confirmed leader in years.</p></div></div>
