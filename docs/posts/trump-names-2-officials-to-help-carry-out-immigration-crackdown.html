Scott, a former career border official whom Mr. Trump installed as chief of the Border Patrol in 2020, to run Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the country’s borders, including the Border Patrol.</p><p>In his announcement, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Scott for carrying out many of his signature policies in his first term, and credited him with achieving drops in immigration. “After retiring, Rodney has continued to educate politicians and the public about the importance of meaningful Border Security,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Scott ran the Border Patrol until 2021, when the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/us/politics/rodney-scott-immigration-trump.html" title="">forced him out</a>. He <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/border-patrol-chief-biden-wh-punished-him-critical-feedback-chose-retire-instead" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later told Fox News</a> that he was reassigned from the job as chief after speaking his mind to the Biden administration and later retired. He explained in the interview that he “gave feedback and I told them where I thought things were going to go wrong. And they did not listen to any of the advice we gave them whatsoever.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Scott was at the center of some of Mr. Trump’s most contentious enforcement actions. When he was head of the San Diego Border Patrol sector, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/americas/tijuana-mexico-border.html" title="">agents fired tear gas</a> across the Mexican border at migrants moved toward the United States.</p><p>And he was in charge of the agency when Border Patrol agents were deployed to Portland, Ore., in 2020 to protect federal buildings during protests against police violence, but reports popped up of federal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/portland-protests.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">agents in riot gear</a> inside the city and away from federal property. Mr. Scott <a href="https://twitter.com/usbpchief/status/1286366628817575938" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushed back against</a> those reports.</p><p>He has criticized the Biden administration’s immigration policies consistently in news media appearances and was part of a group of former homeland security officials who wrote an open letter urging the public to vote for Mr. Trump.</p><p>“President Trump respected the experience of career border security professionals and listened to our advice,” the letter read. “When border security experts explained to President Trump how illegal immigration empowers the cartels to control who and what enters our home, he listened and acted.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also announced that Caleb Vitello, a longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, will run the agency in an acting capacity. ICE, which arrests, detains and deports unauthorized immigrants already inside the United States, has not had a Senate-confirmed leader in years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Caleb’s exceptional leadership, extensive experience, and commitment to ICE’s mission make him an excellent choice to implement my efforts to enhance the safety and security of American communities who have been victimized by illegal alien crime,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media.</p><p>Mr. Vitello will be in a key position charged with overseeing Mr. Trump’s planned mass deportation efforts.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz">More about Hamed Aleaziz</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump’s Picks on Climate Change:</strong> President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet choices and key advisers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/climate/trump-cabinet-stefanik-zeldin-wright.html">run the gamut</a> from people who acknowledge the threat of climate change to those who deny it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Losing Faith in the N.R.A:</strong> Trump has “lost faith” in the gun organization, according to a top official at the troubled group, who argued in a letter that the N.R.A. needed to regroup so that it could help protect Republicans’ edge in Congress.</p></li><li><p><strong>D.E.A.
