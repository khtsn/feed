Then he looked up at a camera filming the scene from outside on Sunday and waved.</p><p>The video spread quickly. The hands belonged to the French first lady, Brigitte Macron.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Macron said that the video had captured him and his wife “bickering and rather, joking around,” something, he said, “we often do.”</p><p>“I’m surprised by it, it turns into some kind of global catastrophe where people are even coming up with theories to explain it,” he said on Monday. “It’s nonsense.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Macron, whose arrival in Vietnam marked the start of a five-day state trip to Southeast Asia, said it was the latest in a string of disinformation put out by “crazy people” targeting him in recent weeks. The footage was real, he said, but the interpretations were fake.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Mr. Macron traveled with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, on a train. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sz6cIACfB0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> of them showed a tissue lying on a table in their cabin, and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/factcheck-was-cocaine-on-the-table-in-macron-video-with-starmer-merz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some social media accounts described</a> it as a “bag of cocaine.”</p><p>The Élysée Palace, the president’s office, <a href="https://x.com/Elysee/status/1921676720995782761" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put out a rare social media post</a> at the time, stating, “When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation goes so far as to make a simple tissue look like drugs. This fake news is being spread by France’s enemies, both abroad and at home. We must remain vigilant against manipulation.”</p><p>Mr. Macron also cited a <a href="https://video.lefigaro.fr/figaro/video/les-images-siderantes-du-president-turc-retenant-le-doigt-demmanuel-macron-pendant-plusieurs-secondes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video of his lingering handshake</a> with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at a meeting in Tirana, Albania, as another example of disinformation.</p><p>“It’s been three weeks — if you look at the international agenda of the president of the French Republic, from Kyiv to Tirana to Hanoi, there are people who have watched the videos and believe that I shared a bag of cocaine, that I had a ‘mano a mano’ with a Turkish president and that right now I’m having a fight with my wife. None of this is true,” he told reporters on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“So everyone needs to calm down and focus on the real news.”</p><p>Still, the video lit up conservative talk show channels across France on Monday.</p><p>Ivan Rioufol, a right-wing political columnist, said the video clip implied “there may be domestic violence against men.”</p><p>The incident on the plane suggested that there was an imbalance in the relationship between Mr. Macron and his wife, Mr. Rioufol told the Europe 1 television channel. Mr. Macron “cannot even command respect from his wife when there are cameras in front of him,” Mr. Rioufol said.</p><p>Ségolène Le Stradic<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Catherine Porter is an international reporter for The Times, covering France.
