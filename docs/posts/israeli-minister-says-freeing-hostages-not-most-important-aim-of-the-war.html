Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have insisted they will not end the war before Hamas surrenders. Mr. Netanyahu has argued that “military pressure” will ultimately force the group to accept more favorable terms. </p><p>Mr. Smotrich’s remarks touched a nerve in Israel, where a no-one-left-behind ethos has long prompted the country to make difficult deals in exchange for the release of its captives. </p><p>In January, Israel agreed to a cease-fire with Hamas, during which more than 1,500 Palestinian prisoners were exchanged for 30 hostages and the bodies of eight more.<span>  </span></p><p>Since Israel ended the truce in mid-March, the families of Israeli hostages have been demanding an immediate agreement to release the remaining captives, even at the cost of ending the war and leaving Hamas in charge of Gaza.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>About two dozen living hostages and the bodies of more than 30 others are believed to still be in Gaza, according to Israeli officials. </p><p>The Hostages Families Forum, a group representing many of the relatives of the Israeli captives, said that the Israeli government under Mr. Netanyahu’s leadership, had “consciously decided to give up on the hostages.”</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Mr. Netanyahu’s office.</p><p>More than 36 hostages have died during the 18-month war in the Gaza Strip, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages.html" title="">some of them in Israeli airstrikes</a>. Hamas has continued to fight a dogged insurgency against Israel for well over a year despite heavy losses, leaving critics skeptical that the group can be destroyed completely. </p><p>In an address on Saturday night, Mr. Netanyahu said he would not end the war as long as Hamas ruled Gaza. He accused “elements in Israel” who wanted to end the war in order to bring back the hostages of “echoing Hamas propaganda word for word.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
