But they had not been battle-tested, leaving open the question of how well they would perform in actual combat.</p><p>In China, commentators declared that question now answered.</p><p>“Taiwanese experts say the Taiwanese military has no chance against the J-10C,” The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, crowed on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Chinese government has not directly confirmed the Pakistani claims, and India has not publicly confirmed losing any aircraft. But on Saturday, <a href="https://weibo.com/3266943013/5167319686317230" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China’s state broadcaster declared</a> on social media that J-10C jets had recently “achieved combat results for the first time,” with the post including a hashtag related to the India-Pakistan conflict.</p><p>Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese military, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/opinion/china-opinion/article/3310220/4-lessons-china-pakistan-j-10s-down-indian-rafale-jets?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in an op-ed</a> article that the jets’ success would boost Chinese confidence in future territorial disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea. </p><p>“The real effect is actually for the world, including Taiwanese authorities, to see how China’s defense industry has developed by leaps and bounds,” Mr. Zhou said in an interview. “This is for them to think about.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Xi Jinping, China’s leader, with President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan in Beijing in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Wu Hao</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Further stoking Chinese pride were reports that some of the Indian jets that Pakistan said it had downed were manufactured by France.

Pakistan claimed that the PL-15 missiles hit their targets, though India has said that they did not.</p><p>The Chinese military’s lack of real-world combat experience — it has not fought a war in more than 40 years — is a longstanding source of concern for some in Beijing. But China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has made modernizing the military a priority. China has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/asia/china-economy-congress.html" title="">increased its defense spending</a> even as economic growth has slowed, and it is now the fourth-largest arms exporter globally.</p><p>Chinese and Taiwanese analysts alike said the recent conflict suggested that Chinese weapons were now on par with Western ones.</p><p>“This is the most convincing appearance of the Chinese weapon system on the world stage ” Hu Xijin, former editor in chief of The Global Times, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hNW4c5H5NO3oZoOgD9wNSg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p><p>Mr. Hu added that the United States, having seen proof of China’s prowess, would be less likely to intervene on Taiwan’s behalf.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some in Taiwan have expressed similar concerns. Li Cheng-chieh, a retired major general in the Taiwanese military, said in an interview that the Pakistani air force’s experience suggested that Taiwanese planes would have “little chance of survival” against Chinese ones.</p><p>“Whether our fighter jets would even have the opportunity to take off is a question mark,” he said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chinese military aircraft at an exhibition in Zhuhai, China, last year.

State media did not confirm the use of the Chinese jets in the conflict until more than a week after Pakistan said it had successfully deployed them. </p><p>Beijing’s restraint may stem partly from wanting to avoid imperiling a recent diplomatic thaw with India. The two giants have in recent months agreed to resume direct flights and cooperate on trade issues, after their relations fell apart with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/18/world/asia/china-india-border-conflict.html" title="">deadly clash over a disputed land border</a> in 2020.</p><p>This month’s conflict may also have raised questions about other Chinese equipment even as it seemed to show off the strength of its fighter jets.
