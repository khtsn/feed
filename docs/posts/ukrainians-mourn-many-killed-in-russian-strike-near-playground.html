Serhii Smotolok, a 57-year-old welder, was nursing a beer nearby on the terrace of a restaurant, unwinding after his workday. Radislav Yatsko, 7, was sitting in the back seat of his parents’ car as they drove past the playground, headed home from an afternoon at their country cottage.</p><p>In an instant, the lively scene turned to carnage: A Russian missile struck near the playground, raining shrapnel that tore apart everything in its path.</p><p>Kostiantyn and his cousin were killed instantly, Kostiantyn’s leg torn off by the blast.

Two days before Friday’s strike, a missile killed four residents.</p><p>Amid the hardship, residents yearn for moments of joy.</p><p>When 16-year-old Kostiantyn asked his aunt and legal guardian, Liubov Svoroba, if he and his cousin could hang out with friends at the playground, she hesitated but eventually agreed. The two teenagers enjoyed escaping the shadows of war there, often working out on rudimentary, colorful sit-up benches and chest-press machines scattered across the sandy terrain.</p><p>“They said they just wanted to go for a walk and see their friends,” Ms. Svoroba, 65, said. “As soon as they got there, the explosion happened.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Serhii Smotolok was nursing a beer on the terrace of a nearby restaurant when the missile struck.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Olga Yaroshenko</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>From her apartment a few blocks away, Olga Yaroshenko, 66, saw a huge plume of smoke and dust rising from the playground. Her first thought was of her partner, Mr. Smotolok, the welder who was drinking beer at the restaurant. They had been together for eight years, finding love later in life. They were saving money for a new car — Mr. Smotolok’s dream.</p><p>As Ms. Yaroshenko rushed to the strike site, she saw the bodies of a woman, a teenager and several children, some already covered with blankets by medics. “The whole area looked like a field of corpses,” she recalled. “There were cries, screams — it was unbearable.”</p><p>In the chaos, she could not find Mr. Smotolok and clung to the hope that he had made it out safely. Then her phone rang, his number flashing on the screen. “I felt relief — ‘He must be alive!’” she recalled thinking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09kryvhi-rih-dispatch-5-lbjq/09kryvhi-rih-dispatch-5-lbjq-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09kryvhi-rih-dispatch-5-lbjq/09kryvhi-rih-dispatch-5-lbjq-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/09kryvhi-rih-dispatch-5-lbjq/09kryvhi-rih-dispatch-5-lbjq-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman with cropped hair is seated on a couch.

The United Nations, which sent a team to inspect the area, and the local authorities believe that Russia used an Iskander ballistic missile that exploded several meters above the park, showering the area with shrapnel.</p><p>Mr. Yatsko, Radislav’s father, said their family was so inseparable that he used to think if a missile or drone ever struck, they would all die together.

By Monday evening, the largest pile, nearly chest high, stood in the center of the playground, concealing a merry-go-round.</p><p>Ms. Yatsko said she longed for a life where children could run and play freely. “But for now,” she said, “even a children’s playground is not safe.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The playground on Sunday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Black Sea Cease-Fire: </strong>Ukrainian Navy officers and business owners in Odesa, a port city, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/europe/ukraine-russia-black-sea-truce.html">pondered what Kyiv could gain from a truce</a> after it pushed back Russian vessels and resumed commercial shipping.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Minerals Deal: </strong>In a major mining region of Ukraine, President Trump’s proposal to collect profits from mineral wealth is meeting a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/world/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-minerals.html">mix of skepticism and weary acceptance</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>P.O.W.s in Russia: </strong>Live drone footage allows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/russia-ukraine-pow-executions.html">Ukraine to observe what it views as war crimes</a> unfold in real time, soldiers say.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Partnership: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/29/world/europe/us-ukraine-military-war-wiesbaden.html">The untold story</a> of America’s hidden role in Ukrainian military operations against Russia’s invading armies.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Uneasy Discord:</strong> The split between Europe and the United States over how to end the war is exposing a new, disorienting reality for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/trump-europe-ukraine-russia.html">an alliance in trouble</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>L.G.B.T.Q.
