Trump announced that he would nominate Dr. Mehmet Oz, a longtime TV personality, to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a powerful role that would give him control over a more than $1 trillion budget and influence over drug price negotiations, medication coverage decisions, the Affordable Care Act and more.</p><p>Dr. Oz, a heart surgeon by training, first gained fame with appearances on “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” where Ms. Winfrey referred to him as “America’s doctor,” and shot to stardom with the debut of his own daytime program, “The Dr. Oz Show,” in 2009. On and off the screen, he has used his influence as one of the nation’s most recognizable doctors to champion healthy habits like a nutritious diet. But he has also sown misinformation — about Covid treatments, weight loss hacks and unproven supplements. He has invested in drug companies, even as he has publicly taken aim at Big Pharma, and has profited from a medical device that he helped invent but that has been subject to several recalls.</p><p>Over roughly two decades in the public eye, Dr. Oz has drawn the ire of medical experts, members of Congress and even his own peers, including a group of 10 doctors who called for him to be fired from a faculty position at Columbia University, arguing he had shown a “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/group-of-doctors-call-for-dr-oz-to-be-ousted-from-columbia-university/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disdain for science</a>.” (The university appeared <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/98539" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to quietly cut its public ties</a> with the physician in 2022.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dr. Oz did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>His nomination has alarmed some doctors and those who work in public health. “I just don’t know what side of Dr. Oz we’re going to see,” said Dr. Pieter Cohen, a physician and associate professor at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements. “I hope we see the meticulous cardiothoracic surgeon, and I hope we don’t see the promoter of unproven botanicals.”</p><p>Here are five key areas of Dr. Oz’s track record on health.</p><h2 id="link-1b0a7832">Weight Loss</h2><p>Dr. Oz has a long history of promoting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/us/politics/dr-oz-medical-advice.html" title="">dubious weight loss</a> products, including raspberry ketones, garcinia cambogia and green coffee bean extract, frequently extolling their “magic” or “miracle” ability to help people drop pounds. Many of these claims lack evidence or have been proved false.</p><p>In 2014, a Senate subcommittee grilled Dr. Oz about his endorsements of weight loss products, with Senator Claire McCaskill telling him that “the scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of a few products that you have called miracles.”</p><p>He admitted before that panel that his claims often “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/us/politics/dr-oz-medical-advice.html" title="">don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact</a>.” A few months later, the researchers behind a green coffee bean extract study Dr. Oz featured on his show <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/retraction-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-linear-dose-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DMSO" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">retracted the paper</a>. And in 2018, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/dr-oz-prescribes-5-25m-settlement-in-54820/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Oz reached a $5.25 million deal</a> in a lawsuit that accused him of exaggerating the benefits of weight loss supplements.</p><p>Some of his advice is more grounded in evidence: Dr. Oz has promoted exercise and diets that focus on lean proteins, fiber and healthy fats, and he has suggested staying away from <a href="https://www.oprah.com/health/dr-ozs-advice-to-lose-weight" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soft drinks</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He has also hailed the advent of drugs like Ozempic for weight loss. In a 2021 segment on his show, Dr. Oz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9BsGVQ7MSU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lugged a cinder block</a> around the set to illustrate the average amount of weight patients lost in a clinical trial. He has cautioned that there is not data on the long-term effects of these medications yet but has also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_oz/reel/CvvauSRJOXW/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed excitement</a> over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/20/well/live/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-diseases.html" title="">wide range of</a> conditions the drugs are being studied for, such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/24/well/eat/ozempic-side-effects-alcohol.html" title="">alcohol use disorder</a>.</p><p>His views may become especially relevant if he ends up at the helm of Medicare, which does not currently cover medications strictly for weight loss. Medicaid coverage for obesity drugs varies state by state.</p><h2 id="link-3be60516">Covid-19</h2><p>Early in the pandemic, Dr. Oz offered the public <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/dr-oz-tips-to-help-protect-yourself-from-coronavirus.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tips to avoid getting sick</a> and devoted time on his show to demonstrating how to wear a mask without <a href="https://www.facebook.com/droz/videos/235422871565841/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fogging up one’s glasses</a>.</p><p>But he also heavily promoted the malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine early on. He was in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-malaria-drug.html" title="">contact with advisers</a> to President Trump about accelerating the approval to use hydroxychloroquine against the coronavirus. At the time, the drugs had not been substantially tested against the virus. Scientists soon found those treatments were ineffective against it, and came with significant risks, including <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or#:~:text=Safety%20and%20Availability-,FDA%20cautions%20against%20use%20of%20hydroxychloroquine%20or%20chloroquine%20for%20COVID,risk%20of%20heart%20rhythm%20problems" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heart issues</a>.</p><p>Dr. Oz <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_oz/p/CJopDHogSD2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a video of himself</a> receiving the first dose of a Covid vaccine in January 2021 and said he “didn’t hesitate” to get the shot. But he has since criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2615105/dr-fauci-has-misled-us-dr-oz-decries-vaccine-and-mask-mandates/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">young people get booster shots</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He has pushed for a greater emphasis on treatments, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/health/covid-antibody-regeneron.html" title="">monoclonal antibody</a> infusions, instead of focusing on vaccination.</p><p>During his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/us/politics/dr-oz-senate-run-pennsylvania.html" title="">run for Senate</a> in Pennsylvania in 2022, Dr. Oz also seized on conservative ire over lockdowns and pandemic restrictions. “It’s not a healthy way to live!” he said in one <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr_oz/video/7057229437187951918" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TikTok video</a>.</p><h2 id="link-18c375a0">Routine Vaccinations</h2><p>As the leader of C.M.S., Dr. Oz would have oversight over the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act as well as programs offering low-cost health coverage and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">free vaccines</a> to children.</p><p>He has alternately <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0W25xL64yw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encouraged</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/5731513578001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people</a> to get vaccinated while also questioning certain vaccines and their schedules. “He has some attitudes that are strange and internally conflicting,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1258653034615647" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeared</a> on Dr. Oz’s show in 2021 to discuss Covid vaccines.</p><p>In 2010, Dr. Oz <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/joy/date/2010-01-04/segment/01" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the television host Joy Behar</a> that his children had not gotten flu or swine flu shots, and said that he spread out his children’s vaccines instead of following the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immunization schedule</a> widely recommended by medical experts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In 2019, Dr. Oz endorsed the M.M.R. vaccine, which is primarily given in childhood to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, on his show. Researchers found that people were <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/great-and-powerful-dr-oz-alternative-health-media-consumption-and-vaccine-views" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more likely</a> to view the vaccine as low risk after watching the episode than before.</p><p>But he has criticized vaccine mandates, particularly for Covid-19 shots. In 2022, he told The Washington Examiner that he would block private companies from mandating <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2615105/dr-fauci-has-misled-us-dr-oz-decries-vaccine-and-mask-mandates/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“invasive procedures, which a vaccine is</a>,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-6510dd9">Supplements</h2><p>In a 2014 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sk3k_rb8jI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">episode</a> of the Dr. Oz Show, the camera panned over a table with a tincture, some tea and a bottle of supplements.</p><p>“They were once considered fringe therapies,” Dr. Oz said. “Now, they’ve gone mainstream.”</p><p>He pointed to coenzyme <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/well/live/does-coenzyme-q10-reduce-statin-related-muscle-aches.html" title="">Q10</a>, a popular diet supplement, as a remedy for high blood pressure and suggested viewers try <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/well/mind/supplements-depression-anxiety-treatment.html" title="">Valerian root</a> to treat anxiety. There is some evidence to suggest that coenzyme Q10 might help reduce systolic blood pressure in certain patients, but experts have said more research is needed. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has said there’s <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/valerian" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not enough evidence</a> to show that Valerian root is helpful for anxiety.</p><p>Dr. Cohen appeared on the show several times more than a decade ago to discuss the health risks of taking untested supplements. He said he stopped making appearances after Dr. Oz started encouraging treatments that were not based on evidence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It was unfortunate, because his show started with such good advice and then it veered into misinformation,” Dr. Cohen said.</p><p>In recent years, Dr. Oz has continued to recommend supplements on his popular social media channels. In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_oz/reel/C6cg4jqJ07P/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a May Instagram post</a>, for example, he promoted nootropics — which include dietary supplements like fish oil — as a potential way to “maximize your brainpower so you can improve learning and productivity.” There isn’t <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/well/supplements-focus.html" title="">robust evidence</a> to support such a claim.</p><p>In 2023, Dr. Oz announced that he had become a “global adviser and stakeholder” of iHerb, an online supplement store. He has shared his own <a href="https://www.iherb.com/blog/dr-oz-personal-supplement-routine/1807?srsltid=AfmBOoqSHaLHrsp9YFEC9llx_xZYgYGihIHC2bhUSKIHEqETRKz3VNAp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personal supplement regimen</a> on its website, listing products like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/05/well/mind/ashwagandha-supplement-benefits.html" title="">ashwagandha</a>, a staple of Ayurvedic medicine. Dr. Oz said in the post that he took the supplement for thyroid health, but the <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-ashwagandha" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a> has cautioned that the product can exacerbate existing thyroid problems.</p><h2 id="link-13c90696">Ties to drug and device makers</h2><p>During his Senate run, Dr. Oz said that he had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/droz/videos/ive-taken-on-big-pharma-ive-gone-to-battle-with-big-tech-ive-gone-up-against-agr/587711448980183/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“taken on Big Pharma”</a> and had “scars to prove it.”</p><p>“I cannot be bought,” he added.</p><p>But his own history and financial disclosures from that run show that he has had financial ties to a number of medical companies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>One of these involves a medical device called MitraClip, which was designed to treat leaky heart valves and offered an alternative to open-heart surgery. A patent related to the device, initially developed by the Silicon Valley start-up Evalve, <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c5/29/3c/5acad7791c3217/US6269819.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lists Dr. Oz first</a> among the inventors, according to a report this year on MitraClip by the nonprofit news site KFF Health News.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration approved MitraClip in 2013. The agency had hesitations about the product’s effectiveness and the caliber of the research behind it, KFF Health News found, but chose to approve it for a narrow group of patients. Since then, versions of the device have been the subject of three recalls, <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm?id=NKM&amp;min_report_year=2009" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the F.D.A</a>. The agency has also received thousands of reports about malfunctions or patient injuries, including hundreds of deaths, that were potentially related to the device.</p><p>Dr. Oz’s <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Oz-Financial-Disclosure-Royalties-eFD_-Annual-Report-for-2022-Oz-Mehmet-C.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial disclosures from his Senate run</a> show that he received hundreds of thousands of dollars in MitraClip royalties from Abbott Laboratories, which acquired Evalve in 2009. In addition, the <a href="https://static.politico.com/37/49/989ab9d74460ac214c3610072fc1/efd-annual-report-for-2022-oz-mehmet-c.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disclosures showed</a> that he and his wife owned shares in a number of pharmaceutical companies, including, at one point, AbbVie; Johnson &amp; Johnson; Thermo Fisher Scientific, a supplier of lab equipment, instruments and chemicals, including hydroxychloroquine; and CVS Health Corporation.</p><p>Dr. Oz also listed holdings worth millions of dollars in Numilk, the maker of a plant-based alternative to milk; Prelude, a network of fertility clinics; and PanTheryx, a company specializing in products made with bovine colostrum.
