The ranch has passed through generations of Beutlers just north of Elk City, Okla., a community of about 11,000 people in the western part of the state.</p><p>Local news media this week reported that Bennie Beutler, who now owns and runs the ranch with his son Rhett Beutler, said that horses started to die last week in increasing numbers after being fed. “We put the feed out and we lost a couple,” Mr. Beutler said in an <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/66cfc42b9d1ce13382e19024/if-you-lose-one-its-too-dang-many-western-oklahoma-rodeo-company-loses-dozens-of-horses-blames-bad-feed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with News 9</a>, a local CBS affiliate, on Wednesday.</p><p>It was not immediately clear how many horses had died by Thursday, although some reports said at least 70 horses had died. The deaths “heart-broke us all,” Mr. Beutler told News 9. Some of the horses were mares whose foals will now be bottle-fed, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Thursday, the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry said in an emailed statement that it sent an inspector to the ranch on Monday after learning on Friday about the loss of the horses from an unnamed veterinarian who said there was a “potential issue with horses relating to feed.”</p><p>The inspector took a sample of the feed, which originated in Kansas, for testing, and the results are expected to be completed within weeks. The Kansas Department of Agriculture said on Thursday that it had started an investigation of the records and of the labeling and operating procedures of the feed company.</p><p>Kendra Santos, a media personality who writes about rodeos and is one of the hosts of the “<a href="https://www.nospinrodeo.com/2235479/15618907-ep-29-where-are-the-cowboys" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">No Spin Rodeo</a>” podcast<a href="https://www.nospinrodeo.com/2235479/15618907-ep-29-where-are-the-cowboys" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">,</a> in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kendrasantoscowboys" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook post on Wednesday</a> quoted Dr. Gregg Veneklasen, a Texas veterinarian who works with Beutler, as saying in an interview that the horse feed was contaminated with Monensin, an additive common in cattle feed but <a href="https://vetmed.tennessee.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/UTCVM_MonensinToxicityHorses.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that is toxic for horses.</a> The drug is an ionophore, or an antibiotic-like compound.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cattle feed on a ranch in Oklahoma, in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nick Oxford/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“The horror of so many dead horses — the death toll is now approaching 70 and counting, I’m told — is devastating a family-dynasty breeding program that’s a 95-year-old cowboy empire,” Ms. Santos wrote.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Dr. Veneklasen declined to comment when reached by phone on Thursday. Neither Bennie Beutler nor Rhett Beutler could be reached for comment on Thursday.</p><p>Most Monensin poisonings are not treatable and fatal. In 2014, feed tainted with Monensin was blamed for the deaths of at least four horses at an equestrian center in Florida, <a href="https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-general-news-511458b115b6487fbcfff0c8d1f45cb5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press reported</a> at the time.</p><p>Recalls of horse feed tainted with Monensin have taken place after fatalities of horses in <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2012-04-01/company-recalls-horse-feed-after-report-deaths" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2012</a> and <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2018-09-15/six-horses-killed-errant-drug-feed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2018</a>, sometimes after manufacturing equipment was not properly cleaned, according to the American Veterinary Medicine Association.</p><p>The <a href="https://swosuathletics.com/honors/hall-of-fame/bennie-beutler/5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beutlers’ sprawling legacy ranch</a> has deep roots in the rodeo community. Bennie and Rhett Beutler provide stock for up to 30 rodeo events a year, including in Arizona, Nebraska and Texas, and have contributed stock to the National Finals Rodeo for years.</p><p>After the deaths of the horses, other livestock contractors have rallied in support of the Beutlers ahead of the Elk City Rodeo of Champions, happening Friday through Sunday at the Beutler Brothers Arena, <a href="https://www.prorodeo.com/news/2024/8/27/general-fellow-stock-contractors-providing-helping-hand-to-beutler-son-rodeo-co" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The one silver lining I’ve seen so far is the heartwarming generosity of other stock contractors stepping up and offering their stock to the Beutlers,” Ms. Santos wrote.</p><p>On Thursday, Sammy Andrews, a third-generation rodeo stock contractor, loaded up 25 horses, bred to buck, from his ranch in Bagwell, Texas, to transport them to the Beutlers’ ranch to replace the horses the family had lost.</p><p>“The Beutlers go way back,” he said by telephone, trailer gates clanging in the background as he loaded his horses. “It’s plum devastating.”</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Food Safety Issues and How to Avoid Them</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Refreezing Food: </strong>Shuttling dishes and ingredients from fridge to freezer and back again can be totally fine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/freezer-food-safety.html">as long as you follow these guidelines</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.
