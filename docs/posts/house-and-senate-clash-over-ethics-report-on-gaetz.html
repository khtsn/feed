    <h1>House and Senate Clash Over Ethics Report on Gaetz</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Speaker Mike Johnson said today that he would object to the release of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/us/politics/johnson-gaetz-ethics-report.html" title="">damaging investigative report on the conduct of Matt Gaetz</a>, Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, calling the move a “terrible breach of protocol.” The House Ethics Committee had planned to vote this week on releasing the report, which focused on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/matt-gaetz-investigations-explainer.html" title="">allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use</a>. Gaetz resigned from Congress on Wednesday, halting the proceedings.</p><p>If the House declines to release the report, it could lead to a constitutional clash between the two chambers. The Senate is charged with vetting and confirming the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-administration-cabinet-appointees.html" title="">president’s nominees</a>. Senators in both parties have demanded to see the report.</p><p>Some of Trump’s other cabinet picks have faced pushback, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/pete-hegseth-defense-criticism.html" title="">Pete Hegseth, his choice for defense secretary</a>. Some military officials suggested he would be out of his depth running the Pentagon, and Hegseth was the subject of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/us/politics/trump-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-sexual-assault.html" title="">sexual assault complaint in 2017</a>.</p><p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick for health secretary, has also faced skepticism from both sides of the aisle. His vow to fight against Big Food <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/health/rfk-big-food-artificial-dyes-trump.html" title="">could face resistance</a> among Republicans. However, one Democratic governor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/15/us/trump-cabinet-live-updates/colorados-democratic-governor-praises-kennedy-then-has-to-explain-it?smid=url-share" title="">praised his nomination</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-350aa327">How nuclear power went from pariah to rising star</h2><p>For many years, climate negotiators saw nuclear energy as part of the problem, not the solution. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/climate/cop29-climate-nuclear-power.html" title="">That’s changing</a> as countries look to phase out fossil fuels while still meeting energy demands. During the past two U.N. climate conferences, more than two dozen countries, including the U.S., pledged to triple the world’s use of nuclear power by 2050.</p><p>Nuclear energy still has plenty of detractors, including environmentalists who point to the high costs and radioactive waste. But many politicians are eager to give it a second look: “I strongly believe that nuclear power is essential to meet climate goals,” the prime minister of the Czech Republic said this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert Roberson in prison in September.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Criminal Justice Reform Caucus Delaware County, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-6a28aa91">Execution can proceed in Texas’ ‘shaken baby’ case</h2><p>The Texas Supreme Court ruled today that state lawmakers overstepped last month when they halted the execution of Robert Roberson, who was sentenced to death for killing his 2-year-old daughter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/us/texas-roberson-execution-shaken-baby.html" title="">His execution can now be rescheduled</a>, but doing so will take at least three months. </p><p>Roberson’s conviction relied on a questionable diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.
