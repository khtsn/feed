But the magnitude of the dysfunction stunned investigators with the department’s inspector general’s office, which has made unannounced inspections to highlight shortcomings in funding, staffing and management.</p><p>Among the most alarming findings from an inspection in February: the unusual decision by the prison’s medical director to discontinue antidepressant medication for 15 inmates — without consulting or examining the patients. The omission violated bureau guidelines and put them at risk for depression and self-harm.</p><p>The medical staff also failed to provide inmates with basic care, tests and screening for colorectal cancer and diabetes, according to <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/24-113.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report on the inspection’s findings</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Investigators also found that corrections staff acted in grossly inappropriate ways — hanging framed Nazi-themed art from prisoners on the walls of staff-only areas, and scrawling sexual slurs targeting fellow employees, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, found.</p><p>“Our inspectors were very disturbed and surprised,” Mr. Horowitz said in an interview.</p><p>“The volume of inmates coming and going at Lewisburg poses extraordinary challenges for the institution’s leadership, and that’s exacerbated by the fact that they are substantially understaffed,” he added. “It just ripples through the institution — from the safety side, to the health care side.</p><p>The core problem, he said, is the bureau’s new but seriously flawed system for determining staffing levels at prisons. It is the centerpiece of a <a href="https://www.bop.gov/resources/news/pdfs/testimony-20231107.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reform effort</a> by the bureau’s director, Colette S. Peters, who has tried to bolster recruitment and retention of employees at a time when they can often find better-paying and less stressful work elsewhere.</p><p>That system, created by an outside contractor, severely underestimated the work force needed to provide basic security and services at an institution that serves as a transport hub for convicted felons from the Northeastern United States before they are sent to other institutions, investigators found.</p><p>At the time of the inspection, the prison employed only 191, or 78 percent, of the 245 correctional security positions budgeted for Lewisburg, a gap that was covered by the existing staff working hundreds of overtime shifts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The prison’s leaders told Mr. Horowitz’s team that they needed 265 employees to do the job. But the Bureau of Prisons’s staffing calculator tool placed that estimate at 197, roughly the staffing level logged during the inspection, which gave the false impression that Lewisburg was well staffed, investigators said.</p><p>In response to the report, Ms. Peters said her staff had worked to incorporate suggestions from the warden, and promised “to seek to resolve any outlier issues” that caused the Bureau of Prisons to underestimate the discrepancy between the staffing assessments.</p><p>Ms. Peters suggested that changes in the prison’s mission — from being a standard lockup to becoming a transport hub that houses most prisoners for no more than a week — might have contributed to some of the issues outlined in the report.</p><p>She praised the “employees’ ability to manage the changing and evolving missions of the institution.”</p><p>But many of the issues identified in the report revolved around the actions, rather than the number, of staff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>During the week of the inspection, the prison’s medical director cut off antidepressant medication for 15 prisoners out of concern that they might interact with other drugs the inmates were prescribed.</p><p>The director “did not meet with any of the affected inmates and instead relied solely on medical records,” in violation of policy and standard practice of weaning patients off such medication slowly to avoid “a major depression relapse,” investigators wrote.</p><p>Prison employees, speaking in confidential interviews with Mr. Horowitz’s team, reported instances of “verbal abuse toward inmates and employees.” They also described witnessing “multiple alleged instances of harassment” over the past several years.</p><p>Investigators quickly found visual verification of those claims.</p><p>“We observed multiple examples of obscene and sexually graphic graffiti, degrading certain employees, in employee-only-access areas and we observed derogatory language and images,” they wrote in the report.</p><p>Lewisburg employees also displayed inmate-drawn artwork, including Nazi and white-supremacist iconography — swastikas and badges for the Nazi paramilitary group Schutzstaffel — along with gang symbols in the hallway of a staff-only office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The graffiti and the artwork had “a negative impact on employee morale, inmates’ willingness to provide information to the B.O.P. during their gang disassociation, and potentially contribute to a hostile work environment,” investigators concluded.</p><p>Ms. Peters said the bureau was investigating the matter.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
