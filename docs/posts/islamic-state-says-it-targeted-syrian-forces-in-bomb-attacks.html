The man killed was accompanying the government forces, it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The two attacks claimed by ISIS took place in the southern province of Sweida, where the group has not been active for the best part of a decade. But the government has struggled to establish security in the province, which is effectively controlled by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/middleeast/syria-druse-alawites-kurds.html" title="">Druse minority</a>. Sectarian clashes between local militants and pro-government forces in the province killed more than 100 in late April and early May.</p><p>The Islamic State, which controlled large parts of Iraq and Syria a decade ago until U.S. and allied Syrian forces largely defeated it, has continued a low-level insurgency in eastern Syria since 2019. But it has shown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/syria-isis-prisoners.html" title="">a renewed vigor</a> since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/assad-regime-syria-final-days.html" title="">fall of the dictator Bashar al-Assad</a> in December, plotting attacks even in the capital, Damascus, and claiming responsibility for a car bombing among other attacks in eastern Syria.</p><p>The United States increased the numbers of its troops in Syria to 2,000 in the immediate aftermath of the removal of al-Assad’s government because of the threat of an ISIS resurgence. U.S. intelligence officials have said that the group could try to free some 9,000 of its followers detained in prisons in northeastern Syria, and seek to exploit divisions in the country and weaknesses in security of the new government.</p><p>Syrian government forces, working on intelligence provided by the United States, successfully thwarted eight attacks in Damascus in recent months, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/middleeast/syria-isis-prisoners.html" title="">U.S. officials have said</a>.</p><p>Among the plots averted was a plan to attack a Shiite shrine, according to Mouaz Moustafa, who leads the Syrian Emergency Task Force, an American nonprofit group working for democracy in Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The targeting of government forces with roadside bombs is a new development. It comes amid a campaign of heightened messaging in Islamist circles against President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html" title="">Ahmed al-Shara</a>, who formerly led a group affiliated with Al Qaeda but has publicly distanced himself from terrorist groups as he has sought international acceptance for himself and Syria.</p><p>The Islamic State labeled his government an “apostate regime” in its statement. Others have criticized Mr. al-Shara for not opposing Israel, and for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-syria-al-shara-sanctions.html" title="">meeting with President Trump</a>.</p><p>A prominent former Qaeda ideologue, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, in a statement distributed on jihadist chat groups last week, as reported by SITE, declared that Mr. al-Shara should be excommunicated for his failure to enforce Shariah law.</p><p>But Mr. al-Maqdisi advised against directly attacking Mr. al-Shara’s government unless the rebel groups were strong enough to overthrow the government, since, he said, small disruptive attacks would only play into the hands of enemies of Islam.</p><p>Reham Mourshed<!-- --> contributed reporting from Damascus, Syria.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Carlotta Gall is a senior correspondent, covering the war in Ukraine.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
