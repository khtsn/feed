He spent 10,000 Bitcoins, or roughly $40 at the time, in one of the first purchases ever made with the digital currency.</p><p>It has turned out to be the most expensive dinner in history.</p><p>On Wednesday, the price of a single Bitcoin rose to more than $100,000, a remarkable milestone for an experimental financial asset that had once been mocked as a sideshow and a fad. The total cost of those pizzas today: $1 billion.</p><p>Bitcoin now stands as arguably the most successful investment product of the last 20 years. The value of all the coins in circulation is $2 trillion, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than the combined worth</a> of Mastercard, Walmart and JPMorgan Chase. The motley assortment of hackers and political radicals who embraced Bitcoin when it was created by an anonymous coder in 2008 have become millionaires many times over. And the invention has spawned an entire industry anchored by publicly traded companies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/business/coinbase-crypto.html" title="">Coinbase</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange, and promoted by celebrities, athletes and Elon Musk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Even the president-elect says he is a believer. During the campaign, Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/technology/-crypto-influence-election.html" title="">marketed himself</a> as a Bitcoin enthusiast, vowing to create a federal stockpile that could push its price even higher.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="bitcoin-price" data-id="100000009836794" data-source-id="100000009836794"></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Bitcoin began as “essentially an experimental hobbyist project,” said Finn Brunton, the author of a 2019 <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179490/digital-cash?srsltid=AfmBOopB0e1z2JhpMHftDR1DaSSn27GFnvB8Lq2C5pdh5iSKzq4XSdGk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book</a> about the history of cryptocurrency. “To see where it is now is to see a really impressive feat.”</p><p>Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 signals its now-undeniable status in the global economic system. The virtual currency has become a staple of financial markets, embraced by Wall Street giants and amateur investors alike. Its surge also caps an astonishing turnaround after its price dropped below $17,000 in 2022, as the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange sent the industry into a tailspin.</p><p>This year, Bitcoin has come roaring back. Federal regulators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/technology/sec-bitcoin-approval-exchange-traded-funds.html" title="">allowed</a> Wall Street firms to offer a popular financial product tied to the coin, attracting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/technology/bitcoin-etf-trading.html" title="">billions of dollars</a> in fresh investment. Then, Mr. Trump’s election victory sent its price even higher, as crypto enthusiasts branded him the first “Bitcoin president.”</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/technology/gary-gensler-crypto-sec.html" title="">Gary Gensler</a>, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a crypto critic who had led a crackdown on the industry, said <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-182" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he would step down</a> on Jan. 20.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Trump picked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/trump-sec-paul-atkins.html" title="">Paul Atkins</a>, a former regulator and founder of a financial consulting firm, as the next S.E.C. leader. He has advised clients on crypto issues, and is seen as a strong advocate for looser regulation of the digital asset industry.</p><p>In a matter of months, Bitcoin investors went from bemoaning tough regulation under the Biden administration to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/time-for-a-new-lambo-swagger-returns-to-crypto-as-bitcoin-soars?sref=zVYYYI5e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shopping for Lamborghinis</a> and gloating on social media. Top crypto executives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/technology/crypto-industry-spending-election.html" title="">spent about $135 million</a> to influence the U.S. election, and they are now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/technology/trump-crypto-bitcoin.html" title="">enjoying the spoils</a>.</p><p>“There’s an enormous amount of excitement in the industry right now,” said Jeremy Allaire, the chief executive of Circle, an influential U.S. crypto company. “A lot of positive energy.”</p><p>Still, Bitcoin remains prone to extreme volatility. Its price sometimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/technology/bitcoin-ukraine-russia-roose.html" title="">drops</a> when the global economy struggles. Environmental groups have <a href="https://unu.edu/press-release/un-study-reveals-hidden-environmental-impacts-bitcoin-carbon-not-only-harmful-product" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised concerns</a> that the energy required to run Bitcoin’s software contributes to climate change, and the technology has long been used by scammers and thieves.</p><p>While some of that illicit activity has fallen off, cybercriminals used digital currencies to facilitate about $500 million in ransom payments over the first six months of the year, <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-mid-year-update-part-1/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the crypto forensics firm Chainalysis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Before it became a cultural and financial phenomenon, Bitcoin was just an idea sketched out in a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nine-page white paper</a> posted on an internet <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/satoshi-archive/emails/cryptography/1/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mailing list</a> on Halloween in 2008. The author was a mysterious coder who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. At its most basic, Satoshi’s vision was a type of digital money that people could exchange without relying on banks to process the transfers. Every transaction would be recorded on a publicly visible ledger known as a blockchain.</p><p>Early enthusiasts envisioned Bitcoin as the foundation for a new kind of financial system that would be governed by code and exist outside the supervision of Wall Street firms and government regulators. They also viewed Bitcoin as a long-term store of value — it was programmed to have a fixed supply, so it would be resistant to inflation.</p><p>The Wall Street establishment dismissed Bitcoin as a passing trend and a tool for criminals. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-crypto-ponzi-scheme-fraud-currency-blockchain-jpmorgan-2024-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> Bitcoin “a fraud” and a “Ponzi scheme.” Mr. Trump once decried it as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57392734" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“a scam”</a> designed to undermine the U.S. dollar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Free pizza is offered during the “Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day” ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in May 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>But believers thought Bitcoin might someday facilitate real-world transactions. On May 18, 2010, Mr. Hanyecz posted in a popular Bitcoin forum, offering to send 10,000 Bitcoins to anyone who ordered him pizza from Papa John’s. “Like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day,” he <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A deal was struck, and the event became known as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/22/happy-bitcoin-pizza-day/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin Pizza Day</a>. Over the next decade, Bitcoin inspired thousands of other digital currencies with names like Ether, Solana and Dogecoin, some of which also became enormously valuable.</p><p>In November 2021, Bitcoin’s price soared to nearly $70,000, setting a record. The crypto world was ascendant. Kim Kardashian encouraged her Instagram followers to buy the coins, and athletes like Tom Brady and Steph Curry promoted crypto companies in splashy television commercials.</p><p>Then the bubble burst. In 2022, FTX and other prominent crypto firms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/business/ftx-bankruptcy.html" title="">filed for bankruptcy</a>, causing the prices of Bitcoin and other digital assets to plummet by as much as 96 percent. Amateur investors who had poured money into crypto saw their savings vanish. In Washington, Mr. Gensler of the S.E.C. embarked on a wide-ranging clampdown.</p><p>But the industry’s fortunes changed again this year, after the S.E.C. lost a court battle to block a new financial product tied to Bitcoin. In January, major Wall Street firms, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/technology/bitcoin-etf-trading.html" title="">started offering</a> exchange-traded funds linked to Bitcoin, attracting a wave of investment. Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/technology/bitcoin-price-record-high.html" title="">another record</a> in March.</p><p>Wealthy investors who had held onto their Bitcoin became even richer. Michael Saylor, the chief executive of the software firm MicroStrategy, had been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-saylor-bet-billions-on-bitcoin-and-lost-11659538890" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">widely mocked</a> for borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to buy Bitcoin for his company. Now his <a href="https://x.com/saylor/status/1858496146026467378" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stash is worth</a> more than $30 billion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump proclaimed himself pro-Bitcoin, promising to fire Mr. Gensler and end the S.E.C.’s crackdown. A few weeks before the election, Mr. Trump and his sons started their own crypto business, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/donald-trump-crypto-2024-campaign.html" title="">World Liberty Financial</a>.</p><p>Suddenly, a financial asset designed to circumvent the U.S. government was surging in value because a U.S. presidential candidate had embraced it.</p><p>Bitcoin has risen in “exactly the opposite way that it was intended,” said Mr. Brunton, the crypto author. “By being something where its real value comes from its association with a politician and a state actor.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-15"></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Yaffe-Bellany writes about the crypto industry from San Francisco.
