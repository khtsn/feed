Trump’s speech on Wednesday in Asheville, N.C., his first event in a battleground state in nearly two weeks, was supposed to offer him a bit of a reset after his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, gained significant momentum.</p><p>His top advisers have urged him to focus on policy issues, and he vowed to about 2,000 people in an Asheville auditorium that he would do just that, giving a speech that he said would focus squarely on the economy and inflation.</p><p>But in a speech lasting more than an hour, Mr. Trump often veered far from that aim. He jeered President Biden over being pressured to exit the race, frequently criticized the Biden administration’s immigration policy, broadly attacked undocumented immigrants as criminals and lobbed a series of personal attacks at Ms. Harris, whom he claimed had been chosen after Democrats “decided to get politically correct.”</p><p>“Her laugh is career-threatening,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Harris, adding: “That’s a laugh of a person with some big problems.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Trump did spend considerable time discussing economic issues, largely reassigning to Ms. Harris attacks he has made for years against Mr. Biden over his inability to curb inflation and price increases. He argued that she had been in a position to address both issues but had not made significant progress.</p><p>“Just remember, she goes to work every morning in the West Wing,” Mr. Trump told the crowd. “Her desk is 10 steps from the Oval Office.”</p><p>He added: “For nearly four years, Kamala has cackled as the American economy has burned.”</p><p>Mr. Trump stood in front of signs referring to his proposals to end taxes on Social Security benefits and on tips for hospitality workers. He said of the economy, “They say it’s the most important subject.” But he added, “I think crime is right there. I think the border is right there. We have a lot of important subjects.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s remarks suggested the Trump campaign continues to suffer growing pains as it adjusts to a new opponent. At rallies and interviews in the past several weeks, Mr. Trump has frequently veered between his standard attacks on Mr. Biden and his attempts to find consistent and effective criticisms of Ms. Harris.</p><p>In Asheville, he seemed to acknowledge his campaign’s struggles to define her. “You don’t know who these people are,” he lamented of Ms. Harris and her running mate. “I think when people find out who they are, I personally don’t think they can do well in the election.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Earlier on Wednesday, his campaign blasted Ms. Harris in a statement for what it called “Kamalanomics,” an echo of the “Bidenomics” label it had derisively used against the president.</p><p>Both the statement and the speech came hours after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/cpi-inflation-july.html" title="">the release of a federal report</a> that found that inflation had cooled last month, with a key measure falling below 3 percent for the first time since 2021. The report offered further evidence that inflation is moderating. Still, polls have found that voters remain concerned about high prices, and the pace of price increases remains higher than its pre-pandemic norm.</p><p>Ms. Harris is expected to give <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/kamala-harris-economy-north-carolina.html" title="">an economy-focused speech on Friday</a> in Raleigh, N.C, where she will outline a reboot of the administration’s economic agenda. Mr. Trump, who knocked Ms. Harris for adopting a proposal that he had pushed to stop collecting taxes on tips, suggested she would likely copy his policies.</p><p>During his speech, Mr. Trump vowed that he would end “costly, job-killing” regulations in order to bring prices down, though he did not specify which regulations. He promised to address housing costs by opening large tracts of federal land for development, imposing tariffs of up to 20 percent on America’s trading partners and expanding signature tax cuts he pushed while in the White House.</p><p>He also said that his chief tool to fight rising prices would be boosting oil and gas production, even as the U.S. is currently producing significantly more crude oil today than it did under the Trump administration.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Yet even as Mr. Trump has knocked Ms. Harris for shifting political positions and making promises he says she does not intend to keep, Mr. Trump committed to “slashing energy and electricity prices by half” if elected, then almost immediately backed away from committing to that figure.</p><p>“If it doesn’t work out, you’ll say, ‘Oh well, I voted for him. I still got it down a lot,’” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump continued to attack both Ms. Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, as overly liberal. He repeatedly characterized the vice president as a “San Francisco liberal” and pointed to Mr. Walz’s signing of a bill that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/politics/trump-tim-walz-tampons-schools.html" title="">provided tampons in school bathrooms</a> for all students, including transgender ones — an issue that has little to do with his economic argument.</p><p>“They’re actually beyond socialists,” Mr. Trump said of the Democratic ticket. “I think they skipped over socialists.”</p><p>He accused Democrats of cheating in elections, a claim for which there is no evidence, and criticized them for being a “threat to democracy” when they replaced Mr. Biden as the nominee. He claimed Ms. Harris was “trying to throw him overboard,” even though she has remained supportive of the president.</p><p>The former president also flicked at a recent conspiratorial claim he has made that Mr. Biden might somehow disrupt the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago. “Let them have their convention, and who knows how that’s going to turn out,” Mr. Trump said. “Joe Biden is a very angry man. You know that, right?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Gold is a political correspondent for The Times covering the campaigns of Donald J.
