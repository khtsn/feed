Trump has always adapted to the media tool of the moment.</p><p>As a young mogul on the make, he made himself a fixture of the Manhattan tabloids, then pivoted to the newfangled realm of reality TV as master of NBC’s “The Apprentice.” He recognized the power of Twitter long before other politicians and, in 2016, used countless cable news interviews to propel his candidacy to victory.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris partly by, once again, adjusting to the new realities of mass communication. He bypassed traditional gatekeepers like “60 Minutes” on CBS in favor of the online celebrities and podcasts that have exploded in popularity, particularly among young men.</p><p>The personalities courted by Mr. Trump — Adin Ross, Theo Von, the Nelk Boys — may still be something of a mystery to the millions of Americans who rely on mainstream newscasts and celebrity anchors like Anderson Cooper.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Yet each of them was cited by name during the televised Trump victory celebrations early Wednesday. And the president-elect took a moment to single out a friend onstage: Bryson DeChambeau, a two-time U.S. Open golfing champion and YouTube star whose 56-minute video with Mr. Trump — in which the men called each other “partner” and traded tips on<strong> </strong>putting — amassed nearly 13 million views.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Nelk Boys were among the online influencers mentioned by Mr. Trump at his victory celebration on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle Groskopf for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The golfer Bryson DeChambeau, center, appeared with Mr. Trump in a 56-minute video that amassed nearly 13 million views.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“He’s always looking to the next venue that’s best suited to his instincts for generating support,” said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News who is now an adviser to several local newsrooms. <em>“</em>It’s part of Trump’s extraordinary record of instinctively finding ways to viscerally connect with voters.”</p><p>“He’s a master of evolving media,” Mr. Heyward added.</p><p>Frank, free-flowing and fratty, these nontraditional venues lent themselves to Mr. Trump’s circuitous and colloquial way of speaking.</p><p>They also presented a way for Mr. Trump to sidestep more confrontational interviews with professional journalists, where he might face tough questions, fact-checks and detailed policy debates. The influencers he met with rarely challenged Mr. Trump, and often lavished him with praise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Trump referred to mainstream news outlets as the “enemy camp.” In 2016, he often engaged with those organizations, frequently calling in to shows like “Morning Joe” and CNN’s “New Day” to field questions.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump in a Fox News interview in 2020.

Mr. Trump took advantage of that. He declined to participate in a second debate with Ms. Harris, and then pulled out of a planned interview with “60 Minutes,” the country’s most popular news program, which has hosted the two major-party candidates since the late 1960s. Mr. Trump’s team complained that CBS wanted to fact-check his interview, the kind of basic accountability that is often absent from podcasts that are focused on entertainment.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s recent approach to media tracks the shifting ways that Americans consume news.<em> </em>A recent Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/social-media-and-news-fact-sheet/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> found that more than half of adults sometimes get news from social media. Facebook and YouTube outpace other social media platforms as news sources, and Instagram and TikTok have seen gains over the last four years, the study said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>And, last month, trust in traditional mass media reached a new low, Gallup <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p><p>When Mr. Trump began showing up on podcasts, it was viewed as an oddity in the context of a presidential campaign. His first conversation in June, with the online star and wrestler Logan Paul, swerved from boxing to immigration to the possible existence of extraterrestrial life. (Mr. Trump has credited his 18-year-old son, Barron, with recommending that he speak with Mr. Paul.) In August, Mr. Trump met with Mr. Ross, a prominent gamer on a streaming platform called Kick who gave the former president a Tesla Cybertruck as a gift.</p><p>Later, Ms. Harris, whose campaign began much later in the year, made the podcast rounds, too. Her appearance on “Call Her Daddy,” a popular podcast with millennial and Gen Z women, prompted a “Saturday Night Live” parody and headlines for Ms. Harris’s remarks on abortion rights.</p><p>Ms. Harris, though, was not as aggressive as her opponent in courting the stars of the podcast realm. Her team discussed an appearance on Joe Rogan’s hugely popular show, but it did not come to pass. Mr. Trump spent three hours chitchatting with Mr. Rogan, who ultimately issued a last-minute endorsement of the Republican.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s April YouTube episode with the wrestler Logan Paul garnered nearly seven million views.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The podcaster Joe Rogan endorsed Mr. Trump.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott McIntyre for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>In October, Mr. Trump appeared on “Bussin’ With the Boys,” a Barstool Sports podcast hosted by two former National Football League players. He explained why he was interested in pursuing so many podcast interviews this election cycle: “It’s a young world,” he said. “You’re in a young world, right?”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It’s changing, you know?” Mr. Trump added later. “It changes very fast.”</p><p>Even as Mr. Trump has adapted to new mediums, he has maintained a habit of describing viral sensations in old-fashioned ways.</p><p>After his 53-minute appearance on Mr. Paul’s podcast, “Impaulsive,” Mr. Trump praised the host and said, “Oh, they’re going to get big ratings on this show.”</p><p>Podcasts are not measured by traditional Nielsen ratings, Mr. Trump’s preferred metric during his “Apprentice” days. But his episode with Mr. Paul was indeed a hit, garnering nearly seven million views on YouTube — far higher than any other podcast episode Mr. Paul has done this year.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
