The Delta flight landed safely at its destination in Minneapolis.</p><p>“Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people,” Delta Air Lines said in a statement. “That’s why the flight crew followed procedures to maneuver the aircraft as instructed.”</p><p>The Air Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>This latest incident comes two months after American Airlines Flight 5342 collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission, killing 67 people aboard both aircraft.</p><p>Since then, military operations near commercial airports have faced intense scrutiny from Congress and the Trump administration. On Thursday, members of a Senate subcommittee questioned the F.A.A. administrator and the U.S. Army’s director of aviation during an investigative hearing into the January midair collision about the practices that have allowed military aircraft to frequently fly too close to commercial airplanes at National Airport.</p><p>Since the fatal collision, the F.A.A. closed the helicopter route involved and ordered that aircraft operating near National Airport broadcast their positions, allowing air traffic controllers to better manage traffic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The National Transportation Safety Board recently disclosed that between 2021 and 2024, more than 15,000 close calls occurred at the National Airport between commercial airplanes and helicopters.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Walker is an investigative reporter focused on transportation.
