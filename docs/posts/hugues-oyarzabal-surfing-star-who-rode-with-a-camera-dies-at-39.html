He was 39.</p><p>His parents, Charles and Lucette Oyarzabal, said he had taken his own life. Friends told The New York Times that Oyarzabal had lived with bipolar disorder from childhood.</p><p>“His physical and psychological suffering took its toll,” his parents told The Times through a translator. “He has chosen to leave us, to rediscover the peace and serenity he has been unable to find over the last few years.”</p><p>Oyarzabal surfed some of the most challenging waves in the world, from the Basque coasts of northern Spain and southwestern France to Southern Africa and beyond. In his later years, he found what he called “a second home” in Indonesia, spending part of every year there and seeking out spots that had rarely, if ever, been surfed, notably at <a href="https://thesurfatlas.com/surfing-indonesia/desert-point-surf/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Desert Point</a>, on Lombok island, east of Bali, and at <a href="https://www.surfindonesia.com/bali-surf-spots/uluwatu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Uluwatu</a>, on the Bukit Peninsula.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He also made acclaimed surfing documentaries, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g0tQzTJVvQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Peace and Left,”</a> a multipart series, its title referring to a “left-hand wave,” one that breaks to the left from a surfer’s perspective.</p><p>Oyarzabal began videotaping his surfing exploits in 2001, as a teenager, using a Mini-DV camcorder in a waterproof box attached to his board. He captured images of himself riding through “tubes” or “barrels” — the tunnels of air created inside cresting waves, which the greatest surfers can ride in for hundreds of yards.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/22/multimedia/17Oyarzabal--cwlz-print1/17Oyarzabal--cwlz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/22/multimedia/17Oyarzabal--cwlz-print1/17Oyarzabal--cwlz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/22/multimedia/17Oyarzabal--cwlz-print1/17Oyarzabal--cwlz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="He is shown riding a surfboard inside the tunnellike curl of a wave.

Oyarzabal is thought to be the first surfer to create a device that clamped a camera to his teeth, affording the most direct point of view of a surfer.</p><p>His surfing friends variously described him as idiosyncratic, unpredictable, manic, lovable and loyal.</p><p>Hugues Oyarzabal (roughly pronounced OO-geh oy-ar-ZAH-bahl) was born on March 7, 1985, in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, a fishing port in the Basque region of southwestern France. He grew up in the village of Biriatou, on the French side of the river Bidassoa. When he began surfing in Indonesia, he added another first name, Waian (Balinese for “firstborn son”). It led to his logo, WHO (for Waian Hugues Oyarzabal), which he used on his website and in photographs.</p><p>At elementary school in Biriatou, Hugues excelled at tennis and paleta, a court sport similar to pelota, in which a leather bat or glove is used to smack a ball against a wall. But at age 11 he fell in love with surfing, starting in the Bay of Biscay on the Basque coast. During high school in Hendaye, near his home, he surfed some of the most formidable waves off Basque beaches.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Oyarzabal was so consumed with surfing as a youth that he left school at 16 to pursue his passion in Australia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Oyarzabal family</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>One beach, Belharra, on the French Basque coast, was the scene of rare but violent waves that were considered unsurfable, known to have swallowed up many a fishing boat. But Oyarzabal took on the challenge and succeeded. (The surf was later calmed by a breakwater.)</p><p>His passion for surfing became so consuming that he left school at 16 and, financed by his understanding parents, moved to the Sunshine Coast of Australia to enroll in a sports and education program under a private coach, who improved his surfing and his English. For the rest of his life, Oyarzabal considered himself a so-called freesurfer, unbound by the need to compete and instead content to be at one with the waves, performing unique feats that became famous among the global surfing community.</p><p>“I’m always looking to try different things,” he told the Britain-based Surf Europe magazine in 2006. “I hate the idea of having a surf routine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Oyarzabal with his daughter, Kailani, in 2020.
