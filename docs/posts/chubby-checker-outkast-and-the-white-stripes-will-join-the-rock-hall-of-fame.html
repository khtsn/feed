He is joined by Joe Cocker, the White Stripes, Outkast, Cyndi Lauper, Bad Company and Soundgarden, the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Foundation announced on Sunday evening, after a Rock Hall-themed segment on ABC’s “American Idol.”</p><p>Those artists — a lineup that mixes classic rock, hip-hop, 1990s-vintage alternative rock and a female pop icon — will formally join the hall on Nov. 8 in a ceremony at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles that will stream live in Disney+.</p><p>Checker, Cocker, Outkast and Bad Company were all accepted on their first nomination.</p><p>The induction of the White Stripes, the stylish garage-rock minimalists whose “Seven Nation Army” has become a stadium-rousing standard, could lend some anticipatory drama to this year’s ceremony. Since the band broke up in 2011, Meg White, its drummer, has become one the great recluses of 21st-century pop, rarely seen in public and <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a43846386/meg-white-interview-2023/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declining all interview requests</a> — which would make any possible appearance by her a major coup for the Rock Hall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Among the other honors this year, Salt-N-Pepa, the pioneering female rap group, and the singer-songwriter Warren Zevon will receive the musical influence award. The musical excellence citation will go to the keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, the studio bassist Carol Kaye and the producer Thom Bell, a key figure in Philadelphia soul. Lenny Waronker, a producer and longtime executive at Warner Bros. Records, will receive the Ahmet Ertegun Award.</p><p>Among the nominees who failed to make the final cut this year are Oasis, the Britpop standard-bearers who have reunited for perhaps this year’s most in-demand world tour, and Phish, the veteran Vermont jam band. Phish won the hall’s fan ballot — a single vote, entered alongside those submitted from the hall’s voting body of more than 1,000 music historians, industry professionals and previously inducted artists.</p><p>Other nominees who didn’t make the cut include Mariah Carey, the Black Crowes, Billy Idol, the Mexican rock band Maná and the linked British groups Joy Division and New Order.</p><p>The Rock Hall has come under close scrutiny over the makeup of its inductee classes, receiving particularly harsh commentary over its low numbers of women; as of 2023, women made up just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/arts/music/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-john-sykes.html" title="">8.8 percent</a> of inducted individuals, according to one scholar’s count. The hall has pledged to address those disparities, even revising its <a href="https://rockhall.com/mission/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">definition</a> of rock ’n’ roll as “a spirit that is inclusive and ever-changing.”</p><p>After some gains in recent years — with lauded inductions of Janet Jackson, Sheryl Crow, the Go-Go’s and Kate Bush — the latest crop of performer inductees may draw more complaints. It includes just two women: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/arts/music/cyndi-lauper-tour-documentary.html" title="">Lauper</a>, who rose to fame in the 1980s with hits like “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” and “Time After Time,” and Meg White of the White Stripes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Artists become eligible for nomination to the hall 25 years after the release of their first recording.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
