Hospital officials told local news media that at least four civilians had died from bullet wounds, with more than 50 others being treated for various injuries in two government hospitals.</p><p>At a news conference Tuesday night, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar denied that police had opened fire on protesters.</p><p>The police had earlier used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators, who pressed toward a public square near major government offices where they planned to hold a rally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>People in the crowd dismantled roadblocks that had been put in place to stop them while patriotic songs blared from vehicles. Some danced in front of the slow-moving convoy, some chanting, “Revolution! Revolution!”</p><p>When they reached the square in late afternoon, some chanted the slogan “Prisoner Number 804” — a reference to Mr. Khan — while others climbed atop shipping containers that had been set up to block their advance.</p><p>Mr. Khan, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/world/asia/pakistan-imran-khan-social-media-elections.html" title="">enormously popular politician and former cricket star</a> who has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/05/world/asia/imran-khan-pakistan-arrested.html" title="">jailed since August 2023</a>, had called for the demonstration over the weekend. He accuses the government and the military of conspiring to crush his party and undermine democracy, including by rigging elections. He has also criticized recent legal changes that limit the power of Pakistan’s judiciary, arguing that they are meant to keep him out of power.</p><p>The government, which says the charges against Mr. Khan are legitimate, depicts him as a figure who is unwilling to follow the rule of law and has accused him of causing chaos through his protests.</p><p>Pakistan’s government put the Islamabad on lockdown last weekend, blocking major highways and suspending cellular and internet services in several areas. But protesters managed to enter the city on Monday night.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Security officials said on Tuesday that the army had been deployed to secure important government sites and that troops had been ordered to shoot if needed.</p><p>Officials also said that four paramilitary troops had been killed overnight by protesters who ran over them with a vehicle. Mr. Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or P.T.I., denied that accusation. Two police officers were reported to have been killed in earlier violence.</p><p>Several journalists were attacked by protesters on Tuesday. A photographer for The Associated Press was assaulted and his vehicle was damaged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A crowd of people, with two shipping containers in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/26/multimedia/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq/26pakistan-protests-01-jhbq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/184dd374-870b-5791-81b2-8085973e3d2a" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters moved shipping containers that the authorities had put in place to stop their advance to the heart of the capital. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anjum Naveed/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Khan, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/asia/imran-khan-pakistan-ousted.html" title="">ousted as prime minister in 2022</a>, was arrested last year on various corruption charges, which he and his supporters say were politically motivated attempts to sideline him after he began publicly criticizing the military. But Mr. Khan’s popularity has not diminished, and he has been able to mobilize other large protests from prison. Tensions between Mr. Khan and the military heightened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/10/world/asia/pakistan-election-imran-khan.html" title="">after this year’s elections</a>, which P.T.I. claims were rigged against it.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, is leading the latest protest, having earlier spearheaded a large rally in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, which is controlled by Mr. Khan’s party.
