DirecTV argued that Disney was shortchanging its traditional TV customers by expecting the same fees for what is effectively less content.</p><p>Under the terms of the new agreement, Disney’s streaming services, including Disney+, will be offered to DirecTV customers in select packages. That compromise has now become common in cable deals, with similar agreements reached by the cable giant Charter with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery.</p><p>The dispute between DirecTV and Disney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/business/media/directv-disney-dispute.html" title="">underscored the harsh economic realities</a> experienced by satellite TV networks, which do not have products like broadband internet that make their services harder to abandon.</p><p>The deal will also allow DirecTV customers to watch the Disney Channel, Freeform, the FX networks and the National Geographic channels. Though the contract is still being finalized, service was restored on Saturday morning to DirecTV customers.</p><p>DirecTV’s agreement with Disney comes amid reports that the company is working on a much larger deal that would transform the company. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that DirecTV is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-13/directv-dish-are-in-talks-again-to-merge-satellite-tv-businesses" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">negotiating a merger</a> with Dish, another TV provider, in a deal that would create a satellite TV giant.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>26</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Disney and DirecTV Agree, Ending ABC/ESPN Blackout<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Media Industry</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>DirecTV:</strong> While the cable TV business is declining quickly, satellite TV is decaying even faster. ​The unforgiving economic reality has been thrown into sharp relief by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/business/media/directv-disney-dispute.html">a bitter dispute</a> between DirecTV and Disney.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Spectator Magazine:</strong> Paul Marshall, a multimillionaire founder and investor in upstart conservative media outlets, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/world/europe/spectator-paul-marshall-telegraph.html">bought the right-wing British magazine</a> in a deal worth about $131 million.</p></li><li><p><strong>Univision:</strong> Jorge Ramos, who is among the most recognized journalists in Spanish-language television, will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/jorge-ramos-univision-departure.html">leave Univision after 40 years at the network</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Insider:</strong> Business Insider named Jamie Heller, the business editor of The Wall Street Journal, to lead its newsroom as its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/media/business-insider-jamie-heller.html">next editor in chief</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disney:</strong> The inside story of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/business/media/disney-bob-iger-chapek.html">how Bob Iger undermined and outmaneuvered Bob Chapek</a>, his chosen successor, and returned to power at Disney.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
