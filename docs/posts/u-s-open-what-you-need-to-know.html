But for two weeks late in the summer, the place becomes the center of the tennis world as thousands of fans flock to Flushing Meadows for the U.S. Open.</p><p>Qualifying matches are already underway, and the main draw of the U.S. Open begins on Aug. 26. The Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon Championships and the Olympics are in the books, so this is the last chance for the world’s top tennis players to win a major title this year.</p><p>A few are favored to win this year, but the U.S. Open has been known for upsets, thrilling matches that can run late into the night.</p></div></div><div><p>Here’s what to know about this year’s tournament.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Riders on the No. 7 train pass the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriela Bhaskar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-75f72522">All aboard the No. 7 train.</h2><p>From Manhattan, one of the simplest — and fastest — ways to travel to the U.S. Open is by taking an eastbound No. 7 subway train to the Mets-Willets Point station. Once you’re there, just follow the crowds to the tennis grounds.</p><p>Those in Long Island or Manhattan can also take Long Island Rail Road to Mets-Willet Point. The Port Washington Branch departs Manhattan from Penn Station, with a stop at Grand Central Terminal.</p><p>Ride-share services like Lyft and Uber are also an option. But unless you’re staying nearby, traffic can make that a lengthy, pricey trip. Ride-shares can also charge surge-prices or get caught in congested drop-off zones. And waiting for a vehicle to reach the pickup area after the matches can take time.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans walk into the Billie Jean King National Center in Flushing Meadows, where the U.S. Open is held.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriela Bhaskar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-3779a94b">Looking for tickets?</h2><p>For the casual tennis fan, one of the best approaches to the U.S. Open is to buy a grounds pass during the first week. A grounds pass ticket does not guarantee admission to the main stadiums (Arthur Ashe or Louis Armstrong Stadiums), but the first week of the tournament offers plenty of early-round matches on the outer courts, where fans can bounce from match to match.</p></div></div><div><div><p>This year, the tournament will also offer expanded grounds passes for a fan fest the weekend of the finals, including watch parties inside Louis Armstrong Stadium.</p><p>The biggest names typically play inside Arthur Ashe or Louis Armstrong Stadiums, but be warned that tickets for those courts can be costly.</p><p>Pro tip: For those who don’t have a ticket for matches inside the main stadiums, plop down by the fountain just south of Arthur Ashe, where fans can watch matches on large screens set up outside.</p><p>The main draw begins on Aug. 26, but fan week, which started on Aug. 19 and includes the qualifying matches before the main draw, is free and open to the public.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans enjoy pizza and beers in the food court on the ground of the U.S. Open. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-13c716a9">Come for the tennis, stay for the food.</h2><p>Every year, the U.S. Open offers fare from some of New York City’s most popular joints. That means that in addition to the standard food offered at sporting events, like hot dogs and hamburgers, there’s plenty of other options such as ice cream from Van Leeuwen, pizza from San Matteo and Greek favorites from King Souvlaki.</p><p>Pro tip: During the tournament’s first week, the food court (adjacent to Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadiums) can become tough to navigate with bustling crowds. For those looking to avoid the lines, consider walking over to the Grandstand, where there are several concession stands that are less crowded.</p><p>Another option is to grab a bite on the way to the tournament in a nearby neighborhood. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/dining/food-queens-us-open.html" title="">Downtown Flushing</a>, just one train stop away, offers some of the best Chinese food in the city.</p><p>Another pro tip: For those new to the U.S. Open, try a <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023426-honey-deuce-melon-ball-punch" title="">Honey Deuce, the signature cocktail</a> of the tournament. The mix of vodka, lemonade, raspberry liqueur, lemon juice and honeydew melon is refreshing on days when the heat rises.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A staff member shielded the player Frances Tiafoe from the sun last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-64d164a1">Stay cool (no, really).</h2><p>New York’s weather during the U.S. Open can range from hot and humid to hotter and more humid. When it’s sweltering outside, the first thing to do before heading to the U.S. Open is to wear light clothing. And bring a hat.</p><p>Glass bottles or cans are prohibited, but fans are allowed to bring in metal or plastic reusable water bottles that hold up to 24 ounces. Fans can refill their water bottles at water fountains across the grounds and inside the main stadiums.</p><p>For those who need a break from the sun, there’s plenty of shade in the plaza just south of Arthur Ashe.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Coco Gauff will defend her title during the U.S. Open.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-164f6cbe">Keep an eye on these players.</h2><p>Coco Gauff, the 20-year-old American, and Novak Djokovic, fresh off a gold medal in Paris, will look to defend their singles titles. For Djokovic, victory at this year’s U.S. Open would make his 25th Grand Slam title, extending his record in the realm of men’s singles.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Another player to watch is Carlos Alcaraz. The 21-year-old Spaniard arrives at the U.S. Open after winning two Grand Slam titles his year (the French Open and Wimbledon).</p><p>The New York crowd typically loves to rally behind any Americans playing the tournament. The top-ranked American men expected to play in the U.S. Open are Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton. Behind Gauff, the top-ranked American women are Jessica Pegula and Danielle Collins, who has said she plans to retire at the end of this year.</p><p>Don’t expect to see the 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal. He <a href="https://x.com/RafaelNadal/status/1821285738840768904" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced in early August</a> that he will miss the tournament, saying that he didn’t think he “would be able to give” his 100 percent.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Naomi Osaka will return to the U.S. Open this year.

Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-193447bc">There are comebacks and rivalries.</h2><p>Two former U.S. Open champions will return to the tournament after missing last year’s competition. Naomi Osaka, who won the U.S. Open women’s title in 2018 and 2020, will attempt a comeback after having a baby last year.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Emma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open in a surprising run in 2021, will also return this year. She missed most of last year after having three surgeries.</p><p>One matchup that surely would be a thriller is Djokovic v. Alcaraz. If they advanced through the draw, they would face off in the final. They’ve played each other twice this year: during the French Open final (Alcaraz won) and for a gold medal at the Olympics (Djokovic won).</p><h2 id="link-3ae5707c">Save the date(s).</h2><p>Qualifying matches for the U.S. Open began on Aug. 19 and run through Aug. 22.</p><p>The main draw of the tournament begins on Aug. 26, with quarterfinal matches in the singles tournaments scheduled to begin on Sept. 3.</p><p>The women’s singles final will be played on Sept. 7, and the tournament ends on Sept. 8 with the men’s singles final.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jesus Jiménez covers breaking news, online trends and other subjects.
