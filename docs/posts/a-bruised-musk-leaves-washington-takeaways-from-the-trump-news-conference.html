Take care.” “Thank you.” “Today it’s about a man named Elon. And he’s one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced. With the with the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon has delivered a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington.” “The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger. And I’m confident that over time, we will see $1 trillion of savings.” “Many of the DOGE people, Elon, are staying behind, too, so they’re not leaving. And Elon’s really not leaving. He’s going to be back and forth, I think. I have a feeling — it’s his baby. And I think he’s going to be doing a lot of things.” “And I’ll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president. And I look forward to times being back in this amazing room.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/30/multimedia/30dc-musk-takeaways-vgzj/30dc-musk-takeaways-vgzj-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX stepped down from his role in the Department of Government Efficiency as his term as a special government employee came to an end.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-05-30T18:21:01-04:00">May 30, 2025, <span>6:21 p.m. ET</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“He had to go through the slings and the arrows, which is a shame,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>Tesla, Mr. Musk’s carmaker, has faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/tesla-musk-trump-backlash.html" title="">protests, vandalism and plummeting</a> stock prices as the billionaire deepened his involvement with right-wing politics.</p><p>The relationship between the two men started out rocky. Mr. Musk once suggested <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/07/12/elon-musk-says-donald-trump-should-sit-out-2024-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump shouldn’t run for office</a>, and <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/108636743295734643" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the president brushed him off.</a></p><p>“I could have said, “‘Drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it,” Mr. Trump said on social media in 2022.</p><p>But they formed an alliance that helped Mr. Trump return to the presidency. Mr. Musk lavished the president with campaign donations and compliments and he, in turn, was given free rein to inject himself into any federal agency.</p><h2 id="link-1d2db627">Musk once said it was easy to cut government. Now he says it’s ‘hard.’</h2><p>While Mr. Musk seemed to delight to inflicting pain on government workers — celebrating layoffs and cuts to the federal government by wielding a chain saw — his so-called Department of Government Efficiency never came close to achieving his goal of cutting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">$1 trillion from the federal budget.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Along the way, he changed his tune on how difficult it was to find the massive cuts in the federal government that he had promised.</p><p>In February, Mr. Musk leaped onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference with a chain saw and remarked “how easy” it was to “save billions of dollars sometimes in, in an hour.”</p><p>But on Friday, he cast the work of vetting government spending as extraordinarily time-consuming and difficult, scrutinizing line items in a tedious and painstaking manner.</p><p>“It’s mostly just a lot of hard work,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-7ddce096">DOGE will live on.</h2><p>Despite Mr. Musk’s departure, DOGE isn’t going anywhere, both men said.</p><p>The president said Mr. Musk had “installed geniuses with an engineering mind-set and unbelievably talented people in computers” in various agencies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Elon is really not leaving,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s going to be back and forth. I have a feeling it’s his baby.”</p><p>Mr. Musk promised the $1 trillion in savings would eventually be found. The DOGE website currently claims $175 billion in cuts. But Mr. Musk’s team has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">repeatedly inflated its cost-saving efforts</a>, at times posting erroneous claims that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-trump.html" title="">they later deleted.</a></p><p>“This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,” he said, before comparing DOGE to Buddhism and saying “it’s like a way of life.”</p><h2 id="link-66d34a51">Musk dodged questions about his drug use.</h2><p>Mr. Musk refused to answer a reporter’s question regarding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/elon-musk-drugs-children-trump.html" title="">The New York Times’s report that he had been using drugs far more intensely than previously known.</a></p><p>He did not address the contents of the report, but attacked the paper’s credibility, before saying, “Let’s move on,” as Mr. Trump watched silently.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3fc6f4b5">What about that black eye?</h2><p>Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/elon-musk-black-eye.html?smid=url-share" title="">appeared to be sporting a black eye</a>. When a reporter asked about it, he explained that he had been “horsing around” with his 5-year-old son, X.</p><p>“I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face,’” Mr. Musk recalled. “And he did.”</p><h2 id="link-3904a335">Musk fades into the background.</h2><p>Friday’s news conference was meant to honor Mr. Musk, but he was not the center of attention.</p><p>Members of the media allowed into the Oval Office directed a majority of their questions to the president, and Mr. Musk at times looked distracted, admiring the office’s ceiling and fidgeting as Mr. Trump held court on a variety of topics, including his signature spending bill and his desire to do away with the debt ceiling restraint on federal spending.</p><p>“I think you should get rid of it. It’s too catastrophic,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>Mr. Musk did jump back into the question-and-answer portion of the news conference to express his displeasure with federal judges who have upheld limits on the administration’s power.</p><p>Trump officials have intensified their attacks on judges as the administration’s court loses have mounted, and Mr. Musk seemed to enjoy getting in some final shots against the judiciary.</p><p>He accused judges of “immense judicial overreach that is constitutional.”</p><p>“It needs to stop,” he said. “It’s gone too far.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers the White House for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
