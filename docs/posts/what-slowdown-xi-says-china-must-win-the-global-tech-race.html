Not the economic slowdown or heavy local government debt, nor a trade war with the United States.</p><p>The meeting in Beijing, called the National People’s Congress, was once a stage for Communist Party leaders to make a show of public consultation. Congress delegates, although handpicked by the party, sometimes <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/768697.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chided officials</a> over problems like pollution. There were even rare flashes of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/china-s-wen-rebukes-key-leadership-contender-idUSDEE82D07C/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discord among senior officials</a>.</p><p>Mr. Xi, though, has turned the meeting into a meticulously orchestrated, weeklong salute to himself and his vision. This time, he urged China to forge ahead in advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, biotechnology and new weapons.</p><p>“Xi has seen how decades of investment into science by the U.S. government after World War II was a knockout success for the United States, and wants to replicate that,” said <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/02/dont-be-fooled-advanced-chips-are-important-for-national.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jimmy Goodrich</a>, who studies China’s science policies as a senior adviser at RAND Corporation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“He believes strongly that only by being more self-sufficient and a global leader in science can China achieve success in upgrading its economy, boosting its military capabilities and achieving world-leader status,” Mr. Goodrich said.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s implicit message is that other efforts, such as restoring the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/business/china-xi-jinping-jack-ma.html" title="">confidence of China’s private entrepreneurs</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/world/asia/china-xi-common-prosperity.html" title="">,</a> must align with that bigger national goal.</p><p>The meeting allows Mr. Xi to give his priorities the gloss of public approval. Dissenting votes from the nearly 3,000 delegates have become exceedingly rare. (The only element of intrigue was the absence of Zhao Leji, the chairman of the congress, on Tuesday as the session closed; an official said he had a respiratory infection.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Xi meeting with delegates from Jiangsu Province, who were seen diligently taking notes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yan Yan/Xinhua, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Xi’s agenda told the story.

He <a href="http://www.81.cn/jwtt/16373510.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demanded that China’s military</a> become more efficient in implementing modernization plans, rooting out graft, and also more nimble in applying advanced technologies to “accelerate the development of qualitatively new combat capabilities.” China’s military has been working on next-generation jet fighters, unmanned drones, new submarines and other weapons.</p><p>Mr. Xi’s priorities were also reflected in <a href="https://npcobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-MOF-Report_NON-FINAL_ZH.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China’s annual budget</a>, which projects that government spending on science and technology will rise by 8.3 percent this year, on education by 6.1 percent and on the military by 7.2 percent. The government set more modest increases of around 5 percent in spending on health care and social welfare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Xi met with delegates from the People’s Liberation Army and urged the military to develop new combat capabilities.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Li Gang/Xinhua, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The Chinese government’s science and technology budget this year is equal to about $172 billion, second to the United States. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/climate/trump-nsf-cuts-antarctica.html" title="">government cuts</a> under Mr. Trump could narrow the U.S. lead. Including investment from businesses, the United States spent $806 billion on research and development in 2021, compared to $668 billion in China, according to an estimate <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20243/discovery-u-s-and-global-r-d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last year</a> from the U.S. National Science Foundation.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Over the past six or seven years of U.S.-China strategic competition, the two most important issues have been geopolitics and technology,” said <a href="https://eastasia.nccu.edu.tw/PageStaffing/Detail?fid=3022&amp;id=597" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wang Hsin-hsien</a>, a professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei who studies Chinese politics. “In China they probably see that there may be a little less pressure on them geopolitically, but there won’t be any easing up from Trump on the technology front.”</p><p>Some critics have argued that Mr. Xi’s bet on futuristic goals comes at the cost of providing help to Chinese citizens struggling to make ends meet. The economy is still sagging under a steep fall in housing prices. The number of retirees is growing and the birthrate has slumped. Yet Mr. Xi appears insistent that China can overcome its problems by tilting spending to technological projects and upgrading industry.</p><p>So far, Mr. Xi has not indicated a willingness to rein in China’s export drive after Mr. Trump imposed additional tariffs on goods from China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Xi has turned the annual legislative meeting into a meticulously orchestrated, weeklong salute to himself and his vision. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pedro Pardo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Nor does Mr. Xi seem worried about any threats to his political dominance. After more than 12 years in power, he has given <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/22/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-congress.html" title="">no sign of choosing a successor</a>. The retired leaders who may once have hemmed in his power have mostly passed away. He has never slackened his tight grip on the key levers of power, such as the Ministry of State Security, said <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/jonathan-a-czin/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan Czin</a>, a researcher at the Brookings Institution who formerly worked in the Central Intelligence Agency and studies <a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/burying-deng-xi-jinping-and-the-abnormalization-of-chinese-politics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chinese politics</a>.</p><p>“So far, I see zero evidence of meaningful cracks in Xi’s control. Who at this point in Xi’s tenure would have the temerity to challenge Xi?” Mr. Czin said. “He wields the anti-corruption apparatus like a cudgel, ready to bludgeon any potential opponent.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-buckley">More about Chris Buckley</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/communist-party-of-china">Communist Party of China</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/ministry-of-state-security-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china">Ministry of State Security of the People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/national-peoples-congress-china">National People&#39;s Congress (China)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
