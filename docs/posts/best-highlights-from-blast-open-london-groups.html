			<p>BBL will probably go through with changes due to the recent Profek incident. As unfair as it is on the player, the comments about Ataturk would probably leave a bad taste in the fan base if he plays for them. As crazy as this sounds, I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing BBL get Ruxic and Hiro to pair with Sociablee and Lewn. Ruxic and Sociablee have that unflinching confidence in aim battles whilst Hiro and Lewn are young guns who can take over at a moment&#39;s notice. Jamppi as IGL would be completely fine for me since he is a very interpersonal guy especially with the Turkish players.</p>
<p>For Talon, I can&#39;t imagine much changing asides having some of the academy players promoted. Snappy and Canady are probably around Thyy&#39;s level of mechanical aim. Though, I see Talon as needing a new IGL and there aren&#39;t many Thai IGLs at the moment. CGRS would be perfect since he plays scan-initiator and is Thai, but he will probably stick to content creation.</p>
<p>C9 probably have OXY strapped to a great deal in his contract. He could have probably gone to G2 if he wanted to win trophies. C9 need to scout for Tier 2 talent right now since players like Xeppaa and Net aren&#39;t quite cutting it. They can definitely take over, but they can easily be lost in a map. C9 should focus their rebuild around OXY and V1c since they are both very promising in their roles and get along.</p>		</div></div>
