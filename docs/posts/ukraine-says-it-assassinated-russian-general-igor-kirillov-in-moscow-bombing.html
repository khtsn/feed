He helped develop a thermobaric rocket launcher, the TOS-2, according to a biography published by RIA Novosti. The Russian military frequently reports its use in Ukraine.</p><p>His apparent assassination represents the highest-profile such death of a Russian military official far from the battlefield since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While other Russian generals have died in occupied Ukraine or near the front line, he is the highest-ranking military official to have been killed inside Russia.</p><p>General Kirillov, who once headed a Russian military academy, was also prominent in Russia’s propaganda campaign against Ukraine and the West, frequently addressing the news media and appearing on television with unfounded claims. In 2023, for instance, he <a href="https://ria.ru/20230619/biooruzhie-1879093322.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that</a> the United States was planning to use drones “designed to spread infected mosquitoes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>General Kirillov <a href="https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/21306349" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also claimed</a> that Russian forces had uncovered a Ukrainian chemical weapons production laboratory near Avdiivka, a Ukrainian city that Moscow’s troops captured in February. Part of the buildup to the war was an effort by Russia to portray Ukraine, without evidence, as a hub for producing weapons of mass destruction at the behest of the West. Ukraine vigorously denied the claim.</p><p>The explosion that killed General Kirillov occurred about 6:12 a.m. and was so powerful that it damaged windows as far up as the third floor and shattered them in a building across the street, the RIA Novosti state news agency reported. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Another state news agency, Tass, said investigators had found a hidden camera used to monitor General Kirillov in a car-sharing vehicle nearby. </p><p>In a video that the S.B.U. official shared with The New York Times and other news outlets, recorded<strong> </strong>from the interior of a car, two people can be seen leaving a building just moments before a blast. The New York Times verified that the video was recorded from a vehicle used for short-term rentals and it matched the details in the footage with the location and time when General Kirillov was killed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the clip, a scooter stands next to the building’s door, where the explosion appeared to have taken place, matching a description given by Russian investigators about where the explosive was planted.</p><p>The bomb had the force of more than two pounds of TNT, Tass said, citing investigators.</p><p>There was no comment from the Kremlin in the hours after the killing on Tuesday, though Russian state television carried it as a top story in daytime news broadcasts, calling it a “tragedy.”</p><p>At Russia’s lower house of Parliament, the body’s chairman, Vyacheslav Volodin, held a moment of silence for the general and described him as “not only a military leader, but first and foremost a scientist.”</p><p>A senior American official said on Tuesday that the United States was not informed about the planned assassination. The official said it could be counterproductive because it might trigger a severe reaction from Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. U.S. officials have generally disapproved<span>  </span>of sabotage and targeted killings inside Russia for that reason.</p><p>The S.B.U. is Ukraine’s main domestic security agency, with responsibilities that include counterintelligence and tackling organized crime and terrorism. During the war, its duties have extended to conducting sabotage operations and killings inside Russia, in a campaign targeting prominent pro-Kremlin figures and military officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Unable to halt a grinding Russian advance on the battlefield, Ukraine has increasingly carried out deadly covert actions. Just last month, the S.B.U. took credit for a car bombing that killed a senior commander of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Russian-occupied Crimea. The same agency carried out attacks on the bridge connecting Crimea to Russia in 2022, disrupting flows of military supplies.</p><p>U.S. officials believe Ukraine’s security services were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/ukraine-russia-dugina-assassination.html" title="">behind the 2022 killing of Daria Dugina</a>, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist. And the S.B.U. claimed responsibility for the assassination last month of Valery Trankovsky, a senior Russian naval officer, who Ukraine said had ordered missile strikes at civilian targets. Both were killed in car bombings.</p><p>Ukraine uses these kind of covert operations to help compensate for its disadvantages against its larger, better equipped adversary, analysts say. </p><p>John Foreman, a former British defense attaché in Moscow and Kyiv, said the assassination had two main goals: retaliating for the use of chemical weapons on the Ukrainian battlefield and sending “a clear message to all those politicians and military officers responsible for planning, directing and supporting Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine” that they too are at risk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>But for all the concern the killing may raise in the Russian Amy, it is unlikely to change the situation on the battlefield, Mr. Foreman added. The Kremlin remains determined to fully occupy the four Ukrainian regions it has declared its own and “is not backing down,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The general and his aide died after an explosive device planted in a scooter was detonated, according to a statement from Russia’s Investigative Committee, a law enforcement agency.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuri Kochetkov/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The S.B.U. said that Russian forces, on General Kirillov’s orders, had used chemical weapons on the battlefield more than 4,800 times since the war began. Russia <a href="https://www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2024/07/ec106nat06%28e%29.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied the accusations</a> during a July meeting of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</p><p>Ukraine has said the chemical weapons used by Russia often include combat grenades equipped with the irritant chemical agents CS and CN. Those tear gases, most commonly used by riot police officers to control crowds, are banned in warfare under the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries, including Russia.</p><p>The Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian open-source research group operating from exile, has said that Russian forces have used tear gas on the battlefield in violation of international conventions. The group has said that photo and video evidence has suggested that Russian troops used grenades with tear gas against Ukrainian soldiers.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/world/europe/us-russia-chemical-weapons-ukraine.html" title="">The U.S. State Department said this spring</a> that Russia had used chloropicrin, a choking agent widely used in World War I, as well as tear gas on the battlefield.
