The Trump administration and G.O.P. lawmakers have proposed sizable reductions in Medicaid spending in part to find savings to pay for President Trump’s tax-cut package.</p><p>Dr. Oz, 64, has for years been a vocal proponent of Medicare Advantage, the private insurance plans for older Americans, despite federal inquiries and lawmakers’ concerns that insurers have overbilled the government <a href="https://www.medpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Mar25_MedPAC_Report_To_Congress_SEC.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by tens of billions of dollars a year.</a> He promoted it on his TV show and acted as a broker for one company that sells the plan.</p><p>At his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/health/dr-oz-senate-confirmation-medicaid-medicare-cms.html" title="">confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee</a> last month, he seemed to acknowledge problems with Medicare Advantage, and tried to reassure senators that there was a “new sheriff in town.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Democrats on the committee grilled him at length about the potential steep cuts to Medicaid, which could result in a substantial number of people becoming ineligible for health coverage.</p><p>In recent days, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has overseen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/health-department-job-layoffs-rfk-jr.html" title="">deep cuts to the Health and Human Services Department</a>, including laying off roughly 10,000 employees on top of another 10,000 buyouts, retirements and departures early on in the new Trump administration.</p><p>The cutbacks also affect Dr. Oz’s agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which has a budget of about $1.5 trillion in annual spending. Still, Dr. Oz has given few clues as to what if any changes he has planned.</p><p>Dr. Oz’s ability to secure enough votes for confirmation was up in the air until recently. Then, earlier this week Senator Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/health/dr-oz-medicare-finances-conflicts.html" title="">said he had decided to support his nomination</a> because Dr. Oz told him that he would no longer support transgender care for minors and was “unequivocally pro-life.” Mr. Hawley had publicly said he was withholding his support over Dr. Oz’s previous positions on these issues.</p><p>Senators largely sidestepped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/health/dr-oz-medicare-finances-conflicts.html" title="">criticism of Dr. Oz’s extensive and often murky financial tie</a>s to companies he will oversee in his new position.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He and his wife are wealthy.
