The police said they had taken “a lone suspect” into custody at the scene: the driver, a 30-year-old Vancouver man.</p><p>Investigators had ruled out terrorism as a motive, Vancouver police said in an email, but they did not offer further details. Photographs published by news agencies showed what appeared to be a black SUV with significant damage to the front of the vehicle, and its airbags deployed.</p><p>“At approximately 8:14 p.m. on April 26, a man drove into a large crowd of people attending the Lapu Lapu Day Festival near East 43rd Avenue and Fraser Street,” the Vancouver police said in a <a href="https://x.com/VancouverPD/status/1916389760853283167" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on social media. The annual event celebrates Datu Lapu Lapu, a national hero in the Philippines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“As of now, we can confirm nine people have died after a man drove through a crowd at last night’s Lapu Lapu Festival,” the police said in another <a href="https://x.com/VancouverPD/status/1916433395888128348" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on social media early Sunday. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic incident.”</p><p>In a news conference, Steve Rai, the interim police chief, did not address a possible motive for the incident, but said the driver had been known to the police. Members of the crowd had subdued the man before officers got to the scene, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers on Sunday investigating the scene in Vancouver.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Helgren/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The incident occurred less than 48 hours before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/canada/canada-election-mark-carney-china.html" title="">federal elections</a> were set to take place in Canada. When asked by reporters whether the incident was related to the elections, Mr. Rai said, “I don’t know anything about that.”</p><p>Underscoring the police’s initial assessment that the attack was an isolated event, the police are will allow a 10-kilometer run that drew more than 45,000 entrants last year to go ahead on Sunday. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The incident occurred just as Apl.de.ap, a Filipino American rapper and a founding member of the Black Eyed Peas, had finished a concert performance at the festival on the grounds of a high school.</p><p>Alan Kane, a witness, told CBC Radio that just before the attack, the crowd on the street where it occurred was “wall to wall” and lined up for food trucks. He said that it appeared that the street was blocked to traffic only by plastic barriers.</p><p>Several witnesses told Canadian news outlets that those barriers had been pulled back before the incident. Kris Pangilinan, who was selling clothing at a booth, said that some cars and trucks had been allowed into the crowded street to allow vendors to pack up their stands. The Audi SUV, he said, had initially moved cautiously into the crowd before rapidly accelerating, knocking down victims.</p><p>“It looked like we literally in a war zone,” Mr. Pangilinan told the CBC.</p><p>Other witnesses said the driver tried to run away before being subdued by bystanders.</p><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada said in a social media post that he was “devastated to hear about the horrific events at the Lapu Lapu festival in Vancouver earlier this evening.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I offer my deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured, to the Filipino Canadian community, and to everyone in Vancouver,” he said. “We are all mourning with you.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Carney said that his schedule for the final day of campaigning before Monday’s vote would be revised because of the attack.</p><p>Vancouver’s mayor, Ken Sim, <a href="https://x.com/KenSimCity/status/1916350887288836313" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he was “shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific incident.”</p><p>Vancouver prides itself on being a diverse, multicultural city, with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/2021-census-minority-demographics-metro-vancouver-bc-1.6630164" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than half of its residents</a> identifying themselves as a “visible minority,” according to 2021 census data.</p><p>Lapu Lapu Day is an annual celebration in the Philippines, marking the memory of Datu Lapu Lapu, who stood up against Spanish colonization. In Vancouver, <a href="https://lapulapuday.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the festival</a> was established as an annual event in 2023.</p><p>President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. of the Philippines said in a statement on Sunday that he was “completely shattered to hear about the terrible incident” in Vancouver, and he expressed his “deepest sympathies” to the families of the victims.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ali Watkins covers international news and is based in London.</p></div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.</p></div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
