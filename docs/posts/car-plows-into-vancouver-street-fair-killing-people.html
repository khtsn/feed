The police said they had taken “a lone suspect” into custody at the scene: the driver, a 30-year-old Vancouver man.</p><p>“At approximately 8:14 p.m. on April 26, a man drove into a large crowd of people attending the Lapu Lapu Day Festival near East 43rd Avenue and Fraser Street,” the Vancouver police said in a <a href="https://x.com/VancouverPD/status/1916389760853283167" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on social media. The annual event celebrates Datu Lapu-Lapu, a national hero in the Philippines.</p><p>“As of now, we can confirm nine people have died after a man drove through a crowd at last night’s Lapu Lapu Festival,” the police said in another <a href="https://x.com/VancouverPD/status/1916433395888128348" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on social media early Sunday. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic incident.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Vancouver police said in an email that investigators had ruled out terrorism as a motive, but they did not offer further details.

Members of the crowd had subdued the man before officers got to the scene, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers investigating the scene in Vancouver on Sunday.
