Mr. Macron is expected to address the nation in a televised speech at 8 p.m. local time, but it is unclear when he will announce Mr. Barnier’s replacement.</p><p>The announcement of Mr. Barnier’s caretaker role came one day<strong> </strong>after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/europe/france-no-confidence-barnier.html" title="">no-confidence vote</a> forced him to resign and left the country in political turmoil without a budget for the new year.</p><p>It was the first successful no-confidence vote in France in over 60 years, and it made Mr. Barnier’s three-month-old government the shortest-tenured in modern French history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Finding a prime minister who can withstand the political challenges will not be easy. France is deeply polarized, and the lower house of Parliament could try to bring down any new government.</p><p>The no-confidence vote came at a difficult time for France. The country is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html" title="">struggling with high debt and a widening deficit</a>. Its strong backing for Ukraine faces a challenge with the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States, and its partner in leading Europe, Germany, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/europe/germany-coalition-collapse-government.html" title="">weaker politically and economically</a> than it has been in years.</p><p>And Mr. Macron himself is unpopular.</p><h2 id="link-637e7577">What happens next?</h2><p>Mr. Macron can choose to take his time in naming a new prime minister, and he can appoint whomever he likes — it does not need to be someone from the biggest party in Parliament. But the country’s economic predicament could push him to act fast.</p><p>As caretaker prime minister, Mr. Barnier’s role is somewhat limited.</p><p>No legal texts detail what those limits are, but French jurists agree that a caretaker government can’t propose laws or draw up a budget. But it can issue decrees to apply existing laws, and it can take care of matters such as paying workers and distributing pensions.</p><p>It can also act more forcefully if there is an emergency — suggesting that Mr. Barnier could take measures to avoid a budget crisis in 2025 if no new government were appointed by the end of this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The bottom line is that there is a lot of uncertainty, particularly about how to deal with France’s financial woes.</p><p>The country’s large debt and deficit “will not disappear by enchantment,” Mr. Barnier warned lawmakers on Wednesday.</p><h2 id="link-6758090c">How does the French government work?</h2><p>Lawmakers in the lower house are directly chosen by the electorate, as is the president.</p><p>The prime minister and cabinet are accountable to the lower house, and they determine the country’s domestic policies, including the budget. But they are appointed by the president, who has extensive executive powers of his own.</p><p>Most of the time, the president and prime minister are politically aligned. France usually holds presidential and legislative elections every five years within weeks of each other, making it likely that voters will support the same party twice. In that scenario — as happened for Mr. Macron’s first term — the president would have a strong majority and a supportive prime minister.</p><p>But Mr. Macron’s decision to call snap elections last summer upended that cycle. His coalition lost badly and the lower house has no single dominant party, leaving him with a difficult task to appoint a prime minister acceptable both to him and to a majority of lawmakers in the chamber.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>When a single opposition party controls the lower house, the equation is simpler: The president appoints the leader of that opposition as prime minister, and the two undergo what is known as a “cohabitation.” That has happened before, and, though it is uncomfortable for the president, it is relatively stable.</p><p>But a divided situation like the current one is much rarer — and much more fragile.</p><h2 id="link-41b98f61">What is the background to the crisis?</h2><p>The no-confidence motion was filed this week after Mr. Barnier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/europe/france-budget-no-confidence-vote.html" title="">pushed a social security spending bill</a> through the lower house of Parliament without a final vote.</p><p>The motion was filed by an alliance of left-wing parties called the New Popular Front and was supported by Marine Le Pen’s nationalist, anti-immigrant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/world/europe/france-national-rally-rebranding.html" title="">National Rally party</a> and its allies.</p><p>With 331 votes in favor, the motion easily cleared the 288-vote threshold — more than half of the total number of lawmakers elected to the lower house — to succeed.</p><h2 id="link-12363794">How did France get here?</h2><p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/world/europe/france-election-results-left-surges.html" title="">the snap elections</a>, instead of naming a politician from the leftist coalition that won the most seats, Mr. Macron called on Mr. Barnier, a figure from the traditional centrist right. The leftist coalition was furious.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“We knew from Day 1 that he was going to fall,” Mathilde Panot, a lawmaker for the leftist France Unbowed party, told reporters on Wednesday. Mr. Barnier’s appointment, she added, “was a provocation against the French people’s vote.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/03/multimedia/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/03/multimedia/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/03/multimedia/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A group of politicians applaud while sitting on red benches in a chamber." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/03/multimedia/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/03/multimedia/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/03/multimedia/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/03/multimedia/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl/03france-explainer02sub-photo-zvfl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b7f2943b-c22d-5ec5-804a-d7144f5e13d9" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lawmakers applauding as the results of the no-confidence vote were read in the National Assembly in Paris on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Since then, Mr. Barnier has been living “the hell of Matignon,” a phrase used by political commentators to describe the difficulties of reigning from the Matignon palace, seat of the government, where a prime minister has some power, but hardly all of it. That was especially true for Mr. Barnier, who had to work with a bitterly divided lower house of Parliament.</p><p>Mr. Barnier was supported by a tenuous coalition of conservatives from his own party and centrists who support Mr. Macron. But he was unable to fend off challenges from the left and far right against his budget, a $60 billion mix of spending cuts and tax increases.</p><h2 id="link-251a769c">What about the budget?</h2><p>Legal experts are <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2024/12/04/quel-avenir-pour-le-budget-apres-la-censure-du-gouvernement-barnier_6430272_4355770.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">divided</a> over whether the no-confidence vote has buried the budget bills for good or if Mr. Barnier’s successor could amend them in a way that is more acceptable to Parliament.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>If Mr. Macron appoints a prime minister before the end of the year, an entirely new budget could be submitted, and Parliament would have 70 days to examine it.</p><p>But that would still mean France would not have a spending law by the new year. Under French law, the government could propose a “special measure” reapplying the 2024 budget. Civil servants would be paid and taxes would remain at their current level.</p><p>If Parliament refuses to go along or does not hold a vote, Mr. Macron could also invoke his extraordinary constitutional powers and simply impose a budget. But jurists agree that the consequences of such an untested move could be severe, especially as the French president is often challenged for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/europe/macron-france-government.html" title="">failing to respect the voice of voters</a>.</p><h2 id="link-7f25d70d">What happens to Macron?</h2><p>Under the French Constitution, Mr. Macron can remain as president until his term expires in 2027, though some politicians on both the left and the right are calling for his resignation. Analysts say that Ms. Le Pen is especially eager to trigger an early presidential election.</p><p>“I’m not demanding Emmanuel Macron’s resignation,” Ms. Le Pen told TF1 television on Wednesday. But, she said, “Pressure on the president of the Republic will get increasingly strong.”</p><p>So far, though, Mr. Macron has resisted calls to step down, saying they are far-fetched. His term is limited, and he cannot seek another consecutive stint in office.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Nossiter has been bureau chief in Kabul, Paris, West Africa and New Orleans, and is now a Domestic Correspondent on the Obituaries desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-nossiter">More about Adam Nossiter</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>In France, Government And Budget Are in Peril<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
