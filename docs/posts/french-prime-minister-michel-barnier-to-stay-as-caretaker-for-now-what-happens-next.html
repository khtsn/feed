Mr. Macron is expected to address the nation in a televised speech at 8 p.m. local time.</p><p>The announcement came one day<strong> </strong>after Mr. Barnier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/europe/france-no-confidence-barnier.html" title="">lost a no-confidence vote</a> that left the country in political turmoil and without a clear path to a budget as it enters the new year.</p><p>It was the first successful no-confidence vote in France in over 60 years, and it made Mr. Barnier’s three-month-old government the shortest-tenured in modern French history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Finding a prime minister who can withstand the political challenges will not be easy. France is deeply polarized, and the lower house of Parliament could try to bring down any new government.</p><p>The vote came at a difficult time for France. The country is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html" title="">struggling with high debt and a widening deficit</a>. Its strong backing for Ukraine faces a challenge with the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States, and its partner in leading Europe, Germany, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/europe/germany-coalition-collapse-government.html" title="">weaker politically and economically</a> than it has been in years.</p><p>And Mr. Macron himself is unpopular.</p><h2 id="link-6a495886">What is the background?</h2><p>The no-confidence motion was filed this week after Mr. Barnier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/europe/france-budget-no-confidence-vote.html" title="">pushed a social security spending bill</a> through the lower house of Parliament without a final vote.</p><p>The motion was filed by an alliance of left-wing parties called the New Popular Front and was supported by Marine Le Pen’s nationalist, anti-immigrant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/world/europe/france-national-rally-rebranding.html" title="">National Rally party</a> and its allies.</p><p>With 331 votes in favor, the motion easily cleared the 288-vote threshold — more than half of the total number of lawmakers elected to the lower house — to succeed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While Mr. Barnier and the cabinet are required to resign; Mr. Macron is not. But in a byproduct of the no-confidence vote, the spending bill was also rejected, and Mr. Barnier’s other budget bills, like the general state budget for 2025, are in limbo.</p><h2 id="link-768d8404">What does it mean?</h2><p>Is France hurtling toward a constitutional crisis, or an American-style government shutdown in which civil servants are unpaid and departments are unfunded?</p><p>Not exactly.</p><p>France’s Constitution offers several scenarios that could keep the country’s affairs more or less in order, at least in the short term, and laws exist to provide continuity in the absence of a government and budget.</p><p>But the political turmoil that has gripped France since Mr. Macron called snap elections last summer is worsening, and the country’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html" title="">struggling economy could pay a hefty price</a>.</p><p>France’s large debt and deficit “will not disappear by enchantment,” Mr. Barnier told lawmakers on Wednesday, as he warned of rising interest rates, flailing purchasing power and declining investment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The collapse of his government, he added, “will make everything more serious and more difficult.”</p><h2 id="link-12363794">How did France get here?</h2><p>The results of the elections that Mr. Macron called last summer were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/world/europe/france-election-results-left-surges.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">disastrous for his party</a> and its allies. But instead of naming a politician from the leftist coalition that won the most seats in the election, Mr. Macron called on Mr. Barnier, a figure from the traditional centrist right. The leftist coalition was furious.</p><p>“We knew from Day 1 that he was going to fall,” Mathilde Panot, a top lawmaker for the leftist France Unbowed party, told reporters on Wednesday. Mr. Barnier’s appointment, she added, “was a provocation against the French people’s vote.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lawmakers applauding as the results of the no-confidence vote were read in the National Assembly in Paris on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since then, Mr. Barnier has been living “the hell of Matignon,” a phrase used by political commentators to describe the difficulties of reigning from the Matignon palace, seat of the government, where a prime minister has some power, but hardly all of it. That was especially true for Mr. Barnier, who had to work with a bitterly divided lower house of Parliament where no party or bloc has a majority and few are inclined to work together.</p><p>Mr. Barnier was supported by a tenuous coalition of conservatives from his own party and centrists that support Mr. Macron. But he was unable to fend off challenges from the left and far right against his budget, an unpopular $60 billion mix of spending cuts and tax increases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-637e7577">What happens next?</h2><p>Mr. Macron can take his time in naming a new prime minister, and he can appoint whomever he likes — and not necessarily someone from the biggest party in Parliament. The country’s economic predicament could push him to act fast.</p><p>As caretaker prime minister, Mr. Barnier’s role is somewhat limited.</p><p>No legal texts detail exactly what those limits are, but French jurists agree that a caretaker government can’t propose laws or issue decrees. It can take care of government business like paying workers and distributing pensions, for instance. The cabinet no longer meets.</p><h2 id="link-251a769c">What about the budget?</h2><p>The budget itself has entered a kind of limbo. Legal experts are <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2024/12/04/quel-avenir-pour-le-budget-apres-la-censure-du-gouvernement-barnier_6430272_4355770.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">divided</a> over whether the no-confidence vote has buried the existing budget bills for good, or if Mr. Barnier’s successor could pick up them up and amend them in a way that is more acceptable to Parliament.</p><p>If Mr. Macron acts quickly and appoints a prime minister before the end of the year, an entirely new government budget could be submitted, and the Parliament would have 70 days to examine it.</p><p>But that would still mean that France would not have a spending law by the new year. Under French law, the government could simply propose a “special measure” reapplying the 2024 budget. Civil servants would be paid and taxes would remain at their current level.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>If Parliament refuses to go along or does not hold a vote, Mr. Macron could invoke his extraordinary constitutional powers and simply impose a budget. But jurists agree that the political consequences of such an untested move could be severe, especially at a time when the French president is increasingly challenged for failing to respect the voice of French voters.</p><h2 id="link-7f25d70d">What happens to Macron?</h2><p>Under the French Constitution, Mr. Macron can remain as president until his term expires in 2027, but it seems almost certain that his stature will be diminished. Some politicians on both the left and the right are calling for his resignation. Analysts say that Ms. Le Pen is especially eager to trigger an early presidential election.</p><p>“I’m not demanding Emmanuel Macron’s resignation,” Ms. Le Pen told TF1 television on Wednesday. But, she said, “Pressure on the president of the Republic will get increasingly strong.”</p><p>“The final decision is his,” she added.</p><p>So far, though, Mr. Macron has resisted calls to step down, saying they are far-fetched. His term is limited, and he cannot seek another consecutive stint in office.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Nossiter has been bureau chief in Kabul, Paris, West Africa and New Orleans, and is now a Domestic Correspondent on the Obituaries desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-nossiter">More about Adam Nossiter</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>In France, Government And Budget Are in Peril<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
