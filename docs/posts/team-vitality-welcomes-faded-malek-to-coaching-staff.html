This year, the most bloodthirsty platoon commander, William L. Calley Jr., who was convicted of killing at least 22 people, died, spurring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/william-calley-dead.html" title="">obituaries</a> and bouts of <a href="https://www.oxfreepress.com/reflections-lieutenant-william-l-calley-jr-and-vietnam/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reflection</a> in the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Yet survivors in the village mostly did not even know he was dead; instead, they spoke of those who did not kill, or who tried to stop the slaughter.</p><p>My experience of such generosity began with a museum video offering only a brief mention of Lieutenant Calley.
