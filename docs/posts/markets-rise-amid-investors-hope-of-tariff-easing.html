Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said that the commerce ministry had canvassed businesses in China to identify U.S. imports that were crucial to supply chains and vulnerable to China’s new trade barriers. For some companies, he said, “their business model would not work in China, and we would see them exit” if the trade war persisted long-term.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500, which was roughly flat as trading got underway Friday morning, was nearly 4 percent higher for the week, though it remains sharply lower since President Trump returned to office.</p><p>The stock market has seen dramatic swings in recent days, with Wall Street grasping for scraps of information about tariffs, trade and other crucial issues that can shift from day to day. Monday saw a sharp sell-off, followed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/trump-tariff-stocks.html" title="">three days of sizable gains</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Also on Friday, the Chinese government reiterated that it was not engaged in trade negotiations with officials in Washington, pushing back against Mr. Trump’s claim that the U.S.-China talks were underway. “The United States should not confuse the public,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.</p><p>Markets in Asia were broadly higher, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 gaining 1.8 percent and Taiwan’s benchmark index up 2 percent. In Europe, stocks were gaining ground.</p><p>Reports circulating in Chinese media outlets and on Chinese social media this week said that Beijing had decided not to subject some semiconductor-related products that were made in the United States to retaliatory tariffs. The Chinese government has not announced any such policy.</p><p>In the United States, executives at consumer-oriented companies have said that worries over the global economy is dampening spending. On Thursday, PepsiCo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/pepsico-earnings-economy-tariffs.html?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20250425&amp;instance_id=153289&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;regi_id=251415863&amp;segment_id=196713&amp;user_id=960e8d5cd9908877ae9576715dc5434a" title="">cut</a> its full-year guidance outlook, citing a reduction in consumer spending as well as the impact of increased global tariffs. Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes household staples like Tide detergent, also cut its full-year outlook and said whiplash on tariff policy had factored into a “pause” in consumption.</p><p>Elsewhere in the markets:</p><ul><li><p>Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, rose about 3 percent in early trading on Friday. On Thursday, the technology giant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/technology/google-alphabet-earnings.html#:~:text=Alphabet%2C%20Google&#39;s%20parent%20company%2C%20posted,from%20equity%20investments%2C%20not%20operations." title="">reported</a> a large jump in quarterly profit. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index inched higher.</p></li><li><p>The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell three basis points, to 4.27 percent.</p></li><li><p>Oil futures wobbled, with Brent crude falling about 1 percent, to under $66 a barrel.</p></li><li><p>Gold continued its slide, to below $3,300, after briefly reaching a record $3,500 an ounce on Monday.</p></li></ul><p>Claire Fu<!-- --> and <!-- -->Siyi Zhao<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a Times business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on U.S.-China Relations</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Pursuing Activists Abroad: </strong>The U.S. fired a new round of sanctions at China, targeting Chinese and Hong Kong officials over what it described as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/china-hong-kong-sanctions.html">acts of transnational repression</a> for their crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and on U.S. soil.</p></li><li><p><strong>Export Restrictions</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration added 80 primarily Chinese companies and organizations to a list of companies that are barred from buying American technology and other exports because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/business/economy/trump-chinese-tech-firms-chips-security.html">national security concerns</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Consulting Firm Employees Freed: </strong>China has released five employees of an American corporate investigations firm, the Mintz Group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/china-mintz-release-us.html">two years after they were detained</a> as part of a crackdown by Beijing on foreign business consultancies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Panama Canal Deal: </strong>Beijing’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/business/trump-panama-canal-china-hong-kong.html">threat to stop a tycoon’s sale</a> of his ports business has dealmakers wondering if they can still operate without political interference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Voice in Beijing:</strong> Senator Steve Daines of Montana, one of President Trump’s top allies in Congress, has cast himself as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/asia/trump-china-xi-daines.html">an intermediary between the Trump administration and Beijing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>China Says It Offers Stability: </strong>China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, cast his country as a bulwark for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/asia/china-tariffs-us-trump.html">peace and stability in a world thrown into chaos by the Trump administration</a>, even as Beijing provokes its neighbors and fuels trade tensions.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
