</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Still, the effort amounted to an aggressive attempt by the Trump administration to offload a vast amount of federal property, and it immediately raised questions about how the move could affect government services across the country and federal workers who have been ordered to return to the office. It also advanced a major priority for Elon Musk’s government overhaul operation, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, which has fixated on eliminating “underutilized” federal office space.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The original list had included the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice building and the J. Edgar Hoover Building, the F.B.I. headquarters.</p><p>The administration had also identified the headquarters for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Energy Department, the Labor Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and even the General Services Administration. Large office buildings used by the Agriculture Department and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were included.</p><p>The revised list no longer includes those buildings. A spokeswoman for the agency did not provide an immediate comment on the changes.</p><p>The revised list of buildings to potentially sell includes a number of federal office buildings with more than one million square feet each.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The properties are not currently on the market, but the ledger reflects the administration’s intent to sell off government-owned real estate. The General Services Administration will consider and evaluate all serious offers, according to an agency spokeswoman.</p><p>The effect could be felt in regions across the country. Buildings used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were identified as disposable. Social Security Administration offices across the country were also marked for potential sale — including a 534,000-square-foot regional office in Philadelphia and field offices in New Hampshire, western Pennsylvania, and Saginaw, Mich.</p><p>In New York City, the properties included not only the offices used by the U.S. delegation to the U.N., which overlooks the U.N., but also two downtown buildings that house offices for federal prosecutors with the Southern District of New York and the I.R.S.</p><p>Federal office towers in Chicago and Boston were included on the sales ledger; U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, both Democrats, have offices in those buildings. The Chicago building includes more than a million square feet and outposts of the I.R.S. and Drug Enforcement Administration. The Boston tower is more than 800,000 square feet and houses offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Labor Department and others.</p><p>“This plan raises serious concerns,” Ms. Warren said in a statement. “As Donald Trump and Elon Musk dismantle our government, piece by piece, and sell it for parts, it’s the seniors relying on Social Security, the veterans looking for health care, and entrepreneurs applying for small business loans that are paying the price.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Federal buildings that were about a million square feet were also slated for possible sale in Los Angeles, Atlanta, St. Louis, Cleveland, Memphis and Kansas City, Mo. Some included federal and immigration courtrooms.</p><p>It remains unclear how much federal property could be sold and how quickly the buildings could be offloaded. Denise Maes, a regional administrator for the General Services Administration under the Biden administration, said the list represented an “enormous portfolio,” and she worried that selling the buildings could be extremely disruptive for agencies and their workers.</p><p>“I don’t know how much thought is going into this,” Ms. Maes said. “It’s just a wrecking ball in getting rid of things.”</p><p>Ms. Maes said it did not seem rational for the administration to try to sell off many office buildings while also calling federal workers back to the office. She said she was also concerned about the impact on the commercial real estate market if the government pushes up supply and tries to sells buildings at less than market price.</p><p>The list also included a handful of child care centers, including in a federal courthouse on Long Island, N.Y., and a 17,849-square-foot facility for employees of a sprawling federal office complex in Battle Creek, Mich. The entire complex, whose tenants include the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Logistics Agency, is also marked for possible sale.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Tuesday, officials at the General Services Administration said they had also identified properties that were necessary to retain, including courthouses, land ports of entry and other buildings that were critical for national defense and law enforcement. But the agency, which owns and leases <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/real-estate/gsa-properties#:~:text=The%20General%20Services%20Administration%20(GSA,Courthouses" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over 360 million square feet of space</a> in more than 8,000 buildings, said that selling the “non-core” properties could result in savings of more than $430 million in annual operating costs.</p><p>“Decades of funding deficiencies have resulted in many of these buildings becoming functionally obsolete and unsuitable for use by our federal work force,” the agency said in <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/statement-regarding-gsas-disposal-of-noncore-assets-03042025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a>. “We can no longer hope that funding will emerge to resolve these longstanding issues.”</p><p>Edward Wong<!-- --> and <!-- -->Brad Plumer<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Madeleine Ngo covers U.S. economic policy and how it affects people across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/madeleine-ngo">More about Madeleine Ngo</a></span></p></div><div><p>Christina Jewett covers the Food and Drug Administration, which means keeping a close eye on drugs, medical devices, food safety and tobacco policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett">More about Christina Jewett</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Rebecca Davis O’Brien covers labor and the work force for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rebecca-davis-obrien">More about Rebecca Davis O’Brien</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>America vs. The World:</strong> President Trump shows how far he is willing to take ‘America First,’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-america-first.html">fraying alliances across the globe</a> with his words and actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crypto Reserve Plan:</strong> The prospect of using taxpayer money to stockpile cryptocurrencies in a national reserve has drawn criticism from lawmakers and investors. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/dealbook/trump-crypto-reserve-what-we-know.html">Here’s what we know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulating Infant Formula</strong><strong>:</strong> The new head of the Food and Drug Administration division that regulates infant formula <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/fda-infant-formula-kyle-diamantas.html">was recently a corporate lawyer defending a top formula maker</a> from claims that its product gave rise to debilitating harm to premature babies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fears of Interference: </strong>Comments from Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, have renewed concerns that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/economy/gdp-data-lutnick-commerce-secretary.html">could seek to interfere with federal statistics</a> — especially if they start to show that the economy is slipping into a recession.</p></li><li><p><strong>Top F.B.I.
