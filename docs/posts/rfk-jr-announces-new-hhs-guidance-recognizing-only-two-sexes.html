    <h1>RFK Jr. Announces New HHS Guidance Recognizing Only Two Sexes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The announcement came in response to an executive order Mr. Trump issued on Jan. 20 that gave the health department 30 days to issue “clear guidance” to the public on how to interpret sex-based definitions. “These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,” the order declared.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Kennedy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/rfk-speaks-hhs.html" title="">delivered a welcome address</a> to department employees in which he said his agency would work toward helping Americans “to discover our own paths to living our fullest lives, unleashing the potential in every one of us to make good personal choices that allow us to nourish, to heal and to develop ourselves.”</p><p>There are roughly 1.6 million youths and adults in the United States who identify as transgender, according to an <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimate by the Williams Institute</a> at the U.C.L.A. School of Law. Mr. Trump’s predecessor, President Joseph R. Biden Jr., made protecting transgender people a cornerstone of federal policy.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s assistant secretary for health, Dr. Rachel Levine, a pediatrician, made history by becoming the first transgender person to be confirmed by the Senate to a federal position.</p><p>Mr. Trump has rapidly reversed Biden administration policies. He has followed up his Jan. 20 executive order with a string of others aimed at stripping away the rights of transgender people in almost every corner of American life — including schools, hospitals, prisons, the military and housing.</p></div></div>
