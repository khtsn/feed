    <h1>Hulu’s “English Teacher” Co-star, Stephanie Koenig, and Her Three Wedding Rings</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In the car on the way to her first proposal, Stephanie Koenig, who stars in “English Teacher” on Hulu, asked her soon-to-be fiancé, Chris Riggi, “You’re not proposing, are you?”</p><p>“No, God no,” he said. Mr. Riggi was, in fact, about to propose.</p><p>But first, as he walked Ms. Koenig in freezing temperatures (without their winter coats) toward Mirror Lake in Lake Placid, N.Y., he slipped on ice and hit his head. After he proposed and Ms. Koenig said yes, the freshly engaged couple found themselves locked out of their car. They called an Uber and were half an hour late to an elaborate Thanksgiving dinner hosted by Mr. Riggi’s parents, who, because they didn’t know about the proposal, were annoyed by the tardiness. After the couple announced their news, all was forgiven.</p><p>A few months later, Mr. Riggi wanted a proposal re-do and, she said, botched that one too. Ms. Koenig married Mr. Riggi with two engagement rings — her great grandmother’s wedding ring on her left hand, a garnet on her right — and a wedding band with diamonds from Mr. Riggi’s parents. In an interview that has been edited and condensed, Ms. Koenig talks about her attachment to all three rings.</p><p><strong>Describe your first engagement ring.</strong></p><p>One is an antique, almost like a band of very small, I guess, they’re diamonds, but you wouldn’t even know.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>And your second engagement ring?</strong></p><p>This is a red garnet oval ring on a gold band, but then a silver platform that’s holding the garnet.</p><p><strong>What about your actual wedding ring?</strong></p><p>It’s a flat oval. It’s got a circular diamond with two square diamonds on the side. And I designed it with this jeweler in Grand Rapids, Mich., who I think is splendid. His name is Michael Hoffman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="stephanie koenig looking down with both her hands up to show off her three rings" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 684w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/07/multimedia/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz/07POM-STEPHANIE-KOENIG-04-cqtz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1367w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/5f87e99b-d6d6-5696-8fb1-13169db92b0c" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I’m a nail biter, digging in the dirt, playing ball kind of person,” said Stephanie Koenig about her usual aversion to wearing jewelry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriella Angotti-Jones for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo of the wedding day of Ms. Koenig’s grandmother. “So I have his mom and his dad’s diamonds on my ring, with my great-grandma and my mom’s ring.

My mom grew up with it on her hand because her mom gave it to her, and it’s super old and it’s worth nothing and it’s worth everything to me.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It’s really special to me because I don’t wear jewelry. I’m a nail biter, digging in the dirt, playing ball kind of person. So when my husband was going to ask me to marry him, my parents kept asking me, “What are you going to do? What kind of ring do you want?” I was like, “I don’t wear jewelry. Maybe he can get me a watch.” And they’re like, “You don’t wear watches.” I’m like, “I don’t know, a headband?”</p><p>And then I said, “If I was going to get a ring, Mom, it would be like that ring that you have — it would be tiny, nothing.” When my parents were visiting in L.A., I remember her being like, “Do you want it? Do you want to take it?&#34;</p><p><strong>Then Chris proposed a second time with the garnet.</strong></p><p>So basically what happened with this one is, he wanted to redo. I didn’t know this. He took me to Santa Barbara, and he’s kind of acting weird again at dinner. I’m like, “Chris, are you proposing again? I want to remind you that we are engaged. We’ve told everybody.”</p><p>He proposed again to redo the story, but again, he botched it, and I love it. I want him to keep asking me to marry him, because then each ring gets a new story.</p><p><strong>Tell me about the third ring, your wedding ring.</strong></p><p>This third ring was really special. His dad, who has since died, was sick with cancer and we were really wanting to have a wedding with him around. And so we quickly planned that we were going to do it in his backyard. And his dad was like, “It would mean a lot to me if I could also give Stephanie a diamond,” because he had a ring of diamonds. And then his mom was like, “Well, I want to give her diamonds. I have rings with diamonds.” So I have his mom and his dad’s diamonds on my ring, with my great-grandma and my mom’s ring. There’s just so much to these rings.</p><p>So they all are family experiences, and that’s what marriage is, too: your families coming together, and each, the product of both of them, and they’re all hugging you and giving you their blessing to marry.</p><p><strong>What would happen if you lost one of these rings?</strong></p><p>If I ever lose these rings, I can’t replace the sentimentality. Chris lost his ring, his wedding ring. He was tubing and kind of doing this showing-off move where he was on his knees and dragging his hand on the water. He’s like, “I did lose my ring in Gold Lake.” We circled back around to see if it was floating. Now, he’s got silicone ones.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
