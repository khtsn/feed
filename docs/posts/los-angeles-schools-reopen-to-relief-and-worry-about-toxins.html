Roughly two-thirds of the district’s 14,000 students and about half of its roughly 3,000 staff members live in areas that were under evacuation or warnings.</p><p>One of the schools was Willard Elementary School in Pasadena, where multiple students and staff members lost their homes, said the principal. Maricela Brambila.</p><p>Gabriela De La Torre, 44, made sure to get her daughter, 7, and son, 9, to school on time, even though they are staying with relatives an hour away after losing their home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It gives us at least something where my kids feel safe,” she said. “At least something is somewhat back to normal.”</p><p>And in many ways, it did look like a normal school day. One little boy’s backpack bounced as he ran toward the blue doorway of his school. The crossing guard, wearing a neon cap, directed traffic. Parents congregated outside after drop-off to chat.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
