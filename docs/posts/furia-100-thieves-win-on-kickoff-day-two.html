</span>. A substitute roster took FURIA to map three, while 100 Thieves fought a close three-map series of its own against LEV.</p>



<p>This match was not only the debut of the new FURIA roster for 2026, but also showed a substitute roster for KRÜ due to visa issues. To address this issue, KRÜ fielded a replacement roster. Some notable players included both <span data-ref-id="4">

</span>, the organization&#39;s academy team.</p>

<p>The series started on Pearl, with KRÜ selecting a composition revolving around double-Duelist while FURIA opted for a Chamber comp with double-Initiator. FURIA won the first pistol convincingly, but were unable to convert the bonus off of four kills from Governor. KRÜ soon took their first lead of the match, but FURIA held down B site to keep the map close. A clean thrifty from KRÜ tied the game at 4-4, then <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/38857/beng">
		benG	</a>
</span> started to heat up and won his team two key rounds to end the first half up 7-5.</p>


<p><em>benG puts KRÜ ahead on Pearl.</em></p>

<p>Now on the attack side, FURIA won its second pistol on Pearl to put the team in a great position to take control of the map. After an <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/48025/alym">
		alym	</a>
</span> ace on Neon, the set attack strats from FURIA were working wonders to start. That was, until KRÜ won another big thrifty round, tied the game 10-10, and shot three FURIA members down after to take a late lead. infiltrator hit a clean triple kill to put KRÜ on map point, which they converted.</p>

<p>The team with three academy players and two stand-ins won 13-10 on Pearl, putting pressure on FURIA to reverse sweep. Despite a great performance from <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/3722/koalanoob">
		koalanoob	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/5957/artzin">
		artzin	</a>
</span>, benG was the catalyst for this map win, with multiple clutches and an amazing Astra performance.</p>

<p>The second map was Breeze, which was FURIA&#39;s map pick. FURIA picked a comp revolving around Jett and Yoru double-Duelist, while KRÜ now ran Chamber in a flip of map one&#39;s compositions. FURIA won the first pistol flawlessly, with the same ease as the start of Pearl. Back on the Chamber, <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/1294/nagz">
		NagZ	</a>
</span> helped KRÜ win the bonus round, in a true flashback of the KRÜ of yesteryear. A 1v3 clutch from artzin kept the momentum toward FURIA, but this KRÜ team continued to fight tooth and nail to once again enter the half up 7-5.</p>

<p>FURIA won the fourth pistol in a row, putting the team in the same position as map one. FURIA also converted the bonus, forcing another KRÜ timeout after taking the lead. However, unlike the last game, FURIA kept the lead and shut KRÜ down to win Breeze 13-8.</p>


<p><em>FURIA wins Breeze to force map three.</em></p>

<p>This all led to a game-deciding map on Abyss, with FURIA running a Waylay double-Controller composition while KRÜ ran a double-Initiator comp with Chamber and Yoru. FURIA won its fifth straight pistol round, but infiltrator got four kills to convert the eco.</p>


<p><em>infiltrator converts a big early eco against FURIA.</em></p>

<p>FURIA fought back off some strong rounds from artzin and koalanoob, and a triple kill from <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/754/nerve">
		nerve	</a>
</span> on round six forced a timeout. Post-timeout, KRÜ improved with more aggressive plays from the Yoru and Chamber, and nearly forced a tied game at the half if it wasn&#39;t for a needless death from benG. Back-to-back clutches from FURIA led to an 8-4 lead at the half.</p>

<p>The final pistol of the series was the sixth win in a row for FURIA, putting the team in an ideal position to win. KRÜ stopped the bonus conversion from FURIA, down 10-5 and needing a big comeback to win the series. In the end, while infiltrator tried his best, alym stepped up as FURIA secured the map 13-5 and completed the reverse sweep win. </p>

<p>Across both teams, the star of the series was artzin, who played well across all three maps and stepped up to top frag on map two when his team needed it most. He ended the series with 52 kills, a 1.31 match rating, 221 ACS, and a standout Breeze.</p>



<p>This matchup between two teams with historical regional success also had a bit of a caveat to it, mainly due to <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/29243/neon">
		Neon	</a>
</span> from LEVIATÁN not being of age to play in VCT. However, Neon will turn 18 12 days after this match, so he won&#39;t miss too much of the season. </p>

<p>Starting on Bind, 100 Thieves chose a comp with Chamber and double-Controller while LEVIATÁN ran double-Duelist with Yoru and Waylay. LEV won the first pistol, but <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/3880/bang">
		bang	</a>
</span> converted the eco for 100T on his return to his old team. After the eco round win, both <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/4147/cryocells">
		Cryocells	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/20140/vora">
		vora	</a>
</span> started to heat up, extending the lead for 100T. It seemed like no matter what LEV tried, 100 Thieves were finding a way to win.</p>


<p><em>100 Thieves extend the lead on Bind.</em></p>

<p>100 Thieves entered the half up 9-3, putting LEV in a tough position. LEV did win the second pistol, but 100T converted the eco for the second time in the map. 100 Thieves looked just as dominant on Bind as it has in the past, reaching map point up 12-4. There was a bit of a comeback from LEV, but it ended with 100T winning the map 13-9.</p>

<p>Pearl was next, with 100 Thieves running Chamber and Waylay with double-Initiator while LEV ran a similar comp, with the only difference being a different variation of double-Initiator. LEV started the map strong once again, winning the pistol, but 100T converted its third straight eco round in the series. A rough series for LEV and eco rounds, and its coach looked dejected as 100T developed another lead. Somebody needed to step up on LEV for the team to have a chance, and it was the star duelist <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/21659/sato">
		Sato	</a>
</span> with an ace on Waylay to pull the half back within reach.</p>


<p><em>Sato aces 100 Thieves on Waylay.</em></p>

<p>LEV fought back to only enter the half down 7-5, but needed to win a pistol and convert the antieco to tie the map early on in the second half. So, when the fourth straight pistol win came in, all eyes were on the antieco. It nearly collapsed for a fourth straight time, but some good utility from Sato stopped an attempted site retake. Then, when LEV converted the bonus, that poor start to the first half felt like ages ago, as they took an 8-7 lead. For the first time in the game, 100T were truly on the backfoot. After some standout rounds from spikezN and Sato, LEV won the map 13-10 and took the series to map three.</p>

<p>The series came down to Split, with 100 Thieves bringing back Sage on Split with double-Controller as LEV ran double-Duelist. LEV continued its pistol success rate, but the fifth pistol led to the fourth antieco loss of the series. Even then, just like map one, Split was lots of traded rounds that led to a tied 6-6 half. </p>

<p>100T finally won its first pistol of the series, but LEV prevented the bonus round conversion to keep the game within reach. Even then, 100 Thieves were using the Sage well to prevent the potential fast hits from LEV, and with Timotino hitting great shots when the fights were chaotic, the team was in control. Reaching double digits, <span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/29893/timotino">
		Timotino	</a>
</span> put 100T close to victory by forcing Sato off the spike with no time to replant after.</p>


<p><em>Timotino wins a round by scaring Sato off the plant.</em></p>

<p>When vora nailed a big 1v3 clutch to secure Split, it was the cherry on top. 100 Thieves won Split 13-9 and the series 2-1, moving the team on in the upper bracket of Kickoff to face G2 Esports. With the loss, LEVIATÁN moves to the middle bracket.</p>
