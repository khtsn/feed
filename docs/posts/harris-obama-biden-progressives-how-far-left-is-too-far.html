The “resistance” and social-justice liberalism of the Trump years led to the ideological hodgepodge of the Joe Biden years, which matched a leftward lurch on economic policy with a moderate figurehead and produced the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644252/biden-13th-quarter-approval-average-lowest-historically.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lowest</a> late-term approval ratings average in recent political history.</p><p>In trying to draw lessons from that roller-coaster, some have focused on the fact that Harris, riding a remarkable wave of voter excitement, has chosen to plot a more cautious policy course than she did as a candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2020. After she picked Tim Walz as her running mate, Republicans attacked him on similar grounds — criticizing him as “<a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184646/donald-trump-kevin-mccarthy-tim-walz-bernie-sanders" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Bernie Sanders of Congress</a>,” despite his moderate record in the House and as governor of Minnesota, a blue state, in a time of left-wing ferment, as being too permissive toward the George Floyd protests and for approving driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Put aside, for a moment, that Trump actually <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tim-walz-trump-audio-riots-george-floyd-3b349ec2a8611f242333b76512a82d4f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">praised Walz’s</a> handling of those protests in 2020. These are familiar right-wing attacks, but what is most striking about this wave of them is that they echo a broader critique increasingly now taken as conventional wisdom across the wide center of the political spectrum — that sometime between the end of the Obama years and the Biden midterms, the left went too far. Occasionally, this is <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/can-kamala-harris-win-campaign-strategy-trump-obama.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">framed</a> as an economic critique — that the progressive left abandoned neoliberalism for something much less productive. More often, it’s framed in terms of the fight for social justice and the belief that terms like “BIPOC” and “intersectionality,” imported from the activists and the NGO-sphere, turned normie voters off. The progressive fever reached a peak in the summer of 2020, the thinking goes, and the party is still in a state of prolonged recovery, damaged by the excesses of that period and today needing to stiff-arm the left to win in 2024.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But did progressives actually overstep? Was the party pulled too far from the country’s center of political gravity? You can assess the claim morally, in which case your answer may well be that the left didn’t go far enough. The political stakes of these arguments are high, since they are already shaping the Harris campaign and could well determine the direction of the next presidency and the future of the Democratic Party beyond. For its part, the Harris campaign has seemed to answer in two ways, tacking toward the center on some policy issues but also making a much more emphatic claim that today’s Democrats represent the natural, common-sense “center” of the country’s politics. For the purposes of this column, I wanted to ask the question purely in pragmatic terms: Did the activism and ideology of that period ultimately prove counterproductive, and is there evidence that the Democratic Party suffered politically as a result? Almost five years on, it is much harder to answer those questions in the affirmative than you might think.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter protests, the largest in American history, were also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/06/14/support-for-the-black-lives-matter-movement-has-dropped-considerably-from-its-peak-in-2020/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overwhelmingly popular</a> at first, and while support flattened out over time, academic research suggests that they were, on net, beneficial to Democrats that November. There was no mass defunding of American Police Departments. Instead, to the degree that crime surges that year and the next can be linked to those protests, and not just pandemic social disarray, it <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-murder-spike-of-2020-when-police-pull-back-11626969547" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increasingly</a> <a href="https://dc.law.utah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1216&amp;context=scholarship" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seems</a> to be that in response to them, Police Departments retreated from their duties. Are we supposed to call that left-wing excess or right-wing sabotage? Some studies suggest that the protests “radicalized” liberals without having any appreciable effect on conservative opinion, with others showing that those communities exposed to more anti-protest coverage from right-wing Sinclair broadcasts were less likely to support Republican candidates. On the whole, according to <a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/pushed-and-pulled/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polling and analysis by Democracy Fund</a>, opinions on racial issues appear to have moved leftward under Trump and then basically stayed there under Biden — with none of the backlash you might’ve expected once a Democratic president came in. The “Great Awokening” hasn’t died out but mostly persisted. And the subject appears less polarizing now, too: According to the Democracy Fund, among Democrats, concern for racial justice and police reform is lower than in 2020, while among Republicans, it is higher.</p><p>Pandemic backlash was a common talking point starting in the spring of 2020. But only one Democratic governor anywhere in the country was voted out of office in 2022, in the aftermath of the pandemic emergency, and at the national level conventional wisdom now <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/541005-lucky-adviser-described-covid-19-as-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-biden/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holds that</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54782631" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Covid politics</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/45702/chapter-abstract/398113244?redirectedFrom=fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were a boon</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a burden</a>, to Biden’s 2020 campaign, helping grease the way for Trump’s defeat. Ron DeSantis made a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/23682263/ron-desantis-covid-19-vaccines-joseph-ladapo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national name</a> for himself in part by staking out an “anti-lockdown” position, and there are still residual frustrations across the political spectrum with circa-2020 public-health restrictions on everyday life. But aside perhaps from Glenn Youngkin defeating Terry McAuliffe in 2021 — an election in which “critical race theory” was emphasized even more than public health matters — and Joe Lombardo unseating Steve Sisolak in Nevada in 2022, no major political campaign has been centrally contested, let alone won, on the basis of Covid policy, whose salience declined almost as quickly as the pandemic emergency itself abated. These days, you tend to hear more about school closings than about mitigation per se — but American parents remained on the whole <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2023/9/5/23859890/parents-polling-surveys-schools-american-education-pandemic/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very happy</a> with the education of their children all through the pandemic, and still are.</p><p>Some climate activists who helped push decarbonization to the center of the party’s agenda remain frustrated with the compromises embedded in the Inflation Reduction Act, much as single-payer advocates were disappointed in Obamacare a decade ago — and yet comparing the two legislative sagas is illuminating. The health-care reform of the 2010s generated a political backlash that dominated several election cycles; the climate action of the I.R.A. hasn’t produced anything like that response. More recently, though he sometimes <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/drill-baby-drill-donald-trump-oil-gas-rnc/story?id=112108980" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">erroneously</a> blames Biden for suppressing oil and gas production, Trump has declared himself a fan of electric vehicles, out of deference to Elon Musk, and 18 House Republicans have sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson urging him not to repeal any of the green-energy tax credits in the I.R.A. Democrats never got around to banning your hamburger, it turns out, and the fact that Republicans still sometimes invoke that joke — which appeared in a leaked F.A.Q. written in a congressional office in 2019 — is a sign that the Democrats’ actual climate legislation didn’t offer them very much real to complain about. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/opinion/willow-oil-project-alaska-climate-change.html" title="">Perhaps to a fault.</a>)</p><p>In the 2020 primary campaign, a few Democratic candidates <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/presidential-candidate-castro-calls-for-decriminalizing-border-crossings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">articulated</a> pretty radical views on immigration policy (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger-ebook/dp/B082ZR6827" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as did some center-left pundits</a>). But Julián Castro did not win the nomination or come anywhere close, and Biden’s border policy has proved surprisingly consistent with his predecessor’s. Trump launched his first campaign at a time when cross-border immigration was probably the lowest it had been since the 1970s, and last year, when levels were <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/15/migrant-encounters-at-the-us-mexico-border-hit-a-record-high-at-the-end-of-2023/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highest</a>, single-handedly spiked legislation to bring it under control. Immigration remains a political <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/16/trump-republicans-immigration-00168838" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weapon</a> for Republicans and a political loser for Democrats — indeed to a much larger degree than it was in 2016, when voters barely preferred Trump on the issue, or 2020, when more Americans believed immigration should grow than thought it should shrink. But if 2020 is supposed to be the high-water mark for progressive derangement about the border, the party’s leftward drift was not out of step but perfectly in line with the country as a whole, which — at least to trust the polls — had never viewed new arrivals more sympathetically.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In the years since, national attitudes have changed, but it’s a stretch to lay those changes at the feet of open-borders advocates or the candidates for the Democratic nomination. In the aftermath of the pandemic emergency, millions more people have come to the American border, partly because the United States had one of the only booming economies in the world. These are numbers that would have provoked the backlash of immigration skeptics no matter the policy context, and it is worth keeping in mind that anti-immigration sentiment has become a driver of domestic politics across wealthy countries around the world.</p><p>You can, if you choose, tell all this as a story of triangulation — the Democratic Party and especially its leaders strategically distancing themselves from those who looked to them like kryptonite on the left. In 2020, notably, the party picked one of its most conservative contenders for the nomination, then watched as he forged a conspicuous public alliance with his left-wing critics. Once in office, he made a break with the austerity-minded orthodoxy of party centrists, delivering a historic federal spending spree that at least temporarily achieved huge progress against wealth inequality and continued strides against child poverty and in legislation that the voting public seems nevertheless almost entirely unaware of. In launching her quick-sprint presidential campaign, Harris has discarded many of the progressive commitments she made in her 2020 run, though she has also been pretty mum on the legislative achievements of the current administration and her centrist boss. Two members of the Squad, Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman, have been defeated in Democratic primaries, partly as a consequence of their criticism of Israel’s conduct in Gaza. But one of the party’s more outspoken critics of antiwar protesters, Josh Shapiro, was just passed over as a vice-presidential choice partly, it seems, out of fear that his positioning was problematic, as well. Taken altogether, is this the story of progressives self-immolating, centrists being persuaded to take a few steps leftward, the party establishment policing the fringe of its coalition or some improvisational and unsettled hybrid of all three?</p><p>Of course, there have been some rightward vibe shifts. In the corporate world, you can find an ambient frustration with D.E.I., and even after the Supreme Court’s ruling against affirmative action in higher education, some lingering anger among the country’s meritocrats about the various biases shaping college admissions and the demographic makeup of elite universities. In polls, questions about gender identity and trans rights are generally now answered more conservatively than they were five or 10 years ago. The billionaire class has grown more comfortable embracing Trumpism, at least in public and especially in certain corners of Silicon Valley, where business is increasingly seen as a Promethean world-building exercise in which venture-capital titans struggle against the resentments of a loser class.</p><p>But even these are largely complaints about cultural norms, aimed at bureaucracies and institutions adjacent to but outside the realm of electoral politics. And in that narrower realm, whatever woke backlash there might have been seems to have been canceled out, on net, by the backlash to the backlash — by distaste for “anti-woke” politics, exemplified by liquidated school libraries and the war on Disney, which now appear well past their peak, too. The presidential election appears still nerve-rackingly close, with most reputable forecasters suggesting something much more like a tossup than many Democratic voters now believe it to be. But whatever happens, it is unlikely to look much like Richard Nixon sailing to victory in 1972 on tailwinds from the antiwar movement, urban disorder and racial backlash. If 2020 was a fever, in historical context it appears to be a relatively mild one. And if Kamala Harris does secure the approval of the American public, by Election Day 2028 Republican candidates for president will have won the popular vote only once in four decades.</p><hr/></div></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/14/opinion/obama-harris-progressives.html">252</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/14/opinion/obama-harris-progressives.html">252</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
