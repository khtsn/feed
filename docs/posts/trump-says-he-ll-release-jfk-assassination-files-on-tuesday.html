Kennedy on Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Trump did not provide additional details on what the trove of files would include, but he has long promised to release the unredacted documents.</p><p>“You got a lot of reading,” he said during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/arts/music/trump-kennedy-center-visit.html" title="">a visit to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a>, the cultural and political institution that he took over nearly five weeks ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-kennedy-center.html" title="">installing himself as chairman</a>. “I don’t believe we’re going to redact anything.”</p><p>Days after starting his second term in the White House, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-declassify-jfk-mlk-assassinations.html" title="">signed an executive order</a> mandating the release of all government records related to the assassination of Mr. Kennedy; Mr. Kennedy’s brother, Senator Robert F. Kennedy; and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>John F. Kennedy’s assassination, in particular, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/jfk-files-assassination.html" title="">has long fueled conspiracy theories</a>, including some that Mr. Trump himself has indulged. Historians, too, have eagerly awaited the release of the documents, hoping to learn more about the murder of a sitting president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A 1992 law required the government to release documents related to the President Kennedy assassination within 25 years, except documents that could harm national security. In 2017, Mr. Trump released some additional documents, but he also gave the intelligence agencies more time to assess the files. </p><p>The National Archives and Records Administration has said the government has released 99 percent of the roughly 320,000 documents that have been reviewed since 1992. But there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/16/us/politics/biden-jfk-assassination-papers.html" title="">still thousands of documents</a> that have remained fully or partially withheld.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager">More about Tyler Pager</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
