In order to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to deport millions of immigrants — “Millions and and millions of criminal aliens.” — ICE leaders sped up recruitment. How did they do it? An extensive ad campaign and $50,000 signing bonuses. “When I pull up with no knife because I bring guns to fight.” In less than a year, they have more than doubled the number of ICE officers and agents in the country. At the same time, they cut their training period by more than half. And ICE’s leadership has pressured officers to hit arrest quotas — a practice that many police departments have abandoned. We’re seeing the results “He’s not doing anything.” “Stupid. Come out here.” “I’ve got my baby.” “Bro!” In just a year, Trump has remade an American law enforcement agency into an unrestrained, unaccountable force. It’s a step toward becoming a police state. “Were you born here?” One where law enforcement officials routinely smash car windows — “This person’s [EXPLETIVE] window.” — put people in chokeholds — “He can’t breathe.” — detain American citizens for days at a time — “I’m a U.S. citizen.” — and, yes, even fatally shoot a driver in her car, without launching a serious federal investigation into the officer’s conduct. This is a situation where Congress can do something, and some Democrats are pushing for reform. “We cannot continue with business as usual.” “There are a variety of different things that can be done.” But even if they’re successful, ICE’s new culture will be hard to change. Most law enforcement officials in the United States pride themselves on being professional public servants, with the aim of reducing fear and creating a sense of order in their communities. ICE, on the other hand, is creating terror and chaos. And one year into Trump’s second term, that seems to have been their goal all along.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><header><div><div><div><nyt-betamax><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template><nyt-betamax-cover><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template><nyt-betamax-poster><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-jumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75" data-testid="betamax-poster" sizes="(width &lt; 740px) 95vw, 500px" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-master180.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 180w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-blog225.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 225w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-popup.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 282w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-slide.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 282w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-master315.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 315w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-tmagSF.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 362w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-blog427.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 427w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-blog480.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 480w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-master495.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 495w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-blog533.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 533w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-jumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 576w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-tmagArticle.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 592w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-articleLarge.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-master675.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 675w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-master768.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 768w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-master1050.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 1050w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/arts/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb/17-dmt-ICE-Edition_thumb-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 1080w" fetchpriority="high"/></template></nyt-betamax-poster></nyt-betamax-cover><nyt-betamax-overlay-controls><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template></nyt-betamax-overlay-controls><nyt-betamax-ads><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template></nyt-betamax-ads></nyt-betamax></div><div><p><span>By doubling its force while slashing training time, ICE has scaled up its culture of violence into an unrestrained and unaccountable machine.</span></p><p>By Kathleen Kingsbury, Lauren Dominguez Chan and Ingrid Holmquist</p><p>January 16, 2026</p></div></div></div></header></div></div></div></div>
