    <h1>Federal Debt and the Election</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><p>Sometime in the next two years, the federal debt will likely cross a worrisome threshold: It will exceed the size of the country’s annual economic output (or G.D.P.) for the first time since 1946.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The debt-to-G.D.P. ratio is merely a statistic, and nothing will inherently change when the ratio exceeds 100 percent. But it will be a sign of the country’s serious budget challenges. The large debts of the 1940s had a clear rationale: They were the price of winning a world war against a murderous fascist alliance. Today’s debt has no such simple explanation.</p><p>It instead reflects an accumulation of causes, including large tax cuts signed by Republican presidents, the continued rise in spending on Medicare and Social Security as the country ages and stimulus bills passed by both parties during the Covid pandemic and 2007-9 financial crisis. (Spending on the military, by contrast, has declined as a share of G.D.P. in recent years.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>What these causes have in common is a federal government that seems incapable of paying its own bills — and an electorate that tells pollsters it cares about the federal debt but votes for politicians who support low taxes and high spending.</p><h2 id="link-653c51d">How bad?</h2><p>Yesterday, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — a group that favors deficit reduction — <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a detailed analysis</a> of both Trump’s and Kamala Harris’s economic plans. The group acknowledged the uncertainty about the effects of those plans. Both candidates have been vague about parts of their agendas, and the economy’s performance will also have a big impact on the debt.</p><p>In the most likely scenarios, however, Harris’s plans would add meaningfully to the debt — and Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/trump-economic-plans-debt-costs.html" title="">would add much more to the debt</a>. Harris has proposed a mix of spending programs focused on the middle class and tax increases on the rich that would not fully pay for her spending plans; Trump has proposed a large tax cut focused on the affluent and not nearly enough spending cuts or tariffs to pay for it.</p><p>This chart shows the central forecasts from Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget as well as its uncertainty ranges:</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Note: Excludes debt the federal government owes itself | Source: Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>I know that the federal debt can be a hard topic to think about, partly because budget scolds have been warning for years that it is too large. Then it keeps growing, and nothing bad seems to happen. Those scolds can sound like Aesop’s boy who cried wolf.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But it’s worth remembering what happens at the end of that fable: Eventually, the boy was telling the truth, and a wolf really did come to eat the town’s sheep. Likewise, the federal government will eventually face consequences for spending more money than it raises in taxes.</p><p>Already, the costs of high federal debt are evident. About one-seventh of all federal spending this year will cover interest payments on debt the government previously accumulated. That’s almost as much as it will spend this year on Medicare and more than it will spend on the military. (Social Security remains almost twice as expensive as Medicare, the military or debt interest.)</p><p>Over time, interest payments will account for an even larger share of the federal budget, leaving less money for everything else. The interest payments mean that the longer the government waits to deal with its growing debt, the more painful the solution will need to be.</p><h2 id="link-15b2b266">More tax, less spending</h2><p>What are the potential solutions?</p><p>A small group of progressive economists — who favor an idea known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/30/opinion/theres-no-real-ceiling-for-federal-debt-im-not-so-sure.html" title="">modern monetary theory</a>, or M.M.T. — argue that the Treasury can simply print enough money to repay the debt. But even these advocates acknowledge that doing so could spark inflation, and the past few years have shown how damaging inflation can be, both economically and politically. M.M.T. doesn’t actually seem to be the answer.</p><p>A more plausible solution is the obvious one: Some combination of tax increases and spending cuts. And it isn’t especially hard to imagine what that combination might look like. It would need to restrain the growth of Medicare and Social Security, already the federal government’s largest budget items and growing rapidly, and it would need to raise taxes. The tax increases could be targeted at the wealthy and corporations, which have received big tax cuts in the past several decades, but they couldn’t necessarily be limited to the wealthy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The debt, to be clear, isn’t the only long-term challenge facing the country. Climate change is a major threat, as the recent procession of hurricanes shows once again. The rise of an ambitious alliance of autocracies, including China, Iran and Russia, is also a threat. Ultimately, all these challenges overlap: The more money that the U.S. spends on interest payments, the less is available for clean energy, national defense and other priorities.</p><h2 id="link-24f4bb57">More on the election</h2><ul><li><p>On CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Harris was asked about the criticism that she has changed some policies in recent years.
