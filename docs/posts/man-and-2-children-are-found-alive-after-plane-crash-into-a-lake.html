    <h1>Man and 2 Children Are Found Alive After Plane Crash Into a Lake</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A man and two children who had been missing overnight were rescued on Monday from the wreckage of a plane that crashed into a frozen lake in south-central Alaska, the authorities said.</p><p>The single-engine plane, a Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser, was reported missing just after 10:30 p.m. on Sunday, setting off search and rescue efforts around Tustumena Lake and the Kenai Mountains, some 80 to 100 miles south of Anchorage, the <a href="https://dailydispatch.dps.alaska.gov/Home/DisplayIncident?incidentNumber=AK25026843" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alaska State Troopers said</a> on their website.</p><p>The authorities searched all night, but could not find the plane.</p><p>The next morning, a volunteer pilot found the wreckage on the eastern side of the lake, the Alaska State Troopers said. The Alaska Army National Guard rescued the man and two children, all of whom had non-life-threatening injuries, at 10:30 a.m. Monday and took them to a hospital, the state troopers said.</p><p>Dale Eicher, a pilot who had been searching for the plane, told the local news station <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2025/03/24/plane-with-3-aboard-missing-kenai-peninsula-troopers-say/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KTUU</a> that he was approaching the lake when he heard over the radio that the man and two children had been found alive. Mr. Eicher, assuming that the pilot who had located the group had no cell service, said that he immediately called the Alaska State Troopers to notify them.</p></div></div>
