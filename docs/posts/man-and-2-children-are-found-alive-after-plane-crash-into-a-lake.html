The Alaska Army National Guard rescued the man and two children, all of whom had non-life-threatening injuries, at 10:30 a.m. Monday and took them to a hospital, the state troopers said.</p><p>Dale Eicher, a pilot who had been searching for the plane, told the local news station <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2025/03/24/plane-with-3-aboard-missing-kenai-peninsula-troopers-say/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KTUU</a> that he was approaching the lake when he heard over the radio that the man and two children had been found alive. Mr. Eicher, assuming that the pilot who had located the group had no cell service, said that he immediately called the Alaska State Troopers to notify them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I was really shocked,” Mr. Eicher, told KTUU. “I didn’t expect that we would find them alive, for sure.”</p><p>Neither the pilot nor his family could be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.</p><p>Scott Holmes, described by KTUU as a family friend of the pilot, had posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/scottholmeskenai/posts/pfbid05AEV98TvQAYuxwjULcF2kxqc5X93RGPK1nPX57ycEL9SqR4pbJYkkd5nhA2gnP1pl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message</a> to Facebook on Monday, saying he was doing so on behalf of the pilot’s father.</p><p>“My son is long overdue from a Sunday afternoon flight,” the message said. “My two granddaughters are on board also. There are friends ready to search at daylight. But this is my plea for any and all help to locate my family.”</p><p>Mr. Holmes later updated the post, noting that the plane had gone through the ice, but that the group had been “FOUND AND WALKING AROUND.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Livia Albeck-Ripka is a Times reporter based in Los Angeles, covering breaking news, California and other subjects.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/livia-albeck-ripka">More about Livia Albeck-Ripka</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
