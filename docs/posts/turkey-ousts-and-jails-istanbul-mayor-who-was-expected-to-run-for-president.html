He has denied the accusations against him, which Mr. Erdogan’s opponents have called a ploy to hinder a popular politician’s presidential bid.</p><p>The court ordered that Mr. Imamoglu be jailed on accusations of corruption pending a trial. State prosecutors have accused him of leading a criminal organization and overseeing bribery, bid rigging and other financial misdeeds at City Hall.</p><p>Prosecutors also accused him of supporting terrorism through his political coordination with a pro-Kurdish group during local elections last year. The court chose not to order his detention on those charges, but said he is under grave suspicion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Sunday afternoon, the Interior Ministry removed Mr. Imamoglu from office. </p><p>Detention alone may not prevent him from running for president, but he faces other roadblocks. The day before his arrest, his alma mater, Istanbul University, voided his diploma, citing improper procedures in his transfer to the school in 1990. Turkey’s Constitution stipulates that the president must have completed higher education. The mayor said before he was detained that he would contest the ruling.</p><p>Mr. Imamoglu, who has been elected mayor three times since 2019, faces a slew of other court cases as well, including some that could temporarily bar him from politics.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ekrem_imamoglu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>, the mayor called on Turks to stand together against “this black stain on our democracy.”</p><p>Of his detention, he said: “I stand tall. I will never bow.”</p><p>Critics of Mr. Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than two decades, have long accused him of using state power to undermine his rivals. But, they say, arresting a presidential contender to undermine him in the race before it begins represents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/middleeast/turkey-erdogan-democracy-istanbul-mayor-detention.html" title="">a new level of authoritarianism</a>. His arrest has prompted the largest street protests in Turkey in more than a decade, with more , </p><p>Some European leaders have criticized the mayor’s arrest, and they have called on the Turkish government to uphold the rule of law. Senior U.S. officials have said little.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy, made no mention of the mayor’s detention in an <a href="https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1903207340696014945" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with the former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson that was <a href="https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1903207340696014945" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on X</a> on Saturday. But he said that Mr. Trump had recently spoken with Mr. Erdogan. The call was not made public by the White House at the time.</p><p>“There is just a lot of good, positive news coming out of Turkey right now as a result of that conversation,” Mr. Witkoff said, without providing further details.</p><p>The court also jailed dozens of other people, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency, including several of Mr. Imamoglu’s associates. At least four of his close aides were jailed on corruption charges and two others for supporting terrorism, the state-run news media reported.</p><p>Two Istanbul district mayors were also jailed and removed from their posts, bringing the total removed by the government in recent months to five. All of the ousted mayors are from Mr. Imamoglu’s party, which won 26 of Istanbul’s 39 districts in local elections last year.</p><p>Despite Mr. Imamoglu’s detention, Turkey’s main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, or C.H.P., went ahead with a primary on Sunday to designate him its presidential candidate. Party members voted around the country, and the party called on nonparty members to turn out as well to cast symbolic ballots to support the jailed mayor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At one polling station in a neighborhood that Mr. Erdogan’s party won in local elections last year, about 20 people stood in line to cast symbolic votes for Mr. Imamoglu.</p><p>“I am here for our freedom. I am here for my children,” said Hilal Dukmeler, a 26-year-old nurse. “If we keep silent on this one, our republic will not survive.”</p><p>She said Mr. Erdogan’s party had failed to offer services and considered Mr. Imamoglu a threat.</p><p>“This is show of power of the government,” she said. “They realized that Imamoglu has the power too and they tried to beat him.”</p><p>Mr. Erdogan’s current presidential term, his second, expires in 2028. While the Constitution limits presidents to two full terms, he could legally run again if Parliament called for early elections, cutting short his second mandate.</p><p>Many people in Turkey expect that to happen. If it does, it is possible that Mr. Imamoglu, 54, could be barred from the race. Mr. Erdogan, 71, has not said whether he would run, but he has no clear successor and many people in Turkey expect him to seek another term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The removal of Mr. Imamoglu could disrupt the administration of Turkey’s largest city. The city government employs more than 100,000 people and oversees a number of companies that build housing, run public transportation and carry out infrastructure projects.</p><p>Large protests against Mr. Imamoglu’s detention have broken out nightly in cities across Turkey and more were planned for Sunday, despite the government’s efforts to stop them. Public demonstrations have been banned in the country’s three largest cities, social medial access has been restricted and major transit hubs have been closed to hamper the ability of protesters to gather in public squares.</p><p>On Saturday, the Interior Ministry said that 343 people had been arrested while protesting, and the office of Istanbul’s governor, who is appointed by Mr. Erdogan, said travelers “likely to participate in unlawful protests” would be prevented from entering the city.</p><p>Gulsin Harman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>South Korea’s Martial Law: </strong>President Yoon Suk Yeol came close to disabling Parliament with a few hundred troops.
