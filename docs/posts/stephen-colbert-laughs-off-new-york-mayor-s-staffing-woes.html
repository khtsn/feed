Here are the </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/arts/television/best-movies-on-netflix.html" title=""><em>50 best movies on Netflix right now</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="link-53e1fa7c">Rat Race</h2><p>New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, has had a challenging start to his week, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/nyregion/new-york-deputy-mayors-resignations.html" title="">four of his eight deputy mayors</a> announcing their resignations. Stephen Colbert called it the moment when “Adams’s controversies stopped being funny and started becoming hilarious.”</p><blockquote><p>“The resignations were from the first deputy mayor, deputy mayor for health and human services, deputy mayor for operations, and deputy mayor for public safety. So, at this point, the city is evidently being run by the remaining deputy mayor: 100 rats in a trench coat.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><p>The resignations came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/eric-adams-doj-lawyers.html" title="">after several federal prosecutors in the Southern District</a> of New York quit, having come under pressure from the Trump administration to drop charges in the mayor’s corruption case.</p><blockquote><p>“That takes courage. Thankfully, all these lawyers found jobs at the new firm of Wegot, Balls &amp; Howe.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06muRo_gkPM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Colbert reminded viewers that Adams has “been involved in controversy for years now.”</p><blockquote><p>“For instance, while he was running to be the mayor of New York, no one could tell if he lived in New York or New Jersey; once he became mayor, he appointed, and later had to remove, his brother as deputy police commissioner. He announced a personal war on rats, introduced a Times Square RoboCop that failed as a police officer but thrived as a public urinal, and claims that the Big Apple is littered with unique crystals that give out a special energy. Yes, in fact, I saw a gentleman enjoying some of those unique crystals in the Port Authority bathroom yesterday. He definitely radiated a ‘special energy.’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-2a6f9c8c">The Punchiest Punchlines (Reality Bites Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“This is the worst ad I have ever seen. It’s a virtual support group for singles, but it looks like an A.A. meeting for ‘Animal Crossing’ villagers.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON on Meta’s new ad for its VR game, “Horizon Worlds”</em></p><p>“CGI has gotten very good — ‘Avatar,’ ‘Planet of the Apes,’ ‘Sonic the Hedgehog&#39; — get it together! You’re telling me this is the best you can do? It looks like an animated show for children made by even younger children.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“It’s a virtual world — why do the lonely singles have to meet in an abandoned high school gym? Were all the other virtual spaces rented out? I mean, you could have met on the moon.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON</em></p><p>“I guess maybe this is cool for them because it couldn’t happen in the real world, because most “Horizon Worlds” users are not allowed within 500 feet of a school.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON</em></p><p>“The video game division of Meta has lost $70 billion. Yeah, billion with a ‘b,&#39; yeah. Zuckerberg lost the same amount of money a small country makes in a year, and he lost it on a game with animation so bad, it wouldn’t even be shown at a bowling alley after a spare.” <em>— TAYLOR TOMLINSON</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>On his Tuesday show, Greg Gutfeld said that Americans might not like what Trump says, but they approve of what he does.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-1f978490">What We’re Excited About on Wednesday Night</h2></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The drag performer Monét X Change will appear on “After Midnight.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Françoise Hardy has special significance for the writer Lucy Sante.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evening Standard/Hulton Archive, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
