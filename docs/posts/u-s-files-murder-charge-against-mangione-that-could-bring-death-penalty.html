They come two days after the office of the Manhattan district attorney filed state murder charges against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, 26, in the killing of the executive, Brian Thompson. Mr. Thompson, 50, was gunned down on a Manhattan sidewalk this month.</p><p>The highest penalty Mr. Mangione could face if convicted in state court would be life in prison without parole. A spokeswoman for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said on Wednesday that the state case would proceed in parallel with any federal prosecution.</p><p>The charges in the federal complaint accuse Mr. Mangione of traveling across state lines — from Atlanta to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York, where he arrived shortly after 10 p.m. on Nov. 24 — to stalk and ultimately kill Mr. Thompson, which would give the federal government jurisdiction to prosecute him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/19/nyregion/mangione-complaint.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/7e8f7e4706de3bea/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Mangione was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday afternoon before a federal magistrate in Manhattan.</p><p>The new charges came just over two weeks after the predawn killing of Mr. Thompson on Dec. 4.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The indictment contained surveillance pictures of the suspect cycling through Manhattan’s dawn streets.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">United States District Court Southern District of New York</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Surveillance footage showed a gunman approaching Mr. Thompson from behind outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, lifting a handgun fitted with a suppressor and firing at him several times before fleeing.</p><p>The authorities have said the suspect then fled uptown on an e-bike and soon left New York.</p><p>Mr. Mangione was arrested days later in a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pa., as he was eating hash browns and looking at his laptop.
