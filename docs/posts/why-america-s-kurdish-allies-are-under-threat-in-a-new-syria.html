They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which have allied with the United States to combat the extremist Islamic State, and the Syrian National Army, a militia backed by Turkey, which is hostile to the Kurdish forces.</p><p>For more than a decade, the Kurdish-led soldiers have been America’s most reliable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-kurds-history-facts.html" title="">partner in Syria</a>, liberating cities seized by the extremist group and detaining around 9,000 of its fighters.</p><p>But Turkey, which shares a border with Syria, has long considered the Kurdish group to be its enemy.

But American officials and Middle East analysts agree: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-rebels-erdogan.html" title="">Turkey will have an outsized influence</a>.</p><p>That means Kurdish groups’ foothold in the northeast looks increasingly “tenuous,” said Wa’el Alzayat, a Syria expert and former American diplomat. Turkey “will have the biggest leverage in what’s happening, and will happen, in Syria for the foreseeable future,” he said.</p><p>As Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its allies seized control from President Bashar al-Assad, “they brought with them a tide of Turkish power and influence over the future of Syria,” said Nicholas Heras, a senior analyst at the New Lines Institute.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The high stakes for the Kurds, and for Western forces determined to prevent a renewed ISIS threat, were illuminated earlier this past week.

That would further weaken the Kurdish forces.</p><p>A best-case scenario for the Kurds, officials and experts said, might see them receive enough support from the United States to secure the territory they hold in northeast Syria. That could give them leverage with the new government in Damascus to pursue a fully autonomous state, something minority Kurds in Syria have long sought.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At worst, the Kurds could face an inflamed conflict with Turkish-backed fighters, be forced to cede control of at least some of their oil-rich territory and, if President-elect Donald J. Trump decides to withdraw U.S. troops, lose vital help on the ground.</p><h2 id="link-4af8f4e4">America’s role will be pivotal</h2><p>“There really needs to be some kind of cease-fire/peace agreement between the Turks and the Kurds that both sides can agree with,” said Natasha Hall, a Syria expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>The Biden administration is racing to negotiate just that before it leaves office next month.</p><p>Following meetings in Turkey last week, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Saturday that “making sure that ISIS was in a box” remained an urgent priority in Syria. He said the Kurdish fighters were “playing a critical role in pursuing that mission.”</p><p>But the diplomatic balancing act he faced was clear: His meetings in Turkey included talks with the foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, who earlier last week said that “any P.K.K. extension in Syria cannot be considered a legitimate partner.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>And on Friday, Mr. Fidan pointedly cited the P.K.K. as he described efforts to keep terrorist organizations from exploiting the political chaos in Syria.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdish-led fighters backed by the U.S. at a checkpoint in Syria in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Baderkhan Ahmad/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Yet there are signs that American diplomacy is having an impact. Last week, an American commander, Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, <a href="https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1866558899144519822?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visited northeast Syria</a>, where 900 American troops are stationed. Hours later, a cease-fire between the Kurdish forces and a Turkish-backed rebel group known as the Syrian National Army was announced in the northern city of Manbij, where the two sides have frequently clashed.</p><p>General Abdi, the Kurdish commander, <a href="https://x.com/MazloumAbdi/status/1866615394238116008" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a> that the cease-fire was brokered with American help. Under the agreement, he said, Kurdish forces would withdraw from Manbij, a majority Arab city which they seized from the Islamic State in 2016 but that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-invasion-isis.html" title="">since become a flashpoint</a> among battling factions for control. But he and other Syrian ethnic Kurds are increasingly worried that their retreat from Manbij is just the beginning.</p><h2 id="link-1ef2d3a3">The city of Kobani could be the next flashpoint</h2><p>Last Tuesday, a senior Hayat Tahrir al-Sham officer said that <a href="https://t.me/aleamaliaat_aleaskaria/330" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local tribes allied with his group</a> had wrested control of the eastern city of Deir al-Zour from Kurdish fighters who had taken over as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-backed-syrian-kurds-seize-eastern-city-deir-el-zor-sources-say-2024-12-06/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. al-Assad’s forces collapsed</a> just days earlier.</p><p>And in the days since, the Turkish-backed rebels have repeatedly battled with Kurdish forces in the region around the Euphrates River.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Heras, the New Lines analyst, said he thought those skirmishes could be military preparations for an invasion of Kobani, a majority Kurdish city.</p><p>The city, just south of the Turkish border, holds deep emotional significance for the Kurdish forces, who fought with American troops to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/27/world/middleeast/kurds-isis-syria-kobani.html" title="">reclaim it</a> after a four-month Islamic State siege that began in late 2015.</p><p>General Abdi now appears to be <a href="https://x.com/mutludc/status/1866579808131379395" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bracing for a possible invasion</a> by Turkey’s allied fighters. Mr. Heras said residents were fleeing Kobani by the thousands despite a shaky truce agreement this past week that aimed to buy time for negotiations.</p><p>“Turkey is taking advantage of the crisis in Syria to destabilize the region and seize our land, while claiming they are fighting terrorists,” said Sinam Sherkany Mohamad, the head of the Kurdish fighters’ political wing in Washington, in a statement. “But we are not terrorists, we are democratic U.S. allies.”</p><p>James F. Jeffrey, a former American ambassador to Turkey who was a chief Syria envoy during Mr. Trump’s first administration, said any invasion of Kobani would violate a 2019 agreement that the U.S. negotiated for a détente, “and whether by the Turks, or Syrian forces associated with the Turks, it makes no difference.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kobani in 2019.
