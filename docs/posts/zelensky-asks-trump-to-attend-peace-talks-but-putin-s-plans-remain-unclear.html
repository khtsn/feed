Putin of Russia to attend, but he cast doubt on Mr. Putin’s desire for either talks or peace.</p><p>The Kremlin on Tuesday declined to say whether Mr. Putin would travel to for a meeting in Turkey, where peace talks are set for Thursday in Istanbul. “As soon as the president sees it fit, we will announce” the delegation’s makeup, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told Russian news agencies.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said of Mr. Trump, “If he were to confirm his participation, I think it would give an additional push for Putin to come.”</p><p>The talks have taken on growing importance as Russia, Ukraine and the United States have weighed in and goaded each other, each time raising the stakes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Over the weekend, Mr. Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/world/europe/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-talks-putin-zelensky.html" title="">called for direct talks</a> with Ukraine, while ignoring demands by Kyiv and its allies to agree to an immediate cease-fire by Monday or face further sanctions. Mr. Trump publicly prodded Mr. Zelensky to accept the offer of negotiations, but the Ukrainian leader went a step farther on Monday, saying he would travel to Turkey for a face-to-face meeting, and challenging Mr. Putin to do the same.</p><p>Mr. Trump then unexpectedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-ceasefire.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">floated the possibility</a> on Monday that he could take part in the meeting, which will coincide with his scheduled trip this week to the Middle East — an idea Mr. Zelensky swiftly embraced. At the White House, Mr. Trump told reporters, “Don’t underestimate Thursday in Turkey.”</p><p>On Tuesday, speaking to journalists in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky said he and Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, would be waiting for Mr. Putin in Ankara, the Turkish capital, but would also be ready to travel to any city Mr. Putin chooses.</p><p>“So that Russia doesn’t manipulate the situation and claim that Putin is not ready to fly to Ankara and is only willing to go to Istanbul, I want to say right away: If Putin flies to Istanbul instead of the capital, I have already sent a signal to President Erdogan, and the Turkish side is ready,” Mr. Zelensky said. “Erdogan and I will fly to Istanbul.”</p><p>“If Putin is truly ready, not just in the media but in real life, to meet, then at the leaders’ level, we will do everything to agree on a cease-fire,” he added. “Because it is with him that I must negotiate a cease-fire. He is the only one who decides.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Trump administration has been growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress in its efforts to broker a truce between Russia and Ukraine. Mr. Trump recently questioned whether Mr. Putin really wanted to end the war.</p><p>Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had made clear that he “expects” both Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin to be present for talks in Turkey.</p><p>“I believe that if Vladimir Putin refuses to come to Turkey, it will be the final signal that Russia does not want to end this war — that Russia is neither willing nor ready for any negotiations,” Mr. Yermak <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/yaksho-volodimir-putin-vidmovitsya-vid-peregovoriv-u-turechc-97757" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>Kyiv’s European allies have also been ramping up pressure on Moscow to agree to an unconditional 30-day truce, a proposal first made by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-cease-fire.html" title="">the United States</a> in early March that Ukraine accepted. On a visit to Kyiv over the weekend, European leaders said that Mr. Putin had until the end of Monday to agree and that if it did not, further sanctions would be imposed.</p><p>As of Tuesday afternoon, no new sanctions had been announced.</p><p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany gave no indication of how soon the sanctions could be introduced.</p><p>“We are waiting for Mr. Putin’s approval, and we agree that if no real progress is made this week, we will then jointly advocate for a significant tightening of sanctions at the European level,” Mr. Merz said.</p><p>Christopher F.
