After <strong>21</strong> months of fighting, thousands have been killed in a campaign of ethnic cleansing, countless women and girls have been subjected to sexual violence, and millions are hungry, in the world’s first officially declared famine since 2020.</p><p>So many people have been uprooted that the United Nations says Sudan is now home to the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/10/1156211" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world’s largest displacement crisis</a> — a “living nightmare,” in <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/10/1156266#:~:text=Escalating%20violence%20and%20new%20atrocities,situation%20in%20Sudan%20is%20catastrophic." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the words</a> of Amy Pope, director general of the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.</p><h2 id="link-14cc155d">Genocide Old and New</h2><p>The Sudanese army chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan,<span>  </span>were once allies. In 2021, they worked together to stage a military coup. But they later split after failing to merge their forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In April 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/world/africa/sudan-war-army-paramilitary.html" title="">they went to war</a>, with gun battles raging in the capital, Khartoum.</p><p>The R.S.F., as the Rapid Support Forces is known, is composed of the remnants of another militia, the Janjaweed, which was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people two decades ago in the western Darfur region of Sudan. Those killings led to genocide charges at the International Criminal Court against Sudan’s autocratic ruler, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who was overthrown in 2019.</p><p>On Tuesday, the American secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said that the R.S.F., and allied militias had committed <a href="https://www.state.gov/genocide-determination-in-sudan-and-imposing-accountability-measures/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new acts of genocide</a> in Darfur in 2023. The target, officials said, was the Masalit people, a non-Arab ethnic minority in Sudan, where the population and the armed forces are predominantly Arabs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In July 2023, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/world/africa/mass-grave-darfur-sudan.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">mass grave</a> was uncovered, holding the bodies of <strong>87</strong> people, most of them Masalit who rights groups said had likely been killed by the R.S.F. There have also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/world/africa/sudan-darfur-fighting.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">reports</a> of sexual violence, torture and killings of Masalit people.</p><p>Death toll estimates for the war vary widely. Last year — before the recent waves of fighting — the American envoy to Sudan, Tom Perriello, said the number could be as high as <strong>150,000</strong>. In January, 2024, an independent panel of experts <a href="https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n24/005/64/pdf/n2400564.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted a report</a> to the U.N. that said that in December 2023 alone, some <strong>10,000 to 15,000</strong> people had been killed in R.S.F. massacres in El Geneina, a city in West Darfur.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As of last July, at least <strong>33,000</strong> people had been injured in the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/07/1152596#:~:text=The%20conflict%20has%20resulted%20in,the%20population%2C%20facing%20acute%20hunger." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fighting</a>, according to the World Health Organization.

Since the fighting began, over <strong>3.3 million</strong> people have crossed Sudan’s borders into neighboring countries, among them Egypt, Chad and South Sudan.</p><p>More than half of all those displaced are children, the report said. Many are living in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/08/14/world/africa/on-the-ground-with-sudanese-refugees-fleeing-war-and-hunger" title="">dire conditions</a>, with little food or water.
