As she got closer, she saw that the shelves, where there would normally be stacks of egg cartons, were nearly empty.</p><p> “All of the normal-size cartons of eggs were practically gone,” Ms. Modrell said. “I heard some elderly people being really upset.” </p><p>Across the country, shoppers in grocery stores are facing empty shelves and higher prices for what has traditionally been an inexpensive source of protein: eggs. </p><p>And it’s likely to get worse.</p><p>Volatile egg prices have been a part of the grocery shopping experience partly because of inflation, but also because of an avian influenza, or bird flu, that made its way to the United States in 2022. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/health/birdflu-marine-mammals.html" title="">That influenza,</a> caused by the H5N1 virus, has infected or killed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">136 million birds</a> thus far. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the outbreak has recently intensified. More than 30 million chickens — roughly 10 percent of the nation’s egg-laying population — have been killed in just the last three months, to prevent the spread of the disease. It could take months before the supply of egg-laying chickens returns to the normal level of around 318 million, roughly the equivalent of one chicken per person.</p><p>“This is the most devastating wave of the bird flu outbreak we’ve seen since it began to spread three years ago,” said Karyn Rispoli, the egg managing editor at Expana, a firm that collects and tracks the price of eggs. “And this time around farms that cater to the retail sector have been disproportionately impacted and that is leaving a big, gaping hole.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
