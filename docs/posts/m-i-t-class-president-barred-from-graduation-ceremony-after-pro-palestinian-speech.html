The student, Megha Vemuri, is the latest to face discipline after using a graduation as a forum to protest Israel’s war in Gaza.</p><p>At a universitywide ceremony on Thursday at M.I.T.’s campus in Cambridge, Mass., Ms. Vemuri commended students who protested on behalf of Palestinians and denounced M.I.T.’s ties with Israel. <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/04/24/metro/mit-protesters-israeli-investments/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Boston Globe reported last year</a> that based on data from the U.S. Department of Education, M.I.T. reported receiving $2.8 million in grants, gifts and contracts from Israeli entities between 2020 and 2024.</p><p>School officials confirmed that they later told Ms. Vemuri that she was prohibited from attending the undergraduate ceremony on Friday.</p><p>“MIT supports free expression but stands by its decision, which was in response to the individual deliberately and repeatedly misleading Commencement organizers and leading a protest from the stage,” a school spokesperson said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The school said that Ms. Vemuri, who grew up in Georgia, will receive her degree. Sarat Vemuri, her father, said that she was a double major, in computation and cognition and linguistics, and was told that she will receive her diploma by mail.</p><p>He otherwise referred questions to his daughter, who provided a statement saying that she was not disappointed to miss Friday’s ceremony.</p><p>“I see no need for me to walk across the stage of an institution that is complicit in this genocide,” she wrote.</p><p>She added that she was “disappointed” in M.I.T.’s response, saying school officials “massively overstepped their roles to punish me without merit or due process.”</p><p>College campuses have been contending with protest encampments and accusations of antisemitism since the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, and the ensuing war in Gaza. Those tensions, coupled with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">the Trump administration’s attacks on universities</a>, have left some school communities wrestling with how to balance civility and safety with open expression and debate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And at some schools students looking to make a statement have seized on end-of-year ceremonies as a powerful platform, delivering speeches that diverged from the remarks they had told school officials they would make.</p><p>At New York University in mid-May, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/nyregion/nyu-commencement-speaker-pro-palestinian-diploma.html" title="">officials withheld a diploma</a> from, a student, Logan Rozos, after he referred to “the atrocities currently happening in Palestine” in a commencement speech.</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/21/gwu-bans-student-graduation-speech-divestment/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">At George Washington University, a graduate named Cecilia Culver</a> used her speech to urge others to not donate to the school and repeated requests for it to divest from companies doing business in Israel. The university barred her from campus and university-sponsored events.</p><p>At M.I.T., Ms. Vemuri was one of nine speakers at Thursday’s <a href="https://commencement.mit.edu/onemit" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ONEMIT Commencement Ceremony</a>. </p><p>Ms. Vemuri’s speech, read from wrinkled sheets of paper, was about four minutes long and addressed her classmates and some of their efforts to protest Israel.</p><p>“You showed the world that M.I.T. wants a free Palestine,” she said, adding, “the M.I.T. community that I know would never tolerate a genocide.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After Ms. Vemuri left the dais to cheers, Sally Kornbluth, the school president, spoke next. She paused as some in the audience chanted.</p><p>“OK, listen folks,” she said. “At M.I.T., we believe in freedom of expression. But today is about the graduates.”</p><p>Ms. Kornbluth has found herself on this type of tightrope before. In December 2023, she was one of three university presidents called to <a href="https://president.mit.edu/updates/testimony" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testify before the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce</a>. The committee pressed the officials over their responses to campus protests and allegations of antisemitism.</p><p>Ms. Kornbluth managed to avoid the level of criticism levied at Claudine Gay of Harvard and Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania, who were soon replaced by their schools.</p><p>Throughout most of the 2023-24 school year, pro-Palestinian encampments and tense standoffs played out on many campuses across the country. Last year’s graduation ceremonies were often used as forums for protest, including orchestrated walkouts. Generally, protesters and speakers were not disciplined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But universities, especially elite ones like M.I.T. and its Cambridge neighbor, Harvard, have been under even more pressure since President Trump took office in January. His administration is yanking federal funding for grants and research, launching investigations into diversity programs and trying to cut international enrollment.</p><p>Schools everywhere feel the threat, and hope to avoid the government’s scrutiny. </p><p>Ms. Vemuri’s speech prompted criticism from the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, a key ally of President Trump.</p><p>“Ignorant. Hateful. Morally bankrupt. Where is the shame—or appropriate response from the institution?” <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1928649949727629351?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1928649949727629351%7Ctwgr%5Ed5ef38bd10bae83e38e3602ed90318d185a8411f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Fworld%2Fus%2Fus-speaker-reacts-to-indian-american-megha-vemuris-pro-palestine-speech-have-your-children-avoid-mit%2Farticleshow%2F121539805.cms" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote on X</a>. “Have your children avoid MIT &amp; the Ivy League at all costs.”</p><p>Jack Begg<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Branch writes feature stories for The Times on a wide swath of topics, including sports, climate and politics.
