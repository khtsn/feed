Stein of U.S. District Court, set a sentencing date of June 12 for Ms. Menendez, who faces a lengthy prison term.</p><p>Ms. Menendez was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/05/nyregion/bob-menendez-obstruction-justice.html" title="">indicted in September 2023</a> on bribery charges with her husband, but her trial was delayed for months so that she could be treated for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/nyregion/nadine-menendez-breast-cancer-bribery-trial.html" title="">breast cancer</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The jury of seven women and five men found Ms. Menendez guilty of all 15 counts she faced, including bribery, obstruction of justice and conspiring to make Mr. Menendez an agent of Egypt.</p><p>During the senator’s trial, his lawyers had argued that the evidence was circumstantial and did not show that he had directly accepted bribes in exchange for taking official action. Jurors in Ms. Menendez’s monthlong trial, however, heard testimony that she was handed cash and accepted car and mortgage payments from several New Jersey businessmen who were seeking political favors from her powerful husband.</p><p>Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York told jurors that Ms. Menendez had served as a crucial go-between who willingly shuttled messages and bribes to Mr. Menendez.</p><p>“She was keeping him in the loop every step of the way,” Paul M. Monteleoni, a prosecutor, said in a closing argument.</p><p>“She’s telling him what she’s doing,” he added, “because they’re partners in crime.”</p><p>Barry Coburn, Ms. Menendez’s lawyer, had argued that the government failed to link the gold, cash or car found in the couple’s home to any “official act” taken by Mr. Menendez.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“These things that we’re talking about right here are unproven,” Mr. Coburn said in a closing argument.</p><p>“We’re still in, you know, ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ land,” he added about whether Ms. Menendez would have known that it was improper to be relaying sensitive government information.</p><p>He also cited the hundreds of text messages that were introduced as evidence to suggest it was implausible that there could have existed a secret bribery conspiracy.</p><p>“I mean, these people are talking about what they’re doing in, like, thousands of text messages,” Mr. Coburn said.</p><p>Prosecutors had cited the same flurry of messages throughout the four-week trial as they pointed to what they repeatedly described as an overwhelming volume of evidence showing that bribes had been given in exchange for specific actions, or what is known as a quid pro quo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“You don’t need a quid pro quo in writing,” a prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, said Friday in the government’s final summation. “But you have many.”</p><p>Ms. Menendez and Mr. Menendez, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who was once one of the most influential <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/nyregion/robert-menendez-senate-corruption-legacy.html" title="">Democrats in Washington</a>, married in October 2020 after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/nyregion/nadine-menendez-federal-investigation.html" title="">whirlwind courtship</a>.</p><p>Two years later, when F.B.I. agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/nyregion/robert-menendez-bribery-home-searches.html" title="">searched the couple’s home</a> in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., they seized $486,461 in cash, two one-kilo gold bars, 11 one-ounce gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz convertible.</p><p>After a nine-week trial in Manhattan last year, a jury found Mr. Menendez guilty of accepting bribes in exchange for his efforts to quash criminal investigations on behalf of his allies, steer weapons and aid to Egypt and lock in a lucrative monopoly for a company run by a close friend of Ms. Menendez, Wael Hana.</p><p>Mr. Menendez, 71, was sentenced in January to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/nyregion/bob-menendez-corruption-sentencing.html" title="">11 years in prison</a>. Mr. Hana and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer, were also convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Mr. Menendez, who is appealing the verdict, is expected to start serving his sentence in early June.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The indictment laid out an audacious scheme and a cinematic timeline. Ms. Menendez and the senator began dating in early 2018, just weeks after he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/nyregion/menendez-corruption-trial-new-jersey.html" title="">cleared of taking bribes</a> in an unrelated federal case in New Jersey.</p><p>By February of that year, Ms. Menendez, an unemployed mother of two, and Mr. Hana, a U.S. citizen born in Egypt who was having so much trouble making ends meet that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/nyregion/menendez-egypt-bribe-hana.html" title="">lost his home to foreclosure</a>, had devised a moneymaking plan, trial evidence showed. The two longtime friends began arranging meetings between Ms. Menendez’s new boyfriend and Egyptian intelligence officials hoping for additional foreign aid, among other things.</p><p>“When I feel comfortable and plan the trip to Egypt,” Ms. Menendez wrote in a text message shown to jurors, Mr. Hana would be “more powerful than the president of Egypt.”</p><p>The meetings, in fact, paid off. In spring 2019, Egypt granted Mr. Hana’s startup company, IS EG Halal, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/nyregion/menendez-inquiry-halal-meat-company.html" title="">a monopoly</a> to certify that meat imported for sale to the country’s 90 million Muslims had been prepared according to Islamic law.</p><p>When the U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/report/downloadreportbyfilename?filename=Update%20-%20New%20Halal%20Procedures%20May%20Affect%20Trade%20and%20Increase%20Prices_Cairo_Egypt_5-13-2019.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed concern</a> about the arrangement, Mr. Menendez intervened, calling a top official and ordering him to “stop interfering with my constituent,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/nyregion/robert-menendez-bribery-trial.html" title="">trial testimony</a> showed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>IS EG Halal’s monopoly remained in place, and the company expanded rapidly, making Mr. Hana a rich man. The company was then used to funnel bribes to the senator and Ms. Menendez.</p><p>That was only part of the plot. Jurors also found that Mr. Menendez had tried to disrupt criminal investigations that threatened allies, including Mr. Daibes and Jose Uribe, an unlicensed insurance broker whose business associates were under investigation for fraud.</p><p>One of the first bribes the couple received was a $60,000 Mercedes convertible.</p><p>The Mercedes was given to Ms. Menendez to replace a car that was irreparably damaged when she struck and killed a pedestrian, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/nyregion/nadine-menendez-mercedes-death.html" title="">Richard Koop</a>, 49, in December 2018. Ms. Menendez was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/nyregion/nadine-menendez-accident-report.html" title="">not tested for drugs or alcohol</a> after the fatal crash in Bogota, N.J., and she was not charged with wrongdoing.</p><p>But she frequently complained about not having a car in the weeks after the accident.</p><p>Mr. Uribe, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/nyregion/menendez-bribery-defendant-guilty.html" title="">pleaded guilty</a> and cooperated with prosecutors, testified at both trials that he had stepped in to fill that need. He told jurors that he had given the car to Ms. Menendez to win the senator’s help in scuttling the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/nyregion/gurbir-grewal-robert-menendez-bribery-trial.html" title="">insurance fraud investigation</a>.</p><p>Before the purchase, Mr. Uribe gave Ms. Menendez $15,000 in cash to use as a down payment for the car. Ms. Menendez then deposited money at several banks, according to trial evidence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“She’s driving around New Jersey with a bunch of cash,” Mr. Monteleoni told jurors last week, “going from branch to branch, stopping to deposit cash.”</p><p>The next day, she bought the car and sent her future husband a photograph and a message. “Congratulations mon amour de la vie,” she wrote, “we are the proud owners of a 2019 Mercedes.❤️”</p><p>Mr. Richenthal, in his final statement, reminded jurors that despite the complex, overlapping schemes, the case was at its heart a simple matter of greed.</p><p>“Robert Menendez abused his power,” he said, and Ms. Menendez “helped him do it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Iran Nuclear Talks</strong><strong>: </strong>As the administration grapples with how to stop Iran’s nuclear program, it has so far left a trail of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html">mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Housing Aid:</strong> The White House is considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/housing-aid-hud-federal-budget.html">deep cuts to federal housing programs</a>, including a sweeping overhaul of aid to low-income families, in a reconfiguration that could jeopardize millions of Americans’ access to rental assistance funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standoff Over Transgender Athletes:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-sues-maine-trans-athletes-womens-sports.html">sued Maine</a> over policies that allow some transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports, just days after also threatening to cut off funding to the state’s public schools and lunch programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disinformation Office Shuttered:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio shut down a State Department office that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-rubio-state-department-foreign-disinformation.html">tracks and counters global disinformation</a>, including campaigns by rival powers of the United States and terrorist groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Deals With Law Firms:</strong> To avoid retribution, some of the nation’s biggest law firms agreed to deals with President Trump to provide free legal services for uncontroversial causes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html">Now he wants more from them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Changing Briefing Room: </strong>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/15/us/trump-white-house-briefing-room-new-media.html">the seating chart in the White House press briefing room has been controlled</a> by an independent organization.
