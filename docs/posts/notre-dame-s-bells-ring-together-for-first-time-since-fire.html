A weekend of ceremonies starting Dec. 7 will celebrate the opening after an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/world/europe/notre-dame-reopening-paris-france.html" title="">ambitious</a> and expensive effort to rebuild the 860-year-old structure.</p><p>“It’s not perfect yet, but we will make it perfect,” Alexandre Gougeon, who was in charge of the re-installation of the bells, told Agence France-Presse. “This first test was a success.”</p><p>The eight bells in the northern belfry, a key part of the <a href="https://www.friendsofnotredamedeparis.org/cathedral/artifacts/bells/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cathedral’s collection</a> of 21 bronze bells, had been cleaned before being replaced in the tower. Videos <a href="https://x.com/AFP/status/1854851360447250693" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taken</a> by A.F.P. inside the cathedral show the bells swinging in the cathedral’s newly rebuilt northern belfry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A symbol of France’s modern history will join them — three new bells, including one that was rung during the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-olympics-bell-stade-de-france-after-rugby-sevens-notre-dame" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paris Olympic Games</a>, have also been installed.</p><p>Investigators have still not determined the cause of the fire that ravaged the cathedral in April 2019, though leading theories include an electrical short-circuit and a discarded cigarette. Thousands of Parisians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/europe/notre-dame-fire.html" title="">watched</a> aghast from the banks of the Seine as firefighters battled to contain the flames, which destroyed much of the cathedral’s roof and toppled its spire, but ultimately spared the cathedral’s main structure.</p><p>In the aftermath, President Emmanuel Macron had vowed that the cathedral would be rebuilt within five years, and more than 850 million euros in donations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/world/europe/donate-notre-dame-fire.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">poured</a> in within days.</p><p>Hundreds of people — architects, engineers, masons, metalworkers, carpenters and more — have labored at the construction site to meet the five-year target. The work has included rebuilding the collapsed spire, making a new wooden attic and cleaning more than 450,000 square feet of stone surfaces that had been darkened by soot, dust and lead particles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/08/multimedia/08xp-notredame-2nd-zlvc/08xp-notredame-2nd-zlvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/08/multimedia/08xp-notredame-2nd-zlvc/08xp-notredame-2nd-zlvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/08/multimedia/08xp-notredame-2nd-zlvc/08xp-notredame-2nd-zlvc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Scaffolding obscures the domed roof of Notre Dame Cathedral.
