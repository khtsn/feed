hillside in San Francisco. Rows of broccoli and collards, tomatillos, chiles and herbs, stands of cherry and plum trees — all this bounty is available free to the public.

The initial idea was to increase diversity in the wine industry by using those eight rows of grapes as a laboratory for groups of young people to get their hands in the soil, tend the vines, and learn to prune and trellis, harvest the grapes and make the wine.</p><p>That idea has evolved into an ambitious, idealistic, though still tiny program, dedicated to opening agriculture and wine to people who for so long had felt shut out and discouraged from participation. It is fueled almost entirely by the imagination of Mr. Renfro and his program manager, Rita Manzana, and those who have been drawn to help their cause.</p><p>“Chris is a singular individual with how selfless he is and how he wants to see the collective rise,” said <a href="https://www.jahdemarley.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jahdé Marley</a>, a sommelier and advocate for diversity in beverages. “He’s connected with knowledgeable, caring and giving folks.

Together, they have developed a network of wine industry contacts, including <a href="https://wineserver.ucdavis.edu/people/elisabeth-forrestel#/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elisabeth Forrestel</a>, a professor in the University of California at Davis school of viticulture and enology, who gave the apprentices access to the school’s resources and facilities. They’ve made wine together at Davis, with hybrid grapes and wild species that Dr. Forrestel has been collecting.</p><p>“There’s been a lot of inclusion work in the wine space, but not as much in viticulture,” she said. “His is the only program in viticulture.

Project Two Eighty has welcomed 50 students from historically Black colleges and universities to Alemany Farm, and Mr. Renfro has expanded the focus from wine to growing and making all sorts of fermented beverages.</p><p>“Wine is special because it’s the sexy side of agriculture,” he said. “But I grow everything.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Manzana and Mr. Renfro at Alemany Farm.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carolyn Fong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An amphora for fermenting beverages, made by Ms. Kang, a Project Two Eighty apprentice and a ceramist.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carolyn Fong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Some of the apprentices have begun to achieve toeholds in the industry.

Sabrina Tamayo now works at Les Lunes, a natural wine producer, and has her own label, <a href="https://www.rubyblancawines.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ruby Blanca</a>.</p><p>“Chris really honors how much these apprentices want it,” Mr. Matthiasson said. “He has this vision of every single one of these apprentices, and the sky’s the limit after that.”</p><p>In March, Mr. Renfro and his business partner, Jannea Tschirch, opened a tiny, welcoming wine shop, <a href="https://www.friendofafriendsf.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Friend of a Friend</a>, in the city’s North Beach neighborhood, selling natural wines as well as art, food, clothing and fragrances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“This shop is a safe space for people to come in and be interested,” Mr. Renfro said. “I’m not going to somm-splain anything to anybody.”</p><p>Wine and the shop are useful in achieving his larger goals, building communities and helping people get back to the land. “Wine is a conversation starter,” he said.</p><p>The work for Project Two Eighty is purely voluntary. Mr. Renfro, 41, with two young daughters, must work at several day jobs, at Alimentari Aurora, an Italian deli, and Ruby Wine, a natural wine bar and retail shop, as well as Friend of a Friend.</p><p>During the pandemic, Ruby organized an outdoor presentation in which Mr. Renfro took part, introducing people to natural wine. Mr. Carole, who had been working as a software engineer, attended. He had been interested in fermentations, primarily in baking and miso.</p><p>“Wine had not entered my consciousness as something I could do,” he said in a telephone interview.</p><p>His curiosity piqued by the presentation, he got in touch with Mr. Renfro, who invited him into the apprentice program, which had just started. He learned farming, winemaking and made connections. A few years later, with some experience, he and his family moved to the Loire Valley.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“Two Eighty was instrumental,” Mr. Carole said. “Without the project, I had the motivation, but I didn’t have the community.

One day, a woman walked into Friend of a Friend and Mr. Renfro struck up a conversation. He learned that her mother had an organic vineyard in Lodi, Calif., but had been unable to sell the grapes, including old-vine zinfandel. Apprentices with Two Eighty helped with the harvest, received some grapes and will return to prune the vineyard. This year, they also got some Napa cabernet sauvignon from another grower who was unable to sell the grapes.</p><p>“I’d much rather people call us then tear out their vines,” Ms. Manzana said.</p><p>A few years ago, Mr. Renfro took over stewardship of a remarkable small vineyard at <a href="https://filoli.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Filoli Historic House and Garden</a>, a repository of many rare plants in Woodside, Calif., including 120 varieties of American and hybrid grapes, which he makes into wine.</p><p>What kind of grapes are they? Mr. Renfro shrugged. “I look at them all as wine grapes,” he said.</p><p>As for the state of the wine business, Mr. Renfro blames the industry for its exclusivity and lack of imagination. Fewer than one percent of American wineries are owned by Blacks, <a href="https://wineindustryadvisor.com/2021/07/27/study-black-business-owners-reveals-need-inclusion-equity/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to one study</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“Everybody’s saying, ‘Wine’s not selling, wine is oversaturated,’ ” he said. “But with so few people of color, how can you say that? There’s a lack of correspondence between supply and demand.”</p><p>Mr. Renfro suggested the industry re-examine wine coolers, combinations of wine and fruit juice that were widely popular in the 1980s, but which the fine-wine world dismisses as mass-produced trifles.</p><p>This year, with the apprentices, he produced what he called a natural version of a cooler made of apple, quince, mugwort and other herbs, which they put in 250-milliliter bottles. It was lovely, floral, lively and delicious.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-25"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bottled wines in Mr. Renfro’s garage in San Francisco.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carolyn Fong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Two Eighty apprentices have made different types of fermented beverages.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carolyn Fong for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>“I wanted to make something like what my mom was drinking,” he said, adding that ridiculing such beverages was part of the gatekeeping that has for so long has made people feel shut out of wine. “I would like to make things more approachable. Making this is power.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>He imagined what could happen if a corporate wine company were to produce something like this. I suggested that a natural beverage might not lend itself to mass production.</p><p>“You might have to let this sector of the business tell a different story,” he said. “What if we had a bunch of smaller projects rather than one big one? People like one-off things. What about a bottle of wine dropping like streetwear?”</p><p>Mr. Renfro’s vision is infectious, drawing in people like Matt Niess of <a href="https://northamericanpress.wine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">North American Press</a>, which makes wine and ciders from hybrid and native varieties. Mr. Niess has volunteered his facilities, and his licensing, so that the apprentices would have a place to make wine and legally sell it.</p><p>“To already see the effects of what he’s doing to create a more equitable, diverse and sustainable community is amazing,” Mr. Niess said. “It’s not just morally right, it’s creating a more exciting, creative and economically viable business in the long range.”</p><p>Project Two Eighty has a wealth of plans. But it lacks financing, both for basic items like a van for transporting the apprentices and for its larger dreams, like acquiring a small piece of land in Napa to plant hybrid grapes or creating a three-dimensional scan of vineyards as a teaching tool for the off-season.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>“If we had investors to help us, we could build out Two Eighty rapidly,” Mr. Renfro said. “We’re able to dream about bigger things than people typically think of with wine.
