She was 87.</p><p>Her death was announced on Facebook by her publisher, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DomQuixote" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dom Quixote</a>. The Portuguese prime minister, Luis Montenegro, paid tribute to her on X, calling her “an important example of freedom and the struggle to recognize the place of women.”</p><p>Ms. Horta was the last surviving member of the celebrated writers known as the “Three Marias,” who together wrote the landmark 1972 book “Novas Cartas Portuguesas” (“New Portuguese Letters”). A collection of letters the women wrote to one another about their problems as women in Portugal, it opened up a world of repressed female sexuality, infuriated the country’s ham-fisted dictatorship and led to their arrest and criminal prosecution on charges of indecency and abuse of freedom of the press.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The three writers’ landmark 1972 book, “Novas Cartas Portuguesas” (“New Portuguese Letters”), infuriated Portugal’s ham-fisted dictatorship and led to their arrest and criminal prosecution on charges of indecency and abuse of freedom of the press.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todavia, 2024 edition</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“To feminists around the world, as well as to champions of a free press, the police action against the Portuguese women in June 1972 was an outrage that slowly became the focus of an international protest movement,” Time magazine wrote in July 1973.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Three Marias — Ms. Horta, <a href="https://www.publico.pt/2016/09/03/culturaipsilon/noticia/morreu-maria-isabel-barreno-uma-das-tres-marias-1743111" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Isabel Barreno (1939-2016)</a> and Maria Velho da Costa (1938-2020) — became international feminist folk heroes, and the book’s fame alerted the world to repression under the Portuguese dictatorship. Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras and Adrienne Rich were among the writers who declared their public support. The National Organization for Women voted to make the case its first international feminist cause.</p><p>The case was not Ms. Horta’s first brush with controversy.</p><p>In 1967 she had been “beaten in the street” after the publication of her breakthrough volume of poetry, “Minha Senhora de Mim” (“My Lady of Me”), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYgtFPqfQJE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she told her biographer</a> Patrícia Reis in 2019.

People do not consider the violence that goes on in bed, in the sexual act with their husband.”</p><p>In 1971, these preoccupations inspired Ms. Horta to start meeting every week with two friends and fellow authors, Ms. Barreno and Ms. da Costa, to share written reflections on the common themes that troubled them.</p><p>They were inspired by a classic work from the 17th century, “Letters of a Portuguese Nun,” supposedly written by a young woman shut up in a Portuguese convent to the French cavalry officer who had abandoned her. Scholars now believe the work was fiction, but its powerful expression of pent-up longing and frustration resonated with the three Marias.</p><p>Like the nun in the book, they used letters to one another, as well as poems, to express their unhappiness as women in their early 30s, educated by nuns, married and with children, in a Lisbon stifling under a 35-year dictatorship, rigid Catholicism and ill-judged colonial wars in Africa.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>When they published the writings as “New Portuguese Letters,” they vowed never to reveal to outsiders, much less the police, who had written what.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Three Marias in the 1970s, from left: Maria Isabel Barreno, Ms. Horta and Maria Velho da Costa.

They predicted a difficult reception.</p><p>Prime Minister Marcello Caetano attempted to put the authors in jail, calling them “women who shame the country, who are unpatriotic.”</p><p>On May 25, 1972, the state press censor banned the book. The next day it was sent to the criminal police department in Lisbon. When the authors’ trial opened in 1973, the crowd was so great that the judge ordered the courtroom cleared.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In May 1974, nearly two years after their arrests and two weeks after the Portuguese dictatorship was overthrown, the Three Marias were acquitted.</p><p>Judge Artur Lopes Cardoso, who had been overseeing the case, became a sudden convert, declaring the book “neither pornographic nor immoral.” “On the contrary,” he said, “it is a work of art of high level, following other works of art produced by the same authors.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Horta in an undated photograph. “I was born in a fascist country, a country that stole liberty, a country of cruelty, prisons, torture,” she said in 2018. “And I understood very early on that I couldn’t stand for this.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jorge da Silva Horta</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Maria Teresa de Mascarenhas Horta Barros was born in Lisbon on May 20, 1937, the daughter of Jorge Augusto da Silva Horta, a prominent doctor and a conservative who supported the dictatorship, and Carlota Maria Mascarenhas.
