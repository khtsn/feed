And we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. Shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. I’ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from, and of course, that’s important. But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me, and certainly I think to many of the citizens of Europe, is what exactly it is that you’re defending yourselves for? And I believe deeply that there is no security if you are afraid of the voices, the opinions and the conscience that guide your very own people. Europe faces many challenges. But the crisis this continent faces right now, the crisis, I believe, we all face together, is one of our own making. If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-vfkc/14munich-vance-vfkc-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Vice President JD Vance criticized European governments at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, saying that they are failing to uphold democratic values and suppressing forms of free speech.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Leah Millis/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-02-14T09:44:17-05:00"><span>Feb. 14, 2025</span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Vice President JD Vance urged European leaders on Friday to end the isolation of far-right parties across the continent, an extraordinary embrace of a once-fringe political movement with which the Trump administration shares a common approach on migration, identity and internet speech.</p><p>The address stunned and silenced hundreds of attendees at the Munich Security Conference, a forum where top-level politicians, diplomats and analysts had gathered expecting to hear President Trump’s plans for ending the war in Ukraine and Europe’s defense against a rising Russian threat.</p><p>The vice president singled out his German hosts, telling them to drop their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/germanys-merz.html" title="">objections</a> to working with a party that has often reveled in banned Nazi slogans and has been shunned from government as a result. He did not mention the party, the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, by name, but directly referred to the longstanding agreement by mainstream German politicians to freeze out the group, parts of which have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/20/world/europe/far-right-germany-fear.html" title="">formally classified</a> as extremist by German intelligence.</p><p>“There is no room for firewalls,” Mr. Vance said, bringing some gasps in the hall.</p><p>He punctuated the message by meeting on Friday with Alice Weidel, the AfD’s candidate for chancellor in this month’s election, as well as other German leaders. Altogether, it was an unusual intervention in the domestic politics of a democratic American ally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The vice president offered what may be a preview under Mr. Trump of a redefinition of a trans-Atlantic relationship built on postwar bonds of stability between allied governments. Mr. Vance aggressively challenged the diplomats in the hall in Munich, telling them that their biggest security threat was not from China or Russia, but “the enemy within” — what he called their suppression of abortion protests and other forms of free speech.</p><p>He made the claim at a moment when Russia was waging the largest ground war in Europe since 1945 over Ukraine. It signaled the Trump administration’s priorities — expanding the MAGA movement abroad rather than countering President Vladimir V. Putin’s aggression.</p><p>Mr. Vance’s remarks echoed those of hard-right leaders across Europe and the anti-establishment messages that Russia has pumped onto social media in an effort to destabilize democratic politics in America and Europe.</p><p>Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, called it “a very brilliant speech.”</p><p>“I heard his speech, and he talked about freedom of speech,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVD5J4mbKFo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump said</a>. “And I think it’s true in Europe; it’s losing. They’re losing their wonderful right of freedom of speech. I see it. I mean, I thought he made a very good speech, actually, a very brilliant speech.”</p><p>Mr. Vance is the second figure in the Trump administration to try to chip away at the efforts to isolate the far right ahead of the German elections next Sunday by attempting to destigmatize the AfD.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The billionaire Elon Musk, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, endorsed the AfD late last year in a post on social media. He has publicly interviewed Ms. Weidel. And in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/europe/musk-germany-afd-auschwitz.html" title="">an address to party members this month</a>, Mr. Musk said Germany has “too much focus on past guilt.” That was a clear reference to Hitler’s long shadow, which continues to dominate mainstream German politics, including in tight legal restrictions against Nazi language.</p><p>Mr. Vance’s remarks drew a furious response from German leaders across most party lines. They immediately rejected Mr. Vance’s suggestion that they should drop their firewall against the AfD, pointing to past comments by the party’s members in support of the National Socialists, or Nazis.</p><p>Boris Pistorius, the German defense minister and a member of the governing Social Democrats, deviated from his planned speech on Friday afternoon to rebuke Mr. Vance.</p><p>“If I understood him correctly, he is comparing parts of Europe with authoritarian regimes — this is not acceptable,” Mr. Pistorius said, drawing sustained applause. “This is not the Europe, not the democracy, where I live.”</p><p>Thomas Silberhorn, a member of Germany Parliament for the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats, also said: “This is our business. My message to the U.S. administration is: German extremists who explicitly refer to National Socialism — part of the AfD — are clearly anti the U.S. that liberated us from National Socialism.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The AfD and its members have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/world/europe/germany-afd-nazi-hocke.html" title="">history of use of Nazi language</a> and antisemitic and racist comments, along with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/world/europe/germany-far-right-plot-court.html" title="">plots</a> to overthrow the federal government. The party has surged to second in the polls with its call to crack down on immigration.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of Germany, addressing the Munich Security Conference on Friday." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv/14munich-vance-add1-bqfv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e4bd8356-f3dd-5a8e-a88b-3d6bc751dfb9" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of Germany addressing the Munich Security Conference on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michaela Stache/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Vance did not note that baggage, nor did he mention any extremist elements of anti-immigration political parties.

He tied the migration to terrorist crimes, including a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/germany-car-crash-munich-driver-arrested.html" title="">car attack in Munich on Thursday</a> by an Afghan asylum seeker, which injured 30 people.</p><p>“Over the span of a decade, we saw the horrors wrought by these decisions yesterday in this very city,” he said.</p><p>Even before Mr. Vance spoke, experts at the security conference were warning European leaders that they could be in for a fast and painful reordering of the continent’s relationship with the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s push to negotiate directly with Russia’s president over Ukraine and his transactional approach to trade policy and military spending dominated a breakfast panel discussion hosted by the American Council on Germany and the global accounting firm KPMG.</p><p>One panelist, Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, said that it was possible Mr. Trump would build a new Euro-American alliance between parties that share core values of immigration opposition, unregulated social media speech and “anti-woke” attitudes.</p><p>The council <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/transatlantic-twilight-european-public-opinion-and-the-long-shadow-of-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released new polling this week</a> that suggests that value shift has already resonated in Europe.
