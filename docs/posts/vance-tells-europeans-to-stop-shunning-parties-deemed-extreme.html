And we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. Shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. I’ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from, and of course, that’s important. But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me, and certainly I think to many of the citizens of Europe, is what exactly it is that you’re defending yourselves for? And I believe deeply that there is no security if you are afraid of the voices, the opinions and the conscience that guide your very own people. Europe faces many challenges. But the crisis this continent faces right now, the crisis, I believe, we all face together, is one of our own making. If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14munich-vance-vfkc/14munich-vance-vfkc-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Vice President JD Vance criticized European governments at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, saying that they are failing to uphold democratic values and are exercising extreme censorship.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Leah Millis/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-02-14T11:48:13-05:00"><span>Feb. 14, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>11:48 a.m. ET</span></span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Vice President JD Vance told European leaders on Friday that their biggest security threat was not military aggression from Russia or China, but their own suppression of free speech — including efforts to block hard-right parties from joining governments.</p><p>An audience that was largely expecting Mr. Vance to lay out the Trump administration’s priorities for the trans-Atlantic alliance, NATO military spending and negotiations with Russia over ending the war in Ukraine, instead received a lecture on what Mr. Vance described as the continent’s own failures in living up to democratic ideals.</p><p>Those failures, Mr. Vance said, included efforts to restrict so-called “misinformation” and other content on social media and laws against abortion protests that he said unfairly silenced Christians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Perhaps most strikingly, the vice president called on Europeans to drop their opposition to working with anti-immigration parties, calling them a legitimate expression of the will of voters angered by high levels of migration over the last decade.

He added: “If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.”</p><p>Germany’s political class, including the conservative Christian Democrats who currently lead the polls to form the next government, has largely adopted more restrictive measures on migration in recent years, following the AfD. But they distinguish the AfD itself as extreme, because of some of its members’ history of use of Nazi language and antisemitic and racist comments, along with plots to overthrow the federal government.</p><p>Mr. Vance did not make that distinction, nor did he mention any extremist elements of anti-immigration political parties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>German leaders immediately rejected Mr. Vance’s suggestion, pointing to past AfD member comments in support of the national socialists, the party of the Nazis.</p><p>“This is our business,” said Thomas Silberhorn, a member of parliament for the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats, and a former federal defense official. “My message to the U.S. administration is: German extremists who explicitly refer to national socialism — part of the AfD — are clearly anti the U.S. that liberated us from national socialism.”</p><p>Mr. Vance also barely mentioned Ukraine, even after meeting with its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, earlier in the day. Last year at this conference, Mr. Vance, then a U.S. senator, notably refused to meet with Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>Mr. Vance’s only references to the Ukraine conflict came in passing, disappointing attendees who had hoped to learn more about the administration’s plans for peace negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine arriving at the Munich Security Conference on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thomas Kienzle/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense, the threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor,” Mr. Vance said.</p><p>“What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.”</p><p>Mr. Vance suggested that European efforts to counter election influence campaigns by Russia were instead suppressing legitimate speech, at one point obliquely comparing some of the continent’s current leaders to the former Soviet bloc.</p><p>He poured scorn on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/europe/romania-election-russia.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">decision in “remote Romania,”</a> as he called it, to cancel a presidential election because of clear evidence of Russian manipulation of the political campaign.</p><p>“If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Vance also decried the mass migration into Germany and Europe in 2015, tying it to terrorist crimes, including a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/germany-car-crash-munich-driver-arrested.html" title="">car attack in Munich on Thursday</a> by an Afghan asylum seeker, which injured 30 people.</p><p>“Over the span of a decade, we saw the horrors wrought by these decisions yesterday in this very city,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Tankersley is the Berlin bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-tankersley">More about Jim Tankersley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Steven Erlanger is the chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe and is based in Berlin.
