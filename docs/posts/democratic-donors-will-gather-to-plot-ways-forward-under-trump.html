    <h1>Democratic Donors Will Gather to Plot Ways Forward Under Trump</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“This was a close election, and we lost. But we can’t just move on without identifying what we as a party failed at, addressing solutions and forging ahead,” said Bradley Beychok, the group’s president. “Our job is to analyze a 360-degree view of last November and offer solutions to help address and solve for the challenges that lie ahead.”</p><p>Speakers will include Mitch Landrieu, a former Biden administration official who also served as mayor of New Orleans; Heather Cox Richardson, a historian and popular newsletter writer; Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian; John Della Volpe, a top Democratic pollster; Jennifer Rubin, an opinion columnist at The Washington Post; and John Harwood, a journalist who has worked for CNBC, CNN and The New York Times.</p><p>The American Bridge network was founded by David Brock, a former conservative journalist who has become a leading Democratic fund-raiser and adviser to major donors.</p><p>With the Democratic fund-raising world still in turmoil after Vice President Kamala Harris’s defeat, part of what the party’s big donors have been debating is whether they should try to rejigger their universe to better prepare for the 2026 and 2028 elections.</p></div></div>
