Tens of thousands of people stood shoulder to shoulder in St. Peter’s Square to watch. When the smoke rose, many onlookers cheered; others groaned.</p><p>Our Rome bureau chief, Jason Horowitz, told us that black smoke had been widely expected on the opening day. “The first vote is generally symbolic, testing the strength of candidates,” he said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/07/world/pope-conclave-updates/how-does-the-voting-work?smid=url-share" title="">Here’s how the voting works</a>.</p><p>The past two conclaves reached decisions within two days, but earlier votes have taken much longer. For now, the cardinals will retire to guest quarters at the Vatican — isolated during their deliberations, without phone or internet access and under oaths of total secrecy. They will vote tomorrow morning, and continue to cast ballots until a two-thirds majority agrees on a candidate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Part of a damaged aircraft near Srinagar, in Indian-controlled Kashmir, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tauseef Mustafa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6c45fd1b">India and Pakistan traded blows</h2><p>India’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/asia/india-pakistan-attacks.html" title="">attacks on Pakistan</a>, which came in response to a terrorist massacre last month, killed more than 20 people and injured dozens of others. But evidence has emerged that at least two Indian jets went down during the attack — the sort of embarrassment that India had hoped to avoid after losing a plane to Pakistan in 2019.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The question now is whether Pakistan will decide that it must answer India’s strikes with an attack of its own on Indian soil. For now, Pakistan says it is keeping all options open. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/asia/india-pakistan-conflict.html" title="">But diplomats and analysts expressed some hope</a> that the day’s events might offer the two sides an offramp to avert a spiral into all-out war.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Speaker Mike Johnson.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-7a6ac76a">House speaker ruled out an aggressive plan to cut Medicaid</h2><p>Speaker Mike Johnson, the Republican leader in the House, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/medicaid-cuts-house-republicans-johnson.html" title="">ruled out one of his party’s most aggressive plans</a> to cut Medicaid costs to help pay for President Trump’s agenda.

The researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/science/covid-coronavirus-bats-genetics.html" title="">argued that both viruses followed similar trajectories</a>, jumping from bats to wild mammals in China, and eventually to humans, likely through the wildlife trade.</p><p>The findings add to the debate around the origins of Covid. The White House argues that the virus leaked out of a lab in Wuhan, China; the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. agree, but with low certainty; Chinese officials suggest the virus came from a lab in the U.S. Scientists remain without enough evidence to prove any argument.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-1e960f12">The year’s best books, so far</h2><p>We’re more than a third of the way through 2025, and our Book Review team has already written about hundreds of books.

They fill the air with a briny smell as they snake through the historic lagoon city like roadways for gondolas full of tourists. This week, at the Venice Biennale of Architecture, those famous yet murky waterways <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/style/coffee-venice-water.html" title="">will be used as a source for a $1.36 cup of espresso</a>.</p><p>A cafe will pull water straight from the canals in clear tubes and filter it in two ways in front of customers: with a “microwetland” of salt-tolerant plants, or with reverse osmosis and ultraviolet disinfection. A Michelin-starred chef is charged with perfecting the flavor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Have a robust evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
