And spend it they have.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Harris spent $166 million during that 16-day period, almost equal to what she spent in the entire month of August; $130 million of that was spent on media.</p><p>Alongside her allied committees, she raised $182.6 million in early October, according to a New York Times analysis of campaign-finance reports. She and President Biden together have raised $1.8 billion with the party.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his allied committees raised about half Ms. Harris’s total, $92.1 million, during the 16-day window. He crossed the $1 billion threshold in the amount he has raised with the party since announcing his run for president in November 2022, according to The Times’s analysis.</p><p>The money flowed out rapidly, though. Mr. Trump’s principal committee spent $100 million in the 16-day period, more than he spent in June, July and August combined. He spent $88 million of that on advertising.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>He entered the second half of October with $36.2 million on hand. Ms. Harris had three times that — $119 million — leaving her in a much better financial position for the final three weeks of the election.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald Trump at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Democrats have built a bigger organization in their parties, too. The Republican National Committee, as of Oct. 16, had $48 million on hand. It transferred $23.8 million to state parties in battlegrounds and paid salaries to about 355 people during that period. The Democratic National Committee had about $30 million on hand after transferring $44 million to state parties and paying about 740 people.</p><h2 id="link-77a4ca6e">The biggest Democratic group’s biggest donor? Unknown.</h2><p>The largest Democratic super PAC, Future Forward, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/elections/future-forward-kamala-harris-ads.html" title="">prioritizes late ad purchases</a>, and much of the money it has raised came late in the cycle. Just on Wednesday, for instance, the group disclosed a mammoth $82 million ad purchase.</p><p>The group raised $89 million in the first half of October, or almost $6 million a day. Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, chipped in $25 million during the period, on top of his prior $13 million, making him the largest disclosed donor to the group in the cycle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But the largest actual donor remains a mystery. During early October, $40 million of the $89 million raised came from the super PAC’s allied dark-money group, whose donors remain secret, continuing a trend of secrecy that has defined the group’s rise.</p><h2 id="link-36361436">Elon Musk’s Trump budget: $119 million</h2><p>Over just 16 days, Elon Musk spent $57 million to support Republicans.</p><p>Mr. Musk, the world’s richest person, put an additional $43.6 million into his super PAC, America PAC, between Oct. 1 and Oct. 16, increasing his total pro-Trump spending to a staggering $119 million. Mr. Musk is now the second biggest pro-Trump donor, climbing above Miriam Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, but below Timothy Mellon, heir to the Mellon banking fortune.</p><p>Mr. Musk also disclosed a $10 million check to the Senate Leadership Fund, the main super PAC for Senate Republicans, which is led by allies of Senator Mitch McConnell. That donation was Mr. Musk’s largest by far in his career, outside of the checks he cut to his own super PAC this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk awarded Kristine Fishell with a $1 million check during a town hall in Pittsburgh, Pa., on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Musk gave $825,000 to a super PAC in support of a political ally, Representative Tony Gonzales of Texas. Mr. Musk also contributed $2,339,600 to the Sentinel Action Fund super PAC, which, like Mr. Musk’s organization, is doing voter canvassing in Pennsylvania. The leader of that group, Jessica Anderson, <a href="https://x.com/JessAnderson2/status/1849616416602804693" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> on social media that Mr. Musk’s donation was the precise amount to close the group’s funding gap in Pennsylvania. “Thank you @elonmusk for catching the early vote/ absentee vision!”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Other donors cutting checks in early October to pro-Trump super PACs included Dick and Liz Uihlein, leaders of the ULine shipping supply company ($9.5 million); Jan Koum, a WhatsApp co-founder ($5 million); Diane Hendricks, a roofing magnate ($5 million); Ron Cameron, a poultry company C.E.O. ($2 million); the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen ($2 million); and Safra Catz, the Oracle C.E.O. ($1 million).</p><p>Mr. Andreesen, who runs a prominent Silicon Valley firm with Ben Horowitz, famously <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/04/ben-horowitz-endorse-kamala-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">split</a> earlier this fall on the presidential race. Mr. Andreesen made his donation to support Mr. Trump’s group on the same day, Oct. 7, that Mr. Horowitz donated $2.5 million to a pro-Harris super PAC.</p><p>Albert Sun<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering campaign finance and the influence of billionaires in American politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/theodore-schleifer">More about Theodore Schleifer</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-election-commission">Federal Election Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/miriam-adelson">Miriam Adelson</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
