The deal could also include funding from Microsoft.</p><p>OpenAI launched the A.I. boom in late 2022 with the release of the online chatbot ChatGPT, spurring a surge in funding for A.I. companies. But enthusiasm among investors has cooled in recent months, as several high-profile start-ups have essentially been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/technology/ai-start-ups-google-microsoft-amazon.html" title="">folded into tech giants like Google and Amazon</a>.</p><p>Still, OpenAI remains a leader in the race to artificial intelligence. It is among a handful of companies with a blend of experienced researchers and large amounts of money that can work with resource-intensive A.I. systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since it released ChatGPT, OpenAI has built increasingly powerful technologies, including versions of its chatbot that can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/technology/chatgpt-dalle3-images-openai.html" title="">generate images</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/technology/openai-chatgpt-app.html" title="">humanlike speech</a>.</p><p>In early 2023, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI, bringing its total investment in the company to $13 billion. A year later, Thrive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/technology/openai-artificial-intelligence-deal-valuation.html" title="">led</a> a deal that valued the company at more than $80 billion. With that deal, OpenAI did not issue new shares. It allowed the company’s employees to sell their existing shares.</p><p>The new investment, which was reported earlier by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/openai-nears-funding-round-at-more-than-100-billion-valuation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg News</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-in-talks-for-funding-round-valuing-it-above-100-billion-4f0550c5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>, would allow other existing shareholders to sell their shares.</p><p>OpenAI declined to comment.</p><p>(The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)</p><p>The new investment talks follow a year of rapid growth and turmoil for the San Francisco start-up.
