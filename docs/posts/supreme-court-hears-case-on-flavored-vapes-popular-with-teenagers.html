The manufacturers’ applications, the law says, must demonstrate that their products are “appropriate for the protection of the public health.”</p><p>The agency has denied many applications under the law, including the two at issue in Monday’s case, saying the flavored liquids presented a “known and substantial risk to youth.”</p><p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="https://casetext.com/case/wages-white-lion-invs-v-food-drug-admin-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled in January</a> that the agency changed the rules in the middle of the application process, accusing it of “regulatory switcheroos” that sent the companies “on a wild-goose chase.” More formally, the court said the agency’s actions had been arbitrary and capricious.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1038/303408/20240319144123357_FDA%20v.%20Wages%20%20White%20Lion.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asking the Supreme Court</a> to hear the case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-1038.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Food and Drug Administration v. Wages and White Lion Investments</a>, No. 23-1038, the agency’s lawyers cited <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/21-2077/21-2077-2022-12-12.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another appeals court</a> that had reached the opposite conclusion. The Fifth Circuit’s decision “has far-reaching consequences for public health and threatens to undermine the Tobacco Control Act’s central objective of ‘ensuring that another generation of Americans does not become addicted to nicotine and tobacco products,’” they wrote, quoting from the other appeals court’s decision.</p><p>The Fifth Circuit’s decision is an outlier, Curtis E. Gannon, a lawyer for the agency told the justices on Monday. He added that “common sense tells us that a flavor like Mother’s Milk and Cookies is going to be disproportionately attractive to children.”</p><p>Eric N. Heyer, a lawyer for the manufacturers, said the agency had engaged in a bait-and-switch by saying that certain kinds of scientific studies were not required and then rejecting the applications for failing to provide them. “F.D.A. never communicated that there was going to be an end-all-and-be-all litmus test as to whether there was this comparative efficacy evidence,” he said.</p><p>But several justices said the 2009 law itself required a showing that the benefits of the products outweighed their costs. “The statute makes it the litmus test,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. “You’re trying to change the statute, but the statute is very clear: Tell us that your product is going to help adults stop smoking cigarettes and show us that youth is not going to start.”</p><p>There was little question, Justice Elena Kagan said, that the agency had determined that the flavored liquids at issue were aimed at minors. “Everybody basically knows that flavors are particularly dangerous in terms of kids starting the use of smoking products,” she said, adding, “Blueberry vapes are very appealing to 16-year-olds and not to 40-year-olds.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Heyer disagreed. “A lot of adults use blueberry flavor and other nontobacco flavors,” he said. “Often the quitting journey is to move away from tobacco or menthol flavors because they don’t want to be reminded of the combustible cigarettes.”</p><p>Mr. Gannon said the products were aimed at persuading minors to take up an unhealthy habit. Mr. Heyer countered that vaping was safer than smoking and that many adults had been made better off by switching.</p><p>Mr. Heyer added that the fate of the case was unclear given President-elect Donald J. Trump’s <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113171256073757122" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vow to “save vaping.”</a></p><p>“We don’t know,” Mr. Heyer said, “exactly what that’s going to look like.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
