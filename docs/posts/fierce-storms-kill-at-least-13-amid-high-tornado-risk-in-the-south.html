The state experienced extensive storm damage, the agency said.</p><p>The National Weather Service on Saturday issued the highest risk alert for tornadoes in some parts of the South.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The most dangerous threat of tornadoes would most likely be across Louisiana and Mississippi from late morning into early afternoon on Saturday. From the afternoon into the evening, the storms are expected to sweep across Alabama and maybe into Tennessee before crossing into Georgia and northern Florida overnight.</p><p>According to the Storm Prediction Center, Saturday is likely to be the third time in history that the center has issued a high-risk warning on the second day of a storm.</p><p>Central Mississippi and Alabama face the highest risk level, five, in the center’s rating system. The Gulf Coast states and Georgia face a high risk level of four on Saturday.</p><p>Storms at this highest level of alert can often produce intense long-track tornadoes, meaning they stay on the ground for a very long time. A slow storm will typically only affect one or two communities, but a faster-moving storm such as this one can cross multiple states, leaving a long trail of damage.</p><p>The National Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/NWStornado/status/1900932642566000971" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> a tornado watch for eastern Louisiana, including Baton Rouge, and nearly all of Mississippi through Saturday evening. The service said these areas faced a “particularly dangerous situation,” a rare designation used during a high risk of violent tornadoes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency warned of excessive rainfall and flash flooding in the Southeast “with numerous significant tornadoes expected on Saturday afternoon and evening.”</p><p>The Storm Prediction Center received 23 reports of tornadoes since Friday across Arkansas, Illinois, Mississippi and Missouri, according to FEMA, as well as nearly a dozen reports of hurricane-force winds.</p><p>In Missouri, tornado damage was reported in Bridgeton, Morse Mill, Perryville and Poplar Bluff, according to FEMA. And in Arkansas, tornado damage was reported in Black Rock, Campbell, Cave City and Smithville, FEMA said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="14wea-severe-sat" data-id="100000010053495" data-source-id="100000010053495"><div slug="14wea-severe-sat" data-sourceid="100000010053495" id="embed-id-100000010053495">
