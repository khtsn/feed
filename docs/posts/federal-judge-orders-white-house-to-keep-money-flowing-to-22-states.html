McConnell Jr., is a temporary but significant victory for the Democratic attorneys general from those states and the District of Columbia, who sued the administration in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The order applies only to the states that filed the lawsuit.</p><p>It requires the administration not to “pause, freeze, impede, block, cancel, or terminate” taxpayer money already allocated by Congress.</p><p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.58912/gov.uscourts.rid.58912.50.0_4.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The 13-page orde</a>r, for which Judge McConnell did not specify an expiration date, adds an obstacle to Mr. Trump’s plans to aggressively reshape the government around his own agenda; a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued an earlier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/states-lawsuit-trump-federal-grants-pause.html" title="">administrative stay</a> on Tuesday blocking the initial order from the White House Office of Management and Budget to freeze as much as $3 trillion in federal money while the review for ideological compliance continued. That stay was set to expire on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Trump administration has sent conflicting signals about the freeze, rescinding the memo that ordered it but signaling that the review of the ideological tilt of previously funded federal programs would continue.</p><p>“This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Wednesday, in a social-media post that was introduced as evidence in the lawsuit. She added that the president’s executive orders “on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
