As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/world/europe/pope-leo-cardinal-prevost-obstacles.html" title="">Pope Leo XIV was introduced to the world</a>, the owner learned that the new pontiff, who grew up as Robert Francis Prevost, spent at least some of his childhood in the brick Cape Cod-style house on 141st Place, about 30 minutes south of downtown Chicago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert Francis Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV (left), as a child with his older brothers Louis and John Joseph.

He had fielded only a handful of offers in recent months. Mr. Budzik and the owner, Paweł Radzik, 36, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/realestate/pope-leo-xiv-home-chicago-sale.html" title="">quickly pulled the house off the market</a> as the two figured out what to do next.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Budzik said it felt impossible to set a price for the home now that they knew its unique history. So they turned to Paramount Realty, a real estate auction firm that had held an auction in 2017 for another unassuming house: a five-bedroom Tudor in Queens where Donald Trump lived until age 4. It sold for $2.14 million, more than double the average of comparable houses in the area.</p><p>Paramount <a href="https://www.prusa.com/auctions/pope-leo-xivs-childhood-home-chicago-dolton-il/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has begun collecting bids</a> for the property in Dolton on behalf of Mr. Radzik, who purchased the home a year ago with a plan to renovate and flip it. The online bidding will conclude on June 18.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-5"><div><figcaption><span>The home was bought a year ago by a house flipper who is now set to make a windfall.

You’re not selling real estate, you’re selling much more than that,” Mr. Budzik said. Offering the property at auction, he said, would allow prospective buyers from around the world to make a bid on a piece of papal history, including nontraditional buyers who might seek to turn the home into a museum or a landmark.</p><p>“This is the best chance for selling it for top dollar and also getting the most amount of exposure,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Misha Haghani, the chief executive and founder of Paramount, said a famous former resident can bring in big bucks. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/nyregion/donald-trump-childhood-home-auction.html" title="">auction of Mr. Trump’s childhood home</a> was held just days before his first inauguration. Though the house later fell into disrepair and sold earlier this year for just $835,000, it still made history at the 2017 auction. Mr. Haghani referred to the $2.14 million sale as the “Trump bump.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>He’s now known as Pope Leo XIV, but as a boy, he was known as Robert Prevost.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eloisa Lopez/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Property records show that Mr. Radzik, a professional home rehabber, bought the house in Dolton for $66,000. The interest in its history is sure to drive up the price, Mr. Haghani said, anticipating that the house could sell for seven figures.</p><p>“We can call this the pope premium,” he said. “Within one week this is going to be the most famous home on the planet. What the highest and best bid will be, or who it will be from, is anyone’s guess.”</p><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- --> and <!-- -->Stefanos Chen<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Pope Leo XIV</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>AI is Top Priority: </strong>The pope’s focus on artificial intelligence shows he is a church leader who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/europe/pope-leo-artificial-intelligence.html">grasps the gravity of this modern issue</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Call for Peace: </strong>In his first audience with the press as pontiff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/europe/pope-leo-vatican-journalists.html">Leo renewed his pleas for a more peaceful world</a> and quoted his predecessor, Pope Francis, who had called for communication that is free from aggression.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Pope’s Brother, MAGA Disciple: </strong>Now-deleted Facebook posts from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/louis-prevost-pope-leo-xiv-brother.html">Louis Prevost</a> suggest an embrace of some of the most common complaints and conspiracies of the right.</p></li><li><p><strong> The</strong><strong> Health Benefits of Being Pope</strong>: Such a demanding job can be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/well/pope-health-leo.html">good for the brain and body</a>, but Leo may still have to contend with challenges that are common in old age.</p></li><li><p><strong> The Religious Order That Molded the Pope: </strong>The Order of St. Augustine, with fewer than 3,000 members, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/europe/pope-leo-order-of-st-augustine.html">shaped the man</a> who would become a cardinal, and then pope to the world’s Roman Catholics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeing the First American Pope as Hardly American:</strong> Catholics around the world were skeptical at first about an American pope.
