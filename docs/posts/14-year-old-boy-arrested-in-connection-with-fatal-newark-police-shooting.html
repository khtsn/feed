Stephens II, the Essex County prosecutor, said during a news conference on Saturday. The boy’s name has not been released by the authorities.</p><p>The officer who was killed was identified on Saturday as Joseph Azcona, 26, a detective who had served with the Newark Police Department for five years. Detective Azcona died just after 2:30 a.m. on Saturday at University Hospital, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“These are officers who got up yesterday morning to do their job, to go outside and make sure our streets were safe,” Mayor Ras J. Baraka of Newark said at the news conference. He added that gun violence, especially among teenagers, was an urgent issue in the New Jersey city. “We just have to do a better job. I have to do a better job,” he said. “This is not a police problem. This is our collective problem.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Detective Joseph Azcona and another police officer were shot Friday night in the North Ward of Newark. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andres Kudacki for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The shooting that killed Detective Azcona broke out at 6:30 p.m. on Friday near the corner of Broadway and Carteret Street, a busy intersection in the North Ward of Newark.</p><p>According to Mr. Stephens, Detective Azcona and another Newark police officer had gone to the area to investigate a group of people who they believed were carrying illegal guns. The two officers approached the group in a police car and were met with gunfire. Detective Azcona was struck while still inside the vehicle, Mr. Stephens said, and the other officer appeared to have been struck outside the car.</p><p>Both officers were taken to the hospital, where Detective Azcona died hours later. The other officer, who was not identified on Saturday, was recovering from non-life-threatening injuries at the hospital that morning, Mr. Stephens said.</p><p>The Newark police have arrested five people in connection with the shooting, including the 14-year-old boy, who was also being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We need to focus laser sharp on trying to find the reason why this 14-year-old was in the situation that he was,” Mr. Stephens said during the conference. “He had a gun, and felt he could use it against the police. That’s a crazy situation. That’s one that cannot go unchecked.”</p><p>Emanuel Miranda, Newark’s public safety director, praised Detective Azcona, calling the intelligence unit he worked for the “best of the best.”</p><p>“Our heart is heavy right now,” Mr. Miranda said. “Our agency is hurting. We lost a true hero last night. His mother, his father and his brothers were at the hospital mourning him, grieving him. Our community is mourning.”</p><p>Matthew J. Platkin, New Jersey’s attorney general, expressed his condolences for Detective Azcona and his support for the other officer in a <a href="https://x.com/NewJerseyOAG/status/1898433718760378877" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement on social media</a>, lauding their work in the force. “I remain in awe of their sacrifice and commitment to protecting us all,” he wrote.</p><p>The shooting sent shock waves through the typically quiet North Ward, a working-class and largely Latino area of New Jersey’s largest city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Stuff like this normally doesn’t happen here,” said Johnny Williams, 32, who moved to the neighborhood seven years ago. “You’ve got to be cautious with your children. With everything that’s going on in this world, we don’t need this now.”</p><p>Detective Azcona’s mother, Nereida Vargas, said in a brief interview on Saturday that she and her family were struggling with the tragic news. Ms. Vargas had rushed to the hospital after learning of her son’s injuries, she said, and was at his side when he died on Saturday morning.</p><p>She described her son, the youngest of her four children, as a warm person whose loss was deeply felt in their community.</p><p>“He has a lot of friends and a lot of family who loved him,” she said.</p><p>Jack Begg<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maia Coleman writes about breaking news and the criminal justice system in New York City and its surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maia-coleman">More about Maia Coleman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
