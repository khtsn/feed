But I don’t believe it’s a bygone era.”</p><p>Mr. Biden, too, has been dismissed as a man of a bygone era, an old-school politician in a new-school world, an octogenarian president playing by rules he learned in the 1970s when he served in the Senate and Mr. Carter was in the White House, rules that did not help him in today’s fast-paced, smash-mouth political arena. He is, in this view, a man out of time — Mr. Carter’s time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>As he said, Mr. Biden does not accept that and believes that “the fundamental human values” his generation brought to the table still apply. Yet when he spoke of Mr. Carter’s “honesty and character,” he left no doubt that he meant that in contrast to his predecessor and soon-to-be successor, Donald J. Trump, the first former president ever convicted of felony crimes and found liable for sexual abuse and business fraud.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“In today’s world, some look at Jimmy Carter and see a man of a bygone era — with honesty and character, faith and humility,” Mr. Biden said on Sunday after the former president’s death. “It mattered. But I don’t believe it’s a bygone era.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That Mr. Carter would depart the scene at this particular stage of Mr. Biden’s presidency, however, evokes a certain sense of déjà vu: another one-term Democratic president whose aspirations for another term were damaged by inflation and struggles to win the release of hostages held in the Middle East before he leaves office.</p><p>And once again, the players in the region who could effectuate the release of the hostages may be watching the clock in Washington and waiting for the departing president’s time to run out, delaying any deal until the next president takes the oath, just as happened on the day in 1981 that Mr. Carter turned over the reins to Ronald Reagan.</p><p>“The parallels are uncanny,” Richard Moe, who served as chief of staff to Mr. Carter’s vice president, Walter F. Mondale, said on Monday. “And I believe there is something to it.”</p><p>Mr. Biden and Mr. Carter, of course, are different in many respects, too, and the circumstances of their departures from the White House vary in important ways, not least that Mr. Carter was just 56 when he left office while Mr. Biden, at 82, is departing trailed by doubts about his capacity to have served another four years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But they had a long history together. “I’ve been hanging out with Jimmy Carter for over 50 years,” Mr. Biden noted on Sunday night.</p><p>Mr. Biden was the first Democratic senator to endorse Mr. Carter’s long-shot 1976 bid for the presidency and, 45 years later, he became the first sitting president to honor Mr. Carter by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/business/economy/biden-georgia-carter.html" title="">visiting him at his home in Plains, Ga.</a>, in 2021. They both saw themselves as straight shooters in a world of spinners, and both of them made their mark early on as more moderate Democrats only to shift to the left over the course of their lives.</p><p>“They had a real affinity for each other,” said Gerald Rafshoon, who was Mr. Carter’s White House communications director.</p><p>Still, the nostalgia of today has a way of obscuring the messier reality of the past. As much as Mr. Biden came to admire Mr. Carter, there were tensions between them back in the day. In his 2007 memoir, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/books/25arts2-BIDENBOOKISA_BRF.html" title="">Promises to Keep</a>,” Mr. Biden recalled coming to rue his support for Mr. Carter.</p><p>“Jimmy Carter was a man of decency and a man of principle, but it wasn’t enough,” he wrote. Recalling a flap between Mr. Carter and European allies, Mr. Biden wrote, “That’s the first time I realized that on-the-job training for a president can be a dangerous thing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In many ways, Mr. Carter and Mr. Biden were a study in contrasts. Still, it was clear that Mr. Biden had learned some lessons from Mr. Carter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Indeed, in a largely forgotten episode, Mr. Biden even contemplated challenging Mr. Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1980. “I campaigned hard for Carter in two elections, but I thought he had a dangerous penchant for moralizing,” he wrote. “‘You thump that Bible one more time,’ I told him once, ‘and you’re going to lose me, too.’”</p><p>After Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts kicked off a Democratic primary campaign against Mr. Carter, Mr. Biden recalled, a group of political consultants urged him to join the race, too. “They said I could be the compromise candidate,” he recounted. But he was just 37 at the time and opted against it.</p><p>In many ways, Mr. Biden and Mr. Carter were a study in contrasts. Unlike Mr. Carter, a quintessential outsider from Georgia who never served in political office in Washington until becoming president, Mr. Biden has been a creature of the capital for more than half a century.</p><p>Mr. Carter disdained the art of negotiating with Congress, while Mr. Biden relished it and pushed through some of the most sweeping domestic legislation since the 1960s affecting climate change, health care, manufacturing and infrastructure. Yet while Mr. Carter’s mental capacity for the presidency was never in question, Mr. Biden’s age and shaky public performances ultimately sank his prospects for re-election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still, it was clear that Mr. Biden had learned some lessons from Mr. Carter.</p><p>On the hostages, for instance, Mr. Carter elevated the importance of his standoff with Iran, where 52 Americans were held captive for 444 days — so much so that he refused to hit the campaign trail for re-election at first and made the crisis the all-consuming priority of his administration.</p><p>Mr. Biden, by contrast, has labored to secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, but only a few of them are American and he has not let it dominate his presidency.</p><p>Even so, former Carter aides like Stuart E. Eizenstat recognize the echoes of history. Mr. Eizenstat, who served as White House domestic policy adviser and later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/books/review/president-carter-stuart-eizenstat.html" title="">wrote a well-regarded account</a> of the Carter presidency, said three factors doomed Mr. Carter in 1980, what he called “the three I’s”: intraparty warfare, inflation and the Iran hostage crisis.</p><p>There are parallels, he said, with Mr. Biden. For starters, Mr. Eizenstat said, “they both faced the fact that they were dealing with divided Democratic parties.”</p><p>While Mr. Carter fended off Mr. Kennedy to secure the nomination in 1980, he was damaged heading into the general election against Mr. Reagan. Mr. Biden faced no primary challenge this year, but “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/politics/biden-drops-out.html" title="">he was driven out in effect by his own party</a>” after his faltering debate performance in June against Mr. Trump, as Mr. Eizenstat put it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rosalynn Carter with Mr. Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, after Mr. Biden became the first sitting president to honor Mr. Carter by visiting him at his home in Plains, Ga., in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>While both presidents presided over robust job growth, inflation was a singular albatross. It was far worse in Mr. Carter’s day, <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-inflation#:~:text=Inflation%20began%20ratcheting%20upward%20in,latter%20half%20of%20the%201980s." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">topping 14 percent</a> in the election year of 1980, compared with 2.7 percent in November 2024. “We would have died to have 3 percent inflation,” Mr. Eizenstat said.</p><p>But it had spiked to 9 percent earlier on Mr. Biden’s watch, shocking Americans with little or no memory of the Carter and early Reagan eras. The lingering effects eroded Mr. Biden’s support since the price of groceries has not fallen even though the rate of increase has dropped back down to normal levels.</p><p>And then there was Iran. While the hostage crisis that stretched on from November 1979 until after the 1980 election was far more debilitating politically for Mr. Carter, the broader chaos of today’s war in the Middle East and the tumult it has fomented in the United States similarly chipped away at the perception of Mr. Biden’s leadership.</p><p>“It was that same sense of presidential impotence — not because they were; they did everything humanly possible,” Mr. Eizenstat said of the Biden team. “But he was dealing with combatants who did not see a bridge of compromise between them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The hopeful news for Mr. Biden comes from the other lesson that Mr. Carter’s experience offers. While Mr. Carter was once seen as a failed president, his reputation among both historians and everyday Americans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/politics/jimmy-carter-legacy-presidency.html" title="">has improved dramatically</a> since, with, 57 percent of Americans now approving of how he did in office, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/508625/retrospective-approval-jfk-rises-trump.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a Gallup poll last year</a>.</p><p>The more daunting news for Mr. Biden is that it took Mr. Carter more than four decades to get to that point. Leaving office in middle age, Mr. Carter had another lifetime to rebuild public respect, a process enhanced by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/politics/jimmy-carter-post-presidency.html" title="">his extensive humanitarian work and freelance diplomacy</a>, which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. Mr. Biden, at this stage the oldest man to have occupied the office, by definition has a shorter window to burnish his legacy.</p><p>“His long post-presidency gave him the opportunity to do that, which Joe unfortunately will not have,” Mr. Eizenstat said of his former boss. “But having said that, I genuinely believe history will be much kinder to Biden, as it is to Carter, because he accomplished so much.”</p><p>So in that sense, when Mr. Biden says, as he did on Sunday night, that “we’d all do well to try and be a little more like Jimmy Carter,” his admirers hope that applies to the current president as well.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
