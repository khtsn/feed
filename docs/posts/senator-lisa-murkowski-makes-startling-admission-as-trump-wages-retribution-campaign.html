After pausing for about five seconds, she acknowledged: “It’s quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. I’ll tell you, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that’s not right.”</p><p>Ms. Murkowski’s comments were first reported by The <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2025/04/14/we-are-all-afraid-speaking-to-alaska-nonprofit-leaders-murkowski-gets-candid-on-upheaval-in-federal-government/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anchorage Daily News</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/69FGNdBemTI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Ms. Murkowski, an independent voice in an increasingly tribal party, has been the rare Republican on Capitol Hill willing to criticize the Trump administration. After Mr. Trump in February berated President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the Oval Office, she warned that the United States was “walking away from our allies.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>She has routinely criticized the Department of Government Efficiency for creating a “tremendous amount of unnecessary anxiety” and for firing federal workers in her state. And Ms. Murkowski was one of only three Republicans who voted not to confirm Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.</p><p>Ms. Murkowski has become more outspoken in Mr. Trump’s second term, but she has long been part of a small minority in her party willing to stand up to its leader at a time when most G.O.P. lawmakers have chosen to fall in line. She was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/us/politics/republicans-vote-to-impeach.html" title="">one of seven Republicans who voted in 2021 to convict Mr. Trump</a> in his second impeachment trial, and the only one up for re-election at the time. She was also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/us/politics/for-murkowski-the-decision-to-support-jackson-came-amid-a-fraught-political-campaign.html" title="">one of three Republicans who voted to support</a> Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Ms. Murkowski has been upfront about her discomfort in a party led by Mr. Trump, whom she said she refused to vote for last year; Ms. Murkowski endorsed former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina for president. At the time, Ms. Murkowski even considered leaving the party altogether, although she has not done so.</p><p>“I just regret that our party is seemingly becoming a party of Donald Trump,” she told CNN last year. When asked if she would leave it and become an independent, she said that she was “navigating my way through some very interesting political times. Let’s just leave it at that.”</p><p>On Monday in Anchorage, Ms. Murkowski said she did not plan to stop speaking out, even if she was frightened of retaliation. “That’s what you’ve asked me to do,” she said, referring to her constituents. “I’m going to use my voice to the best of my ability.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She added: “I have to figure out how I can do my best to help the many who are so anxious and are so afraid.”</p><p>Ms. Murkowski, a fourth-term senator, is up for re-election in 2028.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.
