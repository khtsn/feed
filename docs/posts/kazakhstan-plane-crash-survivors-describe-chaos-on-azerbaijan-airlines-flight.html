Then, while one flight attendant was standing in the cabin, something hit his arm, cutting it. The passengers, sensing something was terribly wrong, began panicking. Some began praying.</p><p>One passenger recalled thinking it would be the last prayer of his life. Then, silence.</p><p>The anxious and chaotic scene on board Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243 was described by two flight attendants — Zulfugar Asadov and Aydan Rahimli — and a passenger, Subhonkul Rakhimov, in interviews with The New York Times on Friday and with an Azerbaijani TV station.</p><p>They were among the 29 survivors from the plane that set off on Wednesday with 67 people on board from Baku, Azerbaijan, en route to Grozny, and that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/world/europe/kazakhstan-plane-crash-russia.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">crashed in a ball of black smoke and orange flames</a> on the shores of the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan.

The aircraft, an Embraer 190, had already made three attempts to land in the city, in Russia’s Chechnya republic, according to Mr. Asadov. And then it began acting weirdly.</p><p>Data received from the plane showed that its vertical speed oscillated more than 100 times during the final 74 minutes of flight, according to Flightradar24.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>After he heard the peculiar sound outside the plane’s fuselage and his arm was cut — by what he does not know — Mr. Asadov said he took a towel and bandaged it tightly.</p><p>Ms. Rahimli, the other flight attendant who survived, helped Mr. Asadov treat his arm, he said. She told <a href="https://www.xezerxeber.az/news/veb-tv/431251/qezada-sag-qalan-teyyare-beledcisi-xezer-xebere-muhum-aciqlama-verib" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Xezer Xeber Azerbaijani television network</a> that she had heard two bangs outside the airplane and that fragments had penetrated the cabin.</p><p>On Friday, Azerbaijan Airlines said the preliminary results of the Azerbaijani investigation showed that the plane had suffered “physical and technical external interference.”</p><p>While American intelligence agencies do not have definitive information yet, U.S. officials have said there are preliminary indications that the plane was shot down by a Russian antiaircraft system, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/asia/investigators-plane-crash-kazakhstan.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">mostly likely a surface-to-air missile</a>.</p><p>Shocked by the impact on the plane, some passengers stood up in panic, the witnesses said.</p><p>Mr. Rakhimov, the passenger, said in a Reuters interview from a hospital in Baku that he, too, had heard a bang. After he saw the plane’s fuselage was damaged, he said, he expected the aircraft to collapse. He began to pray.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I thought that was my last prayer,” Mr. Rakhimov said. </p><p>Miraculously, the plane continued flying.</p><p>Ms. Rahimli and Mr. Asadov were sitting in the back, they said, talking to other flight attendants over the phone. Then, the plane crashed.</p><p>Mr. Rakhimov, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/world/asia/kazakhstan-plane-crash.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">describing the impact</a>, said he was hit and his body twisted over and over again. Suddenly, there was silence, he said, until people around him began to moan, presumably in pain from their injuries.</p><p>“I realized that we have landed,” he said. “I didn’t know what to do — whether to laugh or cry.”</p><p>On Friday, Azerbaijan Airlines <a href="https://t.me/AzerbaijanAirlines/2037" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it had suspended regular flights to eight Russian cities. It also stopped flights to Makhachkala in neighboring Dagestan.</p><p>Investigators from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia have opened criminal inquiries into the cause of the crash. In Azerbaijan, investigators have said they believe that a Russian Pantsir-S1 air-defense system damaged the plane, according to two people in Baku who were briefed on the inquiry and spoke anonymously because the investigation was ongoing.</p><p>In a statement, Rosaviatsia, the Russian aviation agency, said it had offered full cooperation into the investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Asadov’s daughter Konul said in a phone interview that she had learned of the tragedy when her husband called her and told her to come home from work.</p><p>“He told me, ‘Don’t worry, your father is alive, but the plane he was on crashed,’” she said. Her mother was already aware of what had happened, and at Mr. Asadov’s home, his son and neighbors had already gathered.</p><p>She said she started watching videos of the crash on the internet and couldn’t believe that anyone could have survive the crash. She said was able to talk to her father only the day after the disaster.</p><p>“When I heard his voice,” she said, “I thought I was being deceived, that he couldn’t have survived something like that, that someone was faking his voice to comfort me.”</p><p>When she and her family arrived at the hospital, relatives of Ms. Rahimli, the other flight attendant who had survived and given her father first aid on the plane, were also there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>She said she and her family never got used to her father’s job. “I call him every time before the flight if the weather is bad, and after the flight I call my mom and ask if she talked to him,” she said.</p><p>On the day the plane crashed, she said, she did not call her father because the weather was good in Baku, and she did not think about the fact that the climate could be bad where he was flying.</p><p>After the crash, Mr. Rakhimov said he was lucky: He had been sitting in the back of the plane. The aircraft’s front end had received most of the impact, but the tail end had been sheared off, videos and images from the crash show.</p><p>As for Ms. Rahimli, she said in the TV interview: “I opened my eyes and saw workers. I asked where I was, and they said that we were in Aktau,” the city in Kazakhstan.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
