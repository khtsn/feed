Disaster relief aid. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/us/pandemic-aid-recovery-schools.html" title="">Education</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/us/transit-covid-spending.html" title="">transportation</a> funding. Loans to <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance/economic-injury-disaster-loans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">small businesses</a>.</p><p>But the two-page memo from Matthew J. Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, left the scope of the pause, and much else, unclear.</p><p>Among the uncertainties was whether President Trump has the authority to unilaterally halt funds allocated by Congress. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said in a statement that the memo “blatantly disobeys the law.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Congress approved these investments and they are not optional, they are the law,” <a href="https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1884082667446231535" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Schumer said</a>, adding that “Donald Trump must direct his administration to reverse course immediately and the taxpayers’ money should be distributed to the people.”</p><p>In his memo, Mr. Vaeth directed federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all federal financial assistance,” and any other programs that included “D.E.I., woke gender ideology and the Green New Deal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-3"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/27/us/omb-memo.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/9b486eeea56f137c/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Vaeth signaled that the pause, which is set to go into effect on Tuesday, would continue until at least mid-February, saying that agencies should provide a detailed report on the programs that have been affected by Feb. 10. He added that the pause was needed to ensure federal programs aligned with Mr. Trump’s policy priorities.</p><p>“The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism and Green New Deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,” Mr. Vaeth said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It was not immediately clear what programs would fall under those categories. The Green New Deal, for example, was a policy proposal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/climate/kamala-harris-green-new-deal.html" title="">that never became law</a>.</p><p>The memo, which was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3lgr2gf5uzk27" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier</a> by the journalist Marisa Kabas, specifies that programs that support nongovernmental organizations would also be affected. Nonprofit groups reacted with alarm.</p><p>“This order is a potential five-alarm fire for nonprofit organizations and the people and communities they serve,” Diane Yentel, the chief executive of the National Council of Nonprofits, said in a statement.</p><p>“From pausing research on cures for childhood cancer to halting food assistance, safety from domestic violence and closing suicide hotlines, the impact of even a short pause in funding could be devastating and cost lives,” she added. “This order could decimate thousands of organizations and leave neighbors without the services they need.”</p><p>The memo cited “more than $3 trillion” in federal financial assistance that could be affected by the directive, but the source of that number was unclear, and another figure the memo cited for total federal spending was significantly inflated. Government analysts estimated the budget for fiscal year 2024 at <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60843/html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$6.75 trillion</a>, while Mr. Vaeth’s memo asserted the government spent “nearly $10 trillion” in that fiscal year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The budget office memo carved out an exception for “assistance received directly by individuals,” as well as Medicare and Social Security benefits. The memo also seemingly acknowledged the legal limits of executive power to interfere in legally mandated programs, saying that agencies should carry out the pause “to the extent permissible under applicable law.”</p><p>It was also unclear what fell under the definition of individual assistance, and the memo did not provide examples of what programs would or would not qualify. Many farmers and small-business owners take out loans and receive grants from the federal government, but it is unclear if those would count as individual assistance or assistance to a business.</p><p>Congress, for example, established a program decades ago that provides farm loans for women, racial minorities and Native Americans — a program that <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/sda_loans-fact_sheet-aug_2019.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the first Trump administration had participated in</a>. That program could theoretically be put under scrutiny for its perceived similarities to “woke,” “D.E.I.” or “Marxist equity.”</p><p>Karl Scholz, the president of the University of Oregon, said Monday’s directive was “generating plenty of questions.” But he, like many others in academia and government, was still trying to interpret the memo and its consequences, saying researchers were experiencing “considerable unease along with a deep interest in getting greater visibility about what is actually happening.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Glenn Thrush<!-- -->, <!-- -->Maggie Haberman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Amy Schoenfeld Walker<!-- -->, <!-- -->David A. Fahrenthold<!-- --> and <!-- -->Alan Blinder<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Upending the Federal Bureaucracy:</strong> President Trump’s rapid push to overhaul government agencies in his first days in office has been met with a mix of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/trump-federal-workers.html">fear, fury and confusion throughout the work force</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Icy Exchange Over Greenland:</strong> Trump told Denmark’s leader he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/europe/trump-greenland-denmark.html">wanted to take over Greenland</a>, European officials say.
