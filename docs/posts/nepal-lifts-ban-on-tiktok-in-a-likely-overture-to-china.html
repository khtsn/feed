Sharma Oli, on Thursday overturned a ban on TikTok that his predecessor imposed in November, an apparent sign that the veteran politician intended to strengthen the country’s relations with China, its northern neighbor.</p><p>The popular social media app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, was banned for its refusal to curb what the previous Nepalese government had described as hate speech that disturbed “social harmony.” At the time, Nepali officials said that they had resorted to the ban after TikTok declined to address concerns about troubling content.</p><p>TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The decision to reinstate TikTok signaled Mr. Oli’s belief that, amid the geopolitical bickering between China and India, Nepal’s neighbor to the south that also banned the app, the Himalayan country was better off aligning with China.</p><p>TikTok and many other Chinese apps have been banned in India since 2020, amid historically fraught relations between the two countries and more recent efforts to dominate the South Asian region.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Prithvi Subba Gurung, a Nepalese government spokesman, said TikTok would now have to abide by certain directives, such as naming a point of contact in the country.</p><p>“We have set a few conditions such as TikTok to be used for promoting Nepali tourism, supporting us for digital safety, digital literacy and digital education and curb hate content,” Mr. Gurung said.</p><p>On Thursday morning, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, Chen Song, wrote on the social media platform X, “<a href="https://x.com/PRCAmbNepal/status/1826431572511244445" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Today is a good day</a>,” which many Nepalese took to mean that the talks to reinstate TikTok had been finalized.</p><p>Mr. Oli, 73, who leads Nepal’s largest communist party, returned to power in July as the leader of a new ruling coalition, taking charge of the government for the fourth time. The previous leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/26/world/asia/nepal-election-prime-minister.html" title="">Pushpa Kamal Dahal</a>, was seen as easier than Mr. Oli for India to manipulate and frequently changing coalition partners for his personal benefit.</p><p>Mr. Oli has made no secret of his opposition to India’s influence in Nepal. During his first stint as prime minister in 2015, he stood up against a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/world/asia/nepal-rations-fuel-as-political-crisis-with-india-worsens.html" title="">crippling economic blockade</a> that India had imposed over certain provisions in Nepal’s Constitution.</p></div></div><div><div><p>During his second stint as prime minister, after elections in 2017, Mr. Oli revised Nepal’s political map in a way that further soured relations with India.</p><p>On Thursday, Nepal and China also agreed to expand a few development projects aimed at strengthening bilateral ties, including an agreement to complete the upgrade of a highway in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative project. </p><p>Anupreeta Das<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
