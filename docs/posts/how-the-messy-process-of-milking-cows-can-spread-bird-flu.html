Since March, the virus has infected <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 700 herds</a> in 15 states. It has also infected at least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">58 people</a>, nearly all of them farm workers. In recent months, cases in cows and humans have mounted especially rapidly in California, now the epicenter of the outbreak.</p><p>Initially, experts worried that the virus might be spreading through tiny, airborne droplets that cows exhaled.</p><p>But data strongly suggests that the virus, known as H5N1, has spread primarily through milk. It replicates quickly in the udders of infected cows, which produce milk with sky-high levels of the pathogen. Droplets of milk can splash into dairy workers’ faces, while milk-splattered equipment and vehicles can transport the virus from cow to cow.</p><p>Although pasteurization effectively inactivates the virus, the pathogen was recently detected in retail samples of raw milk in California.</p><p>Those findings, plus the rising number of human cases, have made experts nervous about the growing public health threat — and the potential ascension of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Kennedy is a vocal proponent and self-professed consumer of raw milk and has said that he wants federal researchers to take a “break” from studying infectious disease.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In theory, a virus that spreads through milk should be easier to control than one that floats invisibly in the air. But a look inside the modern dairy industry reveals that milk-based transmission is profoundly worrying. “Milk is hugely problematic,” said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University.</p><p>The United States has more than 9 million dairy cows, which produce <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=110046" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some 600 million pounds</a> of milk per day. Over the last few decades, consolidation <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=98900" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has transformed</a> the industry; the number of dairy farms has plummeted, but their size has ballooned. In 1997, fewer than 18 percent of the nation’s dairy cows lived on farms with 1,000 or more animals; by 2022, 65 percent of them did.</p><p>These vast, messy milking operations are designed to extract as much milk as possible from each cow two or three times a day. A virus that gets into the milk of a single cow can quickly find its way to many others — or into the dairy industry’s largely immigrant work force.</p><p>As the risks compound, here’s a look at how milking gets done on one big dairy farm. The farm has not had any known cases of bird flu, but the process reveals why a pathogen that spreads through milk is so hard to stop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-4"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Tim Gruber for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-01-vhcq/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-01-vhcq-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-01-vhcq/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-01-vhcq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Tim Gruber for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-03-vhcq/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-03-vhcq-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-03-vhcq/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-03-vhcq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Tim Gruber for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-02-vhcq/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-02-vhcq-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-02-vhcq/00SCI-DAIRY-trip1-02-vhcq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>A beloved cow; Jay Heeg at Heeg Brothers Dairy; Heeg children photos alongside farm accolades.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An aerial of the Heeg Brother Dairy farm: A milk truck parked on a wide, dirt parking area, behind it a long, low cattle barn with an aluminum roof." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="100vw" uri="nyt://image/b420692e-4b49-5c55-b87d-7d5606bec113" decoding="async" width="600" height="449"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The farm is home to 1,730 cows and has both analog and robotic milking parlors.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-333e81ee">The parallel parlor</h2><p>Heeg Brothers Dairy, in Colby, Wis., is home to about 1,730 cows, said Jay Heeg, a third-generation dairy farmer.
