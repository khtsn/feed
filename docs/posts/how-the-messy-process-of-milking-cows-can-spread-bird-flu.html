    <h1>How the Messy Process of Milking Cows Can Spread Bird Flu</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>After bird flu hit the nation’s dairy farms, it spread with alarming speed. Since March, the virus has infected <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 700 herds</a> in 15 states. It has also infected at least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">58 people</a>, nearly all of them farm workers. In recent months, cases in cows and humans have mounted especially rapidly in California, now the epicenter of the outbreak.</p><p>Initially, experts worried that the virus might be spreading through tiny, airborne droplets that cows exhaled.</p><p>But data strongly suggests that the virus, known as H5N1, has spread primarily through milk. It replicates quickly in the udders of infected cows, which produce milk with sky-high levels of the pathogen. Droplets of milk can splash into dairy workers’ faces, while milk-splattered equipment and vehicles can transport the virus from cow to cow.</p><p>Although pasteurization effectively inactivates the virus, the pathogen was recently detected in retail samples of raw milk in California.</p><p>Those findings, plus the rising number of human cases, have made experts nervous about the growing public health threat — and the potential ascension of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Kennedy is a vocal proponent and self-professed consumer of raw milk and has said that he wants federal researchers to take a “break” from studying infectious disease.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In theory, a virus that spreads through milk should be easier to control than one that floats invisibly in the air. But a look inside the modern dairy industry reveals that milk-based transmission is profoundly worrying. “Milk is hugely problematic,” said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University.</p><p>The United States has more than 9 million dairy cows, which produce <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=110046" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some 600 million pounds</a> of milk per day. Over the last few decades, consolidation <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=98900" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has transformed</a> the industry; the number of dairy farms has plummeted, but their size has ballooned. In 1997, fewer than 18 percent of the nation’s dairy cows lived on farms with 1,000 or more animals; by 2022, 65 percent of them did.</p><p>These vast, messy milking operations are designed to extract as much milk as possible from each cow two or three times a day. A virus that gets into the milk of a single cow can quickly find its way to many others — or into the dairy industry’s largely immigrant work force.</p><p>As the risks compound, here’s a look at how milking gets done on one big dairy farm. The farm has not had any known cases of bird flu, but the process reveals why a pathogen that spreads through milk is so hard to stop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-4"><div><figcaption><span>A beloved cow; Jay Heeg at Heeg Brothers Dairy; Heeg children photos alongside farm accolades.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An aerial of the Heeg Brother Dairy farm: A milk truck parked on a wide, dirt parking area, behind it a long, low cattle barn with an aluminum roof." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq/00SCI-DAIRY-ext-lwjq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="100vw" uri="nyt://image/b420692e-4b49-5c55-b87d-7d5606bec113" decoding="async" width="600" height="449"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The farm is home to 1,730 cows and has both analog and robotic milking parlors.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-333e81ee">The parallel parlor</h2><p>Heeg Brothers Dairy, in Colby, Wis., is home to about 1,730 cows, said Jay Heeg, a third-generation dairy farmer.

On a farm with infected cows, dairy workers, who are usually positioned several feet lower than the animals, may be infected if virus-laden milk enters their eyes. The virus could also spread — to human workers or other cows — through tiny, airborne droplets of milk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/autossell/00SCI-DAIRY-suctioncups/00SCI-DAIRY-06-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/autossell/00SCI-DAIRY-suctioncups/00SCI-DAIRY-06-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/02/126704_1_00SCI-DAIRY-06_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Attaching the milk claws.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The claws are not cleaned between cows, and lingering milk droplets may remain in the teat cups when they are attached to the animals next in line. If there is any virus in the milk, it could remain infectious inside the rubber liner for several hours, Dr. Lakdawala and her colleagues found.</p><p>That means that when the milking machine is attached to the next cow in line, the virus could travel into that cow’s teats. “During milking, the teat end is open, potentially even relaxed,”<strong> </strong>said Dr. John Barlow, a veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Vermont.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It takes seven hours for the farm to milk all 1,050 cows.

These include robotic parlors, where the cows have been trained to approach automated milking machines on their own. The technology has been slow to take off in the United States, but it is increasingly popular.</p><p>Last December, Heeg Brothers Dairy opened its own robotic milking barn, which is home to about 450 cows and eight robots. To reach their feed, the cows pass through an automated “sort gate,” which scans a radio frequency identification, or RFID, tag implanted in each animal’s ear. If a cow has recently been milked, the gate opens into the feeding area. But if she’s due for milking, the gate diverts the cow into what is known as the commitment pen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-18"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/autossell/00SCI-DAIRY-arm/00SCI-DAIRY-arm-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/autossell/00SCI-DAIRY-arm/00SCI-DAIRY-arm-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/02/126720_1_00SCI-DAIRY-arm_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The barn has two of these pens, each outfitted with four robotic milking stations.
