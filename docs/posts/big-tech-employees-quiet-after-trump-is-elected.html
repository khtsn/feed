Trump’s first term in the White House, America’s tech giants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/business/trump-travel-ban-apple-google-facebook.html" title="">loudly protested</a> his temporary ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, posted that his great-grandparents were immigrants and that his in-laws were refugees. Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google who immigrated from the Soviet Union as a child, rushed to San Francisco International Airport to protest.</p><p>Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, joined a crowd of employees rallying at the company’s corporate headquarters.</p><p>“Wow, thank you everyone for showing up today,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0tPn6NaiqE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> to cheers. “It’s remarkable.”</p><p>But after this week’s presidential election, the largely liberal work forces of tech’s biggest companies were quiet. While the definitive nature of the election most likely played a role, the change also represented an effort by executives to dampen employee activism in recent years. They put in place policies restricting dialogue, monitored internal chat channels and vowed not to weigh in on the issues that fired up activist employees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If the presidential election was going to be the biggest test of these new rules, the vigilance wasn’t necessary. Reactions to the election on company message boards and forums was muted.</p><p>On a companywide Google forum, someone posted an American flag with the note “Sending support to American colleagues,” which was liked by more than 1,000 employees.</p><p>“My heart is heavy,” one Amazon employee wrote in an internal chat. “I may not know you, but know that I love you.”</p><p>The heads of most of the country’s leading tech employers didn’t acknowledge the election results to their staffs, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/technology/trump-tech-ceos.html" title="">many of them posted their congratulations</a> to Mr. Trump on X, praising his “decisive” and “hard-fought” victory.</p><p>&#34;Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump on his decisive victory,” Mr. Pichai <a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1854207788290850888" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “We are in a golden age of American innovation and are committed to working with his administration to help bring the benefits to everyone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Amazon, Meta and Google declined to comment.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amazon and other tech employees walked out during the Global Climate Strike in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karen Ducey/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s victory landed in an industry deeply changed since his last term. Tech companies had long espoused the idea of bringing your whole self to work, and they were built on a culture of blunt expression. But the turmoil of the past several years — from the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 to the war in Gaza — have turned executives off from the freewheeling cultures they once fostered.</p><p>And as they have focused their companies on efficiency coming out of the pandemic, they have also taken a more assertive approach to their own workers, enacting in some cases the largest layoffs in their histories and demanding that people return to working in an office — or show themselves the door.</p><p>Google since 2019 has instructed employees to keep politics out of the workplace, and the company cracked down on its irreverent Memegen forum, its corporate town square, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/technology/google-memegen-gaza-war.html" title="">this year after workers feuded about the war in Gaza</a>.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Pichai reminded his 181,000 employees to not discuss politics in the workplace regardless of who won the election, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Whomever the voters entrust, let’s remember the role we play at work, through the products we build and as a business: to be a trusted source of information to people of every background and belief,” Mr. Pichai wrote. The company is “at its best” when focusing on its mission and products, he added.</p><p>Employees largely had conversations in smaller groups and more private forums. A few looked for ways to express their discontent without drawing the attention of the company’s internal content moderators. The moderators were removing political posts and temporarily suspending uploading privileges for employees who repeatedly broke the rules, said three people with knowledge of the moderation, who were not authorized to publicly discuss it. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/05/google-curbs-politics-discussion-among-employees-on-us-election-day.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNBC earlier reported</a> on the takedowns and Mr. Pichai’s email.</p><p>Moderators also took down vague posts without captions that were assumed to be about the election, one of the people said, including a number of posts featuring black squares, a symbol of mourning.</p><p>Meta’s human resources department, with support from Mr. Zuckerberg, introduced a policy in late 2022 called “community engagement expectations,” according to a copy of the memo reviewed by The Times. It expressly forbade employees to discuss in the workplace hot-button political issues, including abortion, racial justice movements, wars and political news.</p><p>Amazon’s senior leaders pulled back this year on issuing frequent statements on political or cultural issues, according to three people familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Tuesday, several Amazon executives spoke about the future in a two-hour companywide meeting and did not mention the election once. Andy Jassy, the company’s chief executive, defended the company’s office mandate against claims it was a “backdoor layoff,” expressed hope in the company’ A.I. innovations and praised experiments to deliver eggs faster to customers.</p><p>But the real test of tech’s newfound neutrality will be once Mr. Trump takes office, if he follows through on his promises on issues the companies have opposed.</p><p>“Remember the famous travel ban?” he <a href="https://time.com/7022828/trump-travel-ban-refugees-gaza/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at a September rally. He vowed to bring it back.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karen Weise writes about technology and is based in Seattle.
