    <h1>EDG and Bilibili earn top seeds, playoff byes in Stage 1</h1>

		<p>The final week of the group stage in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2359/champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1" target="_blank">VCT China 2025 Stage 1</a> sorted all teams into their playoff seeding, with EDward Gaming and Bilibili Gaming securing the top spots and byes past the first round. The VCT China Stage 1 playoff bracket is official, with the top three teams booking their tickets to Masters Toronto.</p>

<p>Here is the rundown for how the fifth week went in VCT China 2025 Stage 1:</p>



<p>There were four three-map series in this final week of the group stage in Stage 1, but the last two series ending up as sweeps did significantly affect the Group Alpha standings. Nova Esports was in a prime position to get the top spot in Group Alpha, as they needed to win and for EDG to lose. Instead, Nova was swept by TEC, and despite EDG facing some internal drama, EDG swept FPX to jump the group standings and earn the top seed in their group.</p>

<p>With the results this week, FunPlus Phoenix were the odd ones out and were eliminated from both the Stage 1 playoff stage and Masters Toronto. By extension, Dragon Ranger Gaming was the final team to qualify for the playoffs, even though the team lost in 2-1 fashion to the already eliminated TYLOO squad.</p>

<p>Last week&#39;s results already sorted out all the playoff teams in Group Omega, but now the seeding is fully decided. At first, the results looked like XLG could steal the top seed when they ended the stage 4-1, but Bilibili secured it due to their win over the Ascension winners earlier in week one. XLG ended in the second seed for Group Omega, followed by Wolves in third and Trace in fourth.</p>

<p>As for the best individual performance of the week, there were a lot of candidates. <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/22047/rarga">
		Rarga	</a>
</span> from XLG kept up his form from previous weeks to nearly get his team to the top seed, while <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span> had a great series to secure EDG a bye in the playoffs. However, the true star in week five was <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7841/tvirusluke">
		TvirusLuke	</a>
</span> from TEC. This roster has been improving every week, and the former DRG player had a Raze masterclass to sweep Nova and move to the second seed.</p>

<p><em>TvirusLuke gets a triple kill with a Bucky and an ultimate against Nova.</em></p>

<p>In a two-map series, TvirusLuke had 39 kills, 274 ACS, and an absurd 43% headshot rate. He performed well in both maps but was key on Fracture to turn what could&#39;ve been a close map into a confident win for TEC.</p>



<p>With the seeding for both groups sorted, here is a full breakdown of the playoff bracket for VCT China 2025 Stage 1. </p>

<p>The top three teams from this tournament will all qualify for Masters Toronto, so the top seeds will only need to win one series to qualify, while every other team needs to win at least two to get to Toronto.</p>
