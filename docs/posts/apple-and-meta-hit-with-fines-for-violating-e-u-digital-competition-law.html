The European law aims to keep big tech companies from abusing their position as digital gatekeepers that can unilaterally impose requirements on users and businesses.</p><p>Apple violated the Digital Markets Act by restricting how app developers could communicate with customers about sales and other offers, according to the European Commission, the executive branch of the 27-nation bloc. Meta broke the law by imposing a “consent or pay” system that forces users to either allow their personal data to be used to target advertisements, or pay a subscription fee for advertising-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Even as the United States and European Union tussle over trade, tariffs and the war in Ukraine, the penalties showed a consensus on both sides of the Atlantic over addressing the power of the world’s largest tech companies. The tech behemoths have amassed trillions of dollars in stock market value as owners of products and services that are essential for communication, commerce, information and other areas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the United States, Google suffered two major antitrust defeats over the past year for abusing its power in internet search and digital advertising. Meta is on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/technology/meta-ftc-trial-whatsapp-instagram.html" title="">trial in Washington</a> over accusations that it squashed competition through acquisitions. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/ftc-amazon.html" title="">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/technology/apple-doj-lawsuit-antitrust.html" title="">Apple</a> also face U.S. antitrust lawsuits.</p><p>It is unclear how the Trump administration will react to the European Union rulings against Apple and Meta. In February, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-issues-directive-to-prevent-the-unfair-exploitation-of-american-innovation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a memo</a> saying it would consider retaliation if the European Union targeted American tech companies under the Digital Markets Act or the Digital Services Act, a law focused on curbing illicit online content and disinformation.</p><p>Meta said it was likely to appeal the ruling, calling it an attack on American companies akin to imposing steep tariffs on their services.</p><p>“The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,” Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, said in a statement. “This isn’t just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service.”</p><p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The investigations of Apple and Meta started <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1689" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than a year ago</a>, predating the Trump administration’s trade and tariff fight with Europe. But regulating the tech industry has become entangled in the trans-Atlantic negotiations, with American tech firms seen as a possible target after the Trump administration’s efforts to tax European exports to the United States. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The fines announced against Apple and Meta on Wednesday were lower than the maximum allowed under the law, which could have totaled billions. </p><p>In the Apple case, regulators said the company failed to comply with rules meant to allow developers offering games, productivity tools and other software through the App Store to communicate with customers about offers.</p><p>“Consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers,” the regulators said on Wednesday.</p><p>Regulators on Wednesday also issued another preliminary ruling against Apple for violating the Digital Market Act by restricting access to rivals’ app stores on iPhones and other Apple devices. The commission closed a separate Apple investigation after the company gave customers more options to delete certain apps that came preinstalled on devices.</p><p>For Meta, European regulators said the company violated the law by introducing an ad-free subscription service that amounted to forcing users to pay for privacy. The Digital Markets Act requires companies to obtain users’ permission before combining their personal data from different services. Those who do not provide consent are meant to have access to a “less personalized but equivalent alternative,” the commission said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Apple and Meta have 60 days to comply with the ruling or they can face additional fines.</p><p>“Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the D.M.A. by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,” Teresa Ribera, the executive vice president of the European Commission, who is overseeing application of the law. “All companies operating in the E.U. must follow our laws and respect.”</p><p>Threats by the Trump administration to retaliate against Europe hang over several tech investigations. Google faces possible penalties over business practices related to its Google Play app store and search engine that may have run afoul of the Digital Markets Act.</p><p>And in another major investigation, X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/technology/eu-penalties-x-elon-musk.html" title="">expected to be penalized</a> over violations of the Digital Services Act.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Satariano is a technology correspondent for The Times, based in London.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
