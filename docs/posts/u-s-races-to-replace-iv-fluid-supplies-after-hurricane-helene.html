The plant makes about 60 percent of the United States’ supply of fluids used in IVs, for in-home dialysis and for people who rely on IV nutrition. They include premature babies in intensive care and patients who rely on tube feeding to survive.</p><p>The situation could become even more dire now that Hurricane Milton is bearing down on Florida. On Tuesday, workers at B. Braun, makers of a fourth of the nation’s IV fluids, loaded trucks at the company’s plant in Daytona Beach with the medical bags and drove them north through the night to what they hoped would be a safer location.</p><p>The Baxter plant, in Marion, N.C., and the B. Braun site in Daytona Beach manufacture about 85 percent of the nation’s supply of IV fluids. Experts on shortages have long pointed out the risk of <a href="https://qualitymatters.usp.org/geographic-concentration-pharmaceutical-manufacturing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">such over-concentration</a> of critical supplies, citing exposure to disasters like those now at hand. Even before the latest storm, supplies were tight and reflected a longstanding problem of how few companies are willing to produce crucial but low-cost and low-profit supplies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A spokeswoman for the B. Braun site in Florida said that the company was working with federal officials and that the plant’s staff would be off work Wednesday and planned to return on Friday once the hurricane had moved on.</p><p>The supply crunch from flooding at the Baxter plant has led the company to limit hospital customers to 40 to 60 percent of their typical supplies this week. The American Hospital Association <a href="https://www.aha.org/2024-10-07-aha-president-urging-administration-take-immediate-action-address-iv-solution-supply-shortage-result-helene" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote to President Biden</a> on Monday, seeking assistance to alleviate concerns about “substantial shortages of these lifesaving and life-supporting products.”</p><p>The saline, dextrose and sterile water fluids that the Baxter plant makes have myriad uses in health care: They are used for basic hydration before surgery or childbirth and can be mixed with nutrients and medications, including chemotherapies. They are widely used in life-supporting infusions for babies born prematurely. Some are crucial to treating sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection.</p><p>“When you’re coming in with sepsis, and specifically the septic shock, those one-liter bags are the most immediate form of treatments, and sometimes you’re getting two, if not three, of them in rapid succession,” said Dr. Chris DiRienzo, chief physician executive of the American Hospital Association. “There are so many special populations impacted by the shortage, what it really leads to is an impact on the whole population.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The saline, dextrose and sterile water fluids that the Baxter plant makes have myriad uses in health care, from basic hydration before surgery to life-supporting infusions for babies born prematurely or for treating sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jae C. Hong/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Patients who rely on Baxter’s fluid to do at-home dialysis treatments and those who depend on IV nutrition for survival have been particularly distressed by the shortage, doctors and patients said in interviews.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Federal officials and some Baxter staff members have worked nights and weekends to try to lessen the effects of the disruption in supply. The Food and Drug Administration was said to be on the verge of approving the temporary importation of IV, dialysis and liquid nutrition products from several foreign sites.</p><p>In North Carolina, crews are working to rebuild a bridge adjacent to the Baxter site to remove and distribute truckloads of additional supplies that were not damaged in the storm.</p><p>Baxter said in a statement on Wednesday that its foreign plants were ramping up production and anticipating F.D.A. authorization to export their goods. Given the expected deliveries, the company said <a href="https://www.baxter.com/baxter-newsroom/hurricane-helene-updates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it would</a> <a href="https://www.baxter.com/baxter-newsroom/hurricane-helene-updates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increase</a> its releases of supplies on Wednesday to 60 percent of normal levels from the 40 percent provided earlier this week. </p><p>“We will spare no resource — human or financial — to restart operations and help ensure patients and providers have the products they need,” José Almeida, the chief executive at Baxter, said in a statement Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For patients like Hannah Hale, 37, who lives in the Dallas area, help cannot come too soon. Ms. Hale found out on Monday that her specialized pharmacy could not obtain enough of the highly concentrated dextrose solution to continue giving her the IV fluid she relies on.</p><p>Ms. Hale has been sustained by I.V. fluids for eight years, she said, after undergoing extensive surgeries for Crohn’s disease, a condition in which the immune system attacks the digestive tract.</p><p>“They’re not supposed to just drop me like that,” she said, adding that calls to 14 other pharmacies did not turn up a backup source. “I don’t have any recourse.”</p><p>Texas Health, a large health system in North Texas, said that it could not comment on patient-specific cases, but that it had “proactively implemented IV fluid conservation measures” because of the storm-related shortages.</p><p>After The New York Times sent questions to Ms. Hale’s health care provider, the provider reached out to tell her it could help her and compound some shelf-stable nutrition she had on hand in saline, a stopgap measure. She said her last bags of her standard IV nutrition would last only until Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the Chicago area, Northwestern Medicine doctors and nurses have been working to shore up supply of dialysis fluids for about 90 patients who perform the procedure in their homes. Those patients use specialized liquids to help clean their blood when their kidneys are not up to the task. Dr. Vikram Aggarwal, medical director of the home dialysis program, said no new patients could be added right now.</p><p>“We are triaging; we are trying to risk-stratify,” he said. “Another one to two weeks with this shortage, it could be a matter of concern.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Crews were working to rebuild a bridge adjacent to the Baxter site earlier this month to remove and distribute truckloads of additional supplies that were not damaged in the storm.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aerial Lens</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>If federal officials’ plans fall into place, concerns could abate. Top officials at the Health and Human Services Department and the F.D.A. have had a lot of experience dealing with medical supply shortages in recent years. Deep gaps in adequate supplies were evident during the Covid pandemic, when nurses wore garbage bags as protective gear and automotive companies manufactured ventilators.</p><p>In 2023, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/health/cancer-drugs-shortage.html" title="">shortage of cheap chemotherapy drugs</a> choked off supplies in the late spring and early summer, setting off a worldwide chase for back stock and new suppliers. Just over a year ago, a tornado splintered parts of the roof of a Pfizer plant in North Carolina, leading to yet another round of shortages of generic drugs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The high-stakes shuffling of critical supplies has become a new routine as increasingly powerful and unpredictable storms upend taut medical supply chains. The current IV shortage has reminded many hospital staff workers of a similar outage after Hurricane Maria in 2017, when a Baxter plant in Puerto Rico stopped making IV fluids.</p><p>The current fluid shortage aligns with the factors experts list as amplifying risks of disruptions to patients: The products are cheap, giving few suppliers incentive to make competing products. Given sterility requirements, the barriers to enter the field are high. And with 60 percent of supplies coming from one U.S. site, the concentration of products adds another risk factor.</p><p>Whether lawmakers and other officials will learn from the series of crises remains unclear, said Tom Cotter, executive director of Healthcare Ready, a nonprofit founded after Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>“We haven’t seen a really big uptick in investment in resiliency from the government to harden our supply chains,” Mr. Cotter said.</p><p>“Storms are reaching areas where they’ve never been before with greater severity,” he added. “There is an increased need to widen the scope of what we think is vulnerable in our medical supply chain.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christina Jewett covers the Food and Drug Administration, which means keeping a close eye on drugs, medical devices, food safety and tobacco policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett">More about Christina Jewett</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
