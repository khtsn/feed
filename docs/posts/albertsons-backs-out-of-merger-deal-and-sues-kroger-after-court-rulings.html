Judge Adrienne Nelson of U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/kroger-albertsons-merger-ftc.html" title="">temporarily halted the deal</a> on Tuesday, siding with federal regulators who have argued that the merger would lessen competition at the expense of consumers and workers.</p><p>Another decision blocking the merger in Washington State court, issued by Judge Marshall Ferguson just one hour later, added to the hurdles facing the companies.</p><p>“Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive of Albertsons, said in a statement. “We are deeply disappointed in the courts’ decisions.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Wednesday, Albertsons also said it filed a lawsuit against Kroger in the Delaware Court of Chancery, seeking billions of dollars in damages and accusing Kroger of failing to exercise “best efforts” to secure regulatory approval. Kroger refused to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignored regulators’ feedback and rejected strong buyers of stores it had planned to divest, Albertsons said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.</p><p>Erin Rolfes, a spokeswoman for Kroger, disputed Albertsons’s claims, calling them “without merit.” Albertsons breached the merger agreement multiple times, she said in a statement, and the company filed the lawsuit in an attempt to deflect responsibility and seek payment for the merger’s termination fee.</p><p>“Kroger looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court,” Ms. Rolfes said. “We went to extraordinary lengths to uphold the merger agreement throughout the entirety of the regulatory process and the facts will make that abundantly clear.”</p><p>The supermarket chains spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past two years on the deal that would have created a $200 billion company with 5,000 supermarkets across the country. The companies argued that the merger was necessary to compete with giants like Walmart and Amazon and would lead to lower prices for shoppers.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/business/kroger-albertsons-merger-impact.html" title="">consolidating Kroger and Albertsons</a> would reduce head-to-head competition in over 1,000 communities, resulting in higher prices and lower quality, the F.T.C. argued in its post-hearing brief. The agency also contended that the deal would erode the bargaining power of unions and harm the combined companies’ roughly 700,000 employees, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The two chains have significant overlap in some markets, including Los Angeles, Seattle and Chicago. Kroger had taken steps to try to allay regulators’ concerns about market concentration in such areas. The company had said it would sell 579 Kroger and Albertsons stores to a third company, called C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, though regulators were skeptical that the store sales would resolve competition concerns.</p><p>The federal court decision in Oregon was a final success for Lina Khan, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/technology/election-2024-ftc-lina-khan.html" title="">outgoing head</a> of the F.T.C., who has pushed to scale back the power of some of the country’s biggest corporations. On Tuesday, President-elect Donald J. Trump named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html" title="">Andrew Ferguson</a>, a Republican who sits on the commission, to replace her as its head.</p><p>Shares of Albertsons rose about 1 percent in early morning trading, while Kroger’s stock ticked up roughly 1.5 percent.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The World’s Pioneering Tech Cop: </strong>Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s antitrust regulator, put technology’s harms on the global agenda.
