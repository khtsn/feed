Colorado early Sunday morning and detained more than 100 people who they said were undocumented immigrants, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p><p>The raid occurred at a club in Colorado Springs, about 70 miles south of Denver. Federal officials said there were more than 200 people inside the club at the time, including 114 who were in the country illegally. More than a dozen active-duty members of the U.S. military were detained as well, they said.</p><p>Officials said agents found weapons and illicit drugs inside the nightclub, including cocaine, methamphetamine and a mixture of powdered drugs known as pink cocaine.</p><p>Jonathan C. Pullen, the DEA Rocky Mountain Division special agent in charge, said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KOAA/videos/1182584313153473" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news conference</a> that the club had been under law enforcement surveillance for months and that “drug trafficking, prostitution and crimes of violence” had been taking place inside the club.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Pullen said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement took custody of the immigrants detained at the club. He said the members of the military were “running security at the club and involved in some of these crimes.”</p><p>The service members were handed over to the criminal investigation division of the U.S. Army.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Fort Carson, an Army post in Colorado, said in a statement on Sunday night that “there were some Fort Carson service members present at the location during” the raid.</p><p>“Each person involved in this incident is presumed innocent until proven guilty. We will look at everyone’s situation on a case-by-case basis,” the spokeswoman said. “Illegal activities of any kind do not represent our military values.”</p><p>Mr. Pullen said that during the investigation of the club, law enforcement officers saw members of the Hell’s Angels, MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gangs inside the club.</p><p>“I don’t have the information about whether those members were there tonight, but we’re still working through a lot of that, because we have so many people in custody,” Mr. Pullen said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The D.E.A. and several members of the Trump administration posted videos and photos of the raid on their social media accounts on Sunday.</p><p>In one <a href="https://x.com/DEAROCKYMTNDiv/status/1916459097404080541" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> posted on X by the D.E.A.’s Rocky Mountain Division, agents can be seen breaking through a window as red and blue police lights flash around them.
