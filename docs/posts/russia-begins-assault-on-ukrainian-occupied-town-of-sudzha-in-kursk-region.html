It had taken Moscow’s soldiers half a year to grind through Ukrainian defenses and reach the outskirts of the town earlier this year — at the cost of thousands of casualties by most estimates.</p><p>Ukraine’s glacial retreat suddenly turned into a rout in the past week.</p><p>Russian military analysts said the breakthrough in Kursk begun on Saturday with a surprise attack on the Ukrainian rear. Russian officials said 800 fighters walked about 10 miles through a disused gas pipeline measuring 4.5 feet wide to emerge inside Ukrainian-held territory and engage the enemy in Sudzha’s northern suburbs.</p><p>Russian propagandists and officials described the operation as a heroic feat, while Ukrainian sources called it a death sentence, with some Russian attackers allegedly suffocating from residual methane in the pipeline. That claim could not be independently verified.</p><p>“I respect them for this creativity,” said a Ukrainian military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. He added that the Russian attackers had suffered heavy casualties and that only 90 had made it from the pipeline into Sudzha.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainians carrying a dead Russian soldier after finding him in the rubble of a destroyed Sudzha border post in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>While the effectiveness of the pipeline operation is debatable, it coincided with breaches of Ukrainian defenses by Russian troops in several parts of Kursk.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen.
