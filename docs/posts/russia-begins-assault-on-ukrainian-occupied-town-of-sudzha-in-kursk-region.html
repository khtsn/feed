The advance puts Moscow on the verge of ending the first invasion of Russian territory since World War II.</p><p>“We have surrounded Sudzha from almost all sides,” Lt. Gen. Apti Alaudinov, a top Russian commander in Kursk, told Russian state television on Tuesday.</p><p>Russia’s recent rapid moves around Sudzha have erased a large share of the territorial gains made by Ukrainian forces during their surprise attack into western Russia in August. Kyiv had held on to territory in Kursk despite heavy casualties in the hope of using it as a bargaining chip in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-us-saudi-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">peace talks</a>.</p><p>Amid Ukraine’s advance, 2,000 to 3,000 Russian civilians had taken refuge in Sudzha by February, according to Russian activists and Ukrainian officials. Their fate is unclear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By Tuesday afternoon, Ukrainian forces had retreated from the eastern side of town across the Psel River, Ian Matveev, an antiwar Russian military analyst, <a href="https://t.me/arrowsmap/7705" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on his Telegram channel</a>. He cited videos posted on social media of Russian soldiers in the town. Deepstate, a Ukrainian group with ties to the Ukrainian Army that maps the battlefield, made a similar assessment on Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Matveev wrote that it remained unclear whether Ukrainian soldiers would try to mount a defense in the western side of Sudzha or continue retreating toward the Ukrainian border, a few miles west.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, Russian state media published a <a href="https://x.com/DD_Geopolitics/status/1899407494008479746" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photo of a Russian soldier</a> standing at the eastern entrance of Sudzha, a county seat in Kursk that became the main logistical and administrative hub for Ukraine’s occupation forces. The New York Times verified the location of the photo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Tuesday morning, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its forces had liberated 12 Kursk villages and 38 square miles in the past 24 hours, and analysts speculated that Ukraine’s presence in Russia could end within days.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Kursk offensive is part of a wider effort by Russia and Ukraine to improve their positions ahead of peace talks mediated by the Trump administration, the Russian military analyst Valery Shiryaev <a href="https://t.me/Shiryaev_and_Shiryaev/387" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on his Telegram channel</a> on Monday.</p><p>As Moscow’s forces pressed forward in Kursk, Ukraine on Tuesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-russia-moscow-war-drones.html" title="">launched the largest drone attack on Russian cities</a> since the start of the war, a move that analysts interpreted as an attempt by Kyiv to show Washington that it can still take the fight to Russia.</p><p>“Everyone is putting on the table the cards that they have,” Mr. Shiryaev wrote.</p><p>The rapid crumbling of Ukrainian defenses around Sudzha signals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/kursk-russia-war-ukraine.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">an end to Kyiv’s determined attempts to hold on to captured Russian</a> territory, which at its peak measured more than 500 square miles. To keep the territory, Ukraine had transferred to Kursk some of its best reserves, a strategy that critics said weakened Kyiv’s ability to defend itself against Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Local residents hiding in a basement in Sudzha, Russia, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Efrem Lukatsky/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Ukrainian officials have repeatedly defended their strategy in Kursk in political terms, saying that territory could be traded for land that Russia has occupied in Ukraine — a possibility that was vanishing rapidly by Tuesday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Russian soldiers and commanders fighting in Kursk previously said in interviews that they had expected the battle for Sudzha to last months and become one of the bloodiest standoffs of the three-year war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It had taken Moscow’s soldiers half a year to grind through Ukrainian defenses and reach the outskirts of the town earlier this year — at the cost of thousands of casualties by most estimates.</p><p>Ukraine’s glacial retreat suddenly turned into a rout in the past week.</p><p>Russian military analysts said the breakthrough in Kursk began on Saturday with a surprise attack on the Ukrainian rear. Russian officials said 800 fighters walked about 10 miles through a disused gas pipeline measuring 4.5 feet wide to emerge inside Ukrainian-held territory and engage the enemy in Sudzha’s northern suburbs.</p><p>Russian propagandists and officials described the operation as a heroic feat, while Ukrainian sources called it a death sentence, with some Russian attackers allegedly suffocating from residual methane in the pipeline. That claim could not be independently verified.</p><p>“I respect them for this creativity,” said a Ukrainian military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. He added that the Russian attackers had suffered heavy casualties and that only 90 had made it from the pipeline into Sudzha.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainians carrying a dead Russian soldier after finding him in the rubble of a destroyed Sudzha border post in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>While the effectiveness of the pipeline operation is debatable, it coincided with breaches of Ukrainian defenses by Russian troops in several parts of Kursk.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Monday night that Kyiv was dispatching reinforcements to Kursk, but rejected Russian claims that a large contingent of Ukrainian soldiers there was at risk of encirclement.</p><p>“A decision was made to reinforce our group with the necessary forces and resources,” he said. He added that Ukrainian forces were retreating to more favorable defensive positions, which some commentators interpreted as a possible prelude to a complete withdrawal from Kursk.</p><p>Russian military analysts said a withdrawal was likely to merely shift the battle to Ukrainian territory, pitting Kyiv’s forces in the Sumy region that borders Kursk against tens of thousands Russian soldiers and their North Korean allies.</p><p>Sanjana Varghese<!-- -->, <!-- -->Marc Santora<!-- --> and <!-- -->Michael Schwirtz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
