In Gaza, Hamas failed to release a female hostage whom Israel had hoped would be freed on Saturday, prompting Israel to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostage-prisoner-swap.html" title="">delay the agreed return</a> of displaced Palestinians to their homes in northern Gaza.</p><p>But even as each side accused the other of reneging on their deals, analysts said, both Israel and its opponents had reasons to remain flexible and temporarily overlook the other’s transgressions.</p><p>Hezbollah, though angry at Israel for keeping troops in southern Lebanon, would risk a devastating Israeli counterattack if it renews its rocket strikes on Israeli cities. Hamas wants to retain power in Gaza and risks losing it if war returns. And Israel needs to maintain the current arrangement in Gaza long enough to free at least two dozen more hostages. Israeli leaders have also appeared eager to placate President Trump, who campaigned on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-president-promises.html" title="">a promise to keep peace</a> in the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Illustrating their desire to prolong the Gaza truce, Israel and Hamas seemed to resolve the weekend’s crisis close to midnight on Sunday. The government of Qatar, a mediator between the sides, said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/middleeast/arbel-yehud-israel-hostage-hamas.html" title="">the female hostage, Arbel Yehud</a>, would be freed this week along with two others who would be released ahead of schedule. In return, Israel said that it would allow displaced Palestinians to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/27/world/israel-hamas-lebanon-gaza" title="">return to northern Gaza</a> on Monday morning.</p><p>As for Lebanon, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/white-house-statement-on-agreement-extension-between-lebanon-and-israel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the White House announced</a> that the truce there would be extended until Feb. 18, though there was no immediate comment from Israel or Hezbollah. The Lebanese prime minister’s office confirmed the extension.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
