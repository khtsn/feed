The Trump administration froze foreign aid for 90 days and has planned to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development to just 5 percent of its work force, although a federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/07/us/trump-administration-updates/judge-will-freeze-elements-of-trump-plan-to-shut-down-usaid?smid=url-share" title="">paused the plan</a> on Friday. Given wars and strapped economies, other governments or philanthropies are unlikely to make up for the shortfall, and recipient nations are too hamstrung by debt to manage on their own.</p><p>Even the largest organizations are unlikely to emerge unscathed. In interviews, more than 25 aid workers, former U.S.A.I.D. employees and officials from aid organizations described a system thrown into mass confusion and chaos.</p><p>A tower of blocks may take hours to build, but “you pull one of those blocks out and it collapses,” said Mitchell Warren, executive director of the H.I.V. prevention organization AVAC, which relied on U.S.A.I.D. for 38 percent of its funding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“You’ve gotten rid of all of the staff, all of the institutional memory, all of the trust and confidence, not only in the United States but in the dozens of countries in which U.S.A.I.D. works,” Mr. Warren said. “Those things have taken decades to build up but two weeks to destroy.”</p><p>Small organizations, some with as few as 10 employees, have folded. Some midsize organizations have furloughed up to 80 percent of their employees. Even large organizations — including Catholic Relief Services and FHI 360, among the biggest recipients of U.S.A.I.D. funding — have announced large <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/exclusive-catholic-relief-services-lays-staff-cuts-programs-after-usaid-shakeup" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">layoffs</a> or <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article299871939.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">furloughs</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A U.S.A.I.D. delivery of Covid tests to Honduras in April 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Orlando Sierra/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/accountabilitylab/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one survey</a>, about 1 in 4 nonprofits said they might last a month; more than half said they had enough reserves to survive for three months at most.</p><p>The damage is compounded by President Trump’s announcement that the United States would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/health/who-us-withdrawal.html" title="">withdraw from the World Health Organization</a>, forcing its leaders to announce cost-cutting measures of their own. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Global health experts said that the future suddenly looked uncertain, even dystopian, and struggled to articulate alternatives.</p><p>“We are quite clear that the future looks different,” said Christine Stegling, a deputy executive director at UNAIDS, the United Nations’ H.I.V. division.

One large organization received less than 5 percent of its expected budget for the period, but others have received nothing.</p><p>“I obviously welcome that the secretary approved a waiver and put a post on the internet, but we cannot pay our bills with the post,” a senior official at a large organization said of Mr. Rubio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Some groups feel morally obligated to continue to provide lifesaving services, hoping that they will eventually be reimbursed.

Many of the clinics have shuttered, some permanently, said Anu Kumar, the organization’s president.</p><p>The speed of the disruption did not allow clinics time to make contingency plans or taper their dependence on the funding, she said, adding, “This definitely has a ripple effect.”</p><p>After one week of the freeze, more than 900,000 women and girls will have been denied reproductive care, a figure that will <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2025/01/family-planning-impact-trump-foreign-assistance-freeze" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grow to 11.7 million</a> over the 90-day pause, according to the Guttmacher Institute. “That’s more than the entire population of North Carolina,” Dr. Kumar said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>As a result, the institute estimated, 4.2 million girls and women will experience unintended pregnancies, and 8,340 will die from complications during pregnancy and childbirth.</p><p>Many H.I.V. programs were focused on “key populations” at highest risk, including transgender people and men who have sex with men, who are marginalized and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/health/uganda-lgbtq-hiv.html" title="">criminalized</a> in some countries.</p><p>In Uganda, for instance, where a harsh anti-gay law can carry the death penalty for consensual homosexual activity for people with H.I.V., nonprofit groups funded by the United States have been crucial sources of financial and medical support.</p><p>“It’s something every American should be proud about, but I don’t think they know it,” said Kenneth Mwehonge, executive director of the Coalition for Health Promotion and Social Development, which monitors the quality of other H.I.V. programs in Uganda.</p><p>“I don’t think they know how much they’ve contributed and the lives they’ve saved, and they don’t celebrate it enough,” he said.

Others helped governments protect against diseases like polio and measles in conflict zones and among nomadic groups. Still others provided expertise in containing outbreaks of dangerous pathogens like Ebola and Marburg, which are smoldering in Uganda and Tanzania.</p><p>Any of these threats, if not contained, could easily cross borders and land on America’s shores, said Rebecca Wolfe, who worked at the U.S.A.I.D.-funded nonprofit Mercy Corps for 15 years and is now a development expert at the University of Chicago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The world “is so interconnected, and to try to divide it into ‘America first’ and the rest no longer works in today’s age,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-5cbad94f">‘It feels like grief’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mercy Githinji cared for 100 households in the Kayole neighborhood of Nairobi when the clinic where she worked, run by the U.S.A.I.D.
