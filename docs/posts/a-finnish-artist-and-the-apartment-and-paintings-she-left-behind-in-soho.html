She moved to 133 Greene Street in 1966, when the district was a rubbly artists’ refuge. Later, she relocated to a sixth-floor unit in the building next door (both cast-iron structures were combined into a single co-op, 133-137 Greene Street, in the late 1970s. The entrance — and current address — is at 135 Greene Street). As high-fashion boutiques sprouted around her and her neighbors bought and renovated some of the most expensive property in the city, she collected the refunds from cans and bottles and later relied on subsidies from a <a href="https://www.tuttlefund.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charitable organization</a> to stay afloat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-1"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The two addresses the artist occupied at various times were combined into a single co-op in the late 1970s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Leino built the racks that held her paintings and made other improvements to the raw space herself.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Today, a 2,100-square-foot unit in the co-op rents for $12,500 per month. Ms. Leino was busy accumulating her own kind of treasure. At her death, she left more than 1,000 artworks that she had made over half a century.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Both the artist and her works are now objects of wonder. On Sept. 4, <a href="https://www.harpersgallery.com/artists/iria-leino#tab:thumbnails" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harper’s Gallery</a>, in Manhattan, will exhibit a small selection of Ms. Leino’s canvases. Peter Hastings Falk, an art historian and independent curator, who is managing the collection for the Iria Leino Trust, said, “We’re making the bold statement, which I think is true, that she’s the first woman abstract painter from Finland, in America.”</p><p>And the loft has attracted not just art dealers, but also documentary filmmakers and Finnish cultural officials entranced by its time-capsule quality.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/02/multimedia/02leino-hall/02leino-hall-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/02/multimedia/02leino-hall/02leino-hall-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/02/multimedia/02leino-hall/02leino-hall-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Paintings hang on the walls above works that are leaning on the floor of a narrow passageway." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/02/multimedia/02leino-hall/02leino-01-mvct-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/02/multimedia/02leino-hall/02leino-01-mvct-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/02/multimedia/02leino-hall/02leino-01-mvct-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/02/multimedia/02leino-hall/02leino-01-mvct-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Few surfaces in the 4,000-square-foot apartment are void of art. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Steps lead to a sleeping loft in Ms. Leino’s bedroom.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“When I walked into the apartment it was like walking into the prime time of the New York art scene, when everyone was living in these illegal lofts in SoHo,” said Kati Laakso, the executive director of the Finnish Cultural Institute in New York. Visiting not long after Ms. Leino’s death, Ms. Laakso saw stacks of canvases filling the big, dusty rooms, and floors strewed with papers. An entire room held racks of clothing, including cotton print Marimekko dresses from the 1960s. And shoes. So many shoes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“It was a mind blow,” Ms. Laakso said.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-10"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bookcase with meditation aids is visible from the artist’s bed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Portrait of Swami Satchidananda Saraswati, Ms. Leino’s spiritual leader and occasional subject.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Ms. Leino’s loft was a single raw room that she partitioned into a maze, recounted Corbin Frame, who worked periodically as her assistant in the 1980s and ’90s. Apart from the walk-in closet and a small bedroom with a crudely constructed elevated bed, every space was dedicated to painting.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The guest room was used after Ms. Leino’s death to organize her archives.

Her biggest successes came from an entirely different vocation.</p><p>Born Taiteilija Irja Leino in 1932, she was raised by a family friend after her mother died in 1938. As a young woman, she studied art and fashion design in Finland, then moved to Paris, where she had received a scholarship to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and where she also worked as a fashion journalist and model.</p><p>By the 1950s, she had become a modeling sensation, said Mr. Falk, who has written about Ms. Leino for his online publication “<a href="https://discoveriesinamericanart.com/artists/iria-leino/#1540843962475-b2345d27-df5c5a31-813d-bio" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discoveries in American Art</a>.” She walked the runways for couture houses including Pierre Balmain and Christian Dior, and was known for wearing a swooping hairstyle called the Nouvelle Vague, or new wave, a sassy reference to the French art film movement. When the name she used, Irja (pronounced EAR-ee-ya), was misspelled in a modeling session, she appropriated the error and became Iria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In her 20s, Ms. Leino was a celebrated model in Paris. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Photos show a stunning, wide-cheeked blond with an attitude.

Some canvases are fluttery abstractions reminiscent of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/arts/design/larry-poons-new-paintings.html" title="">the artist Larry Poons</a>, with whom she studied at the Art Students League in New York. Some are covered in gobs of plasticky paint bearing the swipe marks of her fingers. Some are portraits of Swami Satchidananda, who was one of her rare figurative subjects. (She also executed a nonrepresentational series called “Buddhist Rain” and was known to paint while chanting mantras.) Some are the size of baby whales. Stuck to one notable canvas, called “Homecoming (After)” are two pairs of high-heeled shoes and a few whiskey bottles.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In 1978, the building on Greene Street went co-op, and the new owners sought to remove Ms. Leino, first by bribery and then legal action. She told Barbara Rachko, an artist friend, that she refused a million-dollar offer to relocate. “Where would I find something else this big?” she asked. Lawyers working pro bono fought off eviction in the <a href="https://www.anylaw.com/case/killington-investors-v-iria-leino/new-york-supreme-court/03-14-1989/T71GVmYBTlTomsSB70lk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supreme Court of New York County</a>.</p><p>“It’s interesting that she managed to be the lone holdout up to the end,” Ms. Rachko said.</p><p>Ms. Leino’s dog-bone stubbornness sometimes worked to her advantage, friends and admirers said, but also made her prone to self sabotage. Mr. Falk recalled a journal entry where she described the famed art dealer Leo Castelli visiting the loft and complimenting one of her works composed of acrylic paint scraped off a hard surface and applied to the canvas like tattered skin.</p><p>“She was brusque,” Mr. Falk said. “She turned him off.”</p><p>Mr. Frame said, “She was protective of her creative space, of course. With her accent, she could sound very harsh.” He abruptly barked the word “No!” in demonstration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Detail of “The King’s Crown.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Even close allies felt the chill of her insularity. Varpu Sihvonen, a Finnish journalist who met the artist in New York in the 1990s and is at work on a biography of her, recalled their meetings at the loft: “You would think if you were a good friend, you could just drop by, but no, you had to make an appointment. If you rang the doorbell and hadn’t made an appointment, she wouldn’t let you in.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Once admitted, Ms. Sihvonen said she was confined by unspoken agreement to the kitchen. In all their years of friendship, she saw only two or three of Ms. Leino’s completed paintings and none that was in progress.</p><p>“That was the story of her life: Don’t let people in,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hand-cranked machines used for mixing plaster flank a Buddha statue.

She owned a small, walk-up apartment in the Sixth Arrondissement of Paris and a crumbling farmhouse with a sea view in the Sicilian town of Taormina.</p><p>Six years ago, she met Robert Alan Saasto, a Finnish American lawyer whose own mother had been a painter. She authorized him to sell her Paris home for about $650,000 and set up a trust with the proceeds. (The Italian property had long been taken over by squatters and remains embroiled in a legal dispute.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>“She refused to touch any of the trust money,” Mr. Saasto recalled. Neither would she accept the mattress he wanted to buy to replace the pancake-thin one on her loft bed, despite her frequent complaints about back pain. At this point she was well in her 80s.</p><p>Ms. Leino also rejected offers to help market her paintings, Mr. Saasto said, though she gave him permission to use the funds to catalog, clean and prepare them for sale after her death.</p><p>According to Mr. Saasto, Ms. Leino left most of her estate, including any revenue that came from the sale of her art, to the Integral Yoga Society and its sister organization, Yogaville, an ashram founded by Swami Satchidananda in Virginia.</p><p>Radha Metro-Midkiff, the executive director of the Integral Yoga Institute, said, “It’s not unusual for this to happen where Swami Satchidananda made such a huge impact on someone’s life they make some sort of bequest.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Leino often used short strokes in her work to evoke rain. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Katherine Marks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>As for the loft, it continues to bear Ms. Leino’s imprint and her hundreds of pictures, some so large that they will have to be removed from their stretchers and rolled up to be carried away. The unit can now be sold, though the lawyer representing the building’s owners declined to disclose when it will be put on the market or what the asking price will be. (The median listing price of a home in SoHo as of June was $4.8 million, according to Realtor.com.)</p><p>Joshua Charow, a photographer who is the author of the book “<a href="https://www.joshuacharow.com/book/loftlaw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loft Law: The Last of New York City’s Artist Lofts</a>,” said his best guess is that a few hundred of these properties remain, remnants of a policy from the charmed early ’80s. “It’s important to remember that this is not just a part of New York City’s past but its present,” he said. “These artists are still here; they’re still creating amazing works.”</p></div></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/02/realestate/soho-artist-iria-leino-paintings.html">53</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/02/realestate/soho-artist-iria-leino-paintings.html">53</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Art and Museums in New York City</h2><h3>A guide to the shows, exhibitions and artists shaping the city’s cultural landscape.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Two Eco Art Installations:</strong> Two sculptors, whose works are being shown in TriBeCa and on Governors Island, stray from the crowd with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/arts/design/eco-art-jenny-kendler-michael-wang.html">ambiguous, beautiful and frightening ecological works</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Odd Duck of Antiguan Art: </strong>At the Drawing Center in Manhattan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/arts/design/frank-walter-drawing-center.html">the revival of the Antiguan artist Frank Walter</a> continues with a stack of his written archive displayed alongside his paintings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bronx Museum’s Executive Director Leaves: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/arts/design/bronx-museum-klaudio-rodriguez.html">Klaudio Rodriguez is leaving his position</a> at the museum, which<strong> </strong>recently began a $33 million expansion and renovation project, to lead the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Man on Wire,’ Fifty Years Later: </strong>The high-wire artist Philippe Petit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/arts/philippe-petit-world-trade-center-50.html">has a new show</a> commemorating the 50th anniversary of his walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
