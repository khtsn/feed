Dr. Ruvkun’s award was actually the fourth Nobel Prize resulting from C. elegans research, cementing the lowly soil worm’s outsize role in scientific discovery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The one-millimeter nematode has helped scientists understand how healthy cells are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/health/genetics/american-and-2-britons-win-nobel-for-studies-on-cell-death.html" title="">instructed to kill themselves</a> and how the process goes awry in AIDS, strokes and degenerative diseases. (That work was the subject of the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2002/summary/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a>.)</p><p>Self-proclaimed “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/science/03nobel.html" title="">worm people</a>” were recognized by the Nobel committee in 2006 for discovering gene silencing, which became the basis for an entirely new class of drugs. Two years later, the chemistry prize went to scientists who used nematodes to help invent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/science/09nobel.html" title="">cellular “lanterns”</a> that allowed biologists to see the inner workings of a cell.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/00nobelworm-wztl/00nobelworm-wztl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/00nobelworm-wztl/00nobelworm-wztl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/00nobelworm-wztl/00nobelworm-wztl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A grayscale microscope image of a nemotode in a curled position with four embryos attached to its side." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/00nobelworm-wztl/00nobelworm-wztl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/00nobelworm-wztl/00nobelworm-wztl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/00nobelworm-wztl/00nobelworm-wztl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/00nobelworm-wztl/00nobelworm-wztl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="600"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>C. elegans with embryos attached to its body.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Cormack</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/mello_lecture.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">each</a> <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/chalfie_lecture.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prize</a>, a laureate made sure to thank the worm for its contributions, though perhaps the most famous nod came from Sydney Brenner, who won the first “worm Nobel.”</p><p>“Without doubt, the fourth winner of the Nobel Prize this year is Caenorhabditis elegans,” he said in his <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/brenner-lecture.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lecture</a> in Stockholm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It deserves all of the honor, but of course it will not be able to share the monetary award.”</p><p>Dr. Brenner, often thought of as the father of C. elegans research, is the closest thing there is to a worm celebrity. He is credited with popularizing C. elegans in laboratories worldwide, after spending almost a decade hunting for the perfect research model.</p><p>Worm scientists sometimes define themselves by how removed they are from Dr. Brenner’s lab — “first generation” researchers worked with him directly, while the “second generation” worked with scientists who worked with him.</p><p>C. elegans is named after the Latin word for “elegant” because of the way it moves in graceful, sinusoidal waves. One of the animal’s virtues is its simplicity, which allows scientists to test hypotheses about fundamental biological concepts in a model that is easy to understand.</p><p>The nematodes have just 959 cells — a remarkably manageable number, compared with our trillions of cells — each of which scientists <a href="https://www.wormatlas.org/celllistsulston.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have named</a> and charted from fertilization to death.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/autossell/nobel-worm-vid2/nobel-worm-vid2-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/autossell/nobel-worm-vid2/nobel-worm-vid2-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/11/127775_1_00nobel-worm-vid2_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">C. elegans moving under the microscope, showing fluorescent proteins inside of it.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Luisa Cochella Lab</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“This is probably the best-understood multicellular organism on the planet,” said Howard Ferris, a nematologist at the University of California, Davis.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The destiny of each cell is easy to map, since the worms become translucent under the light of a microscope and cycle through all developmental stages in about three days.</p><p>The nematode was the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/25520394/online-education-kit-1998-genome-of-roundworm-c-elegans-sequenced" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first animal</a> to have its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/11/us/animal-s-genetic-program-decoded-in-a-science-first.html" title="">genome entirely deciphered</a> — in 1998, years before scientists were able to do the same for flies and mice. The worm is also inexpensive, easy to store and entirely self-sufficient when it comes to reproduction; female C. elegans have functional sperm that allow them to inseminate themselves.</p><p>“It’s an experimental dream,” said Judith Kimble, a nematode researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “The more we do with it, the more of a wonderful dream it becomes.”</p><p>Even when scientists come to nematology for the worms, they often stay for the tightly knit, offbeat community.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Since its inception, the field has had a tradition of collaboration. Researchers created a newsletter in 1975 called the <a href="http://wbg.wormbook.org/wli/tocs/wbg01.1.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worm Breeder’s Gazette</a> to share the results of their experiments before they were published.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Worm Breeder’s Gazette, a newsletter from Robert Edgar of U.C.

Had they not, their prizewinning work might have been delayed years, even decades.</p><p>The C. elegans research community comes together every other year at the International Worm Convention, where the scientists traipse about in their signature garb: sweatshirts, shorts and Birkenstocks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>There are nematode-friendly comedy performances and art competitions, where scientists have entered <a href="https://airtable.com/appcLqnTcGT9N8GE9/shr6SnUauhkS26QqC/tbl0eIuxJzW79PEgR/viwbOQVVLH0yY3ZGn/recUwJcL1LOM4im8P" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ceramic</a>, <a href="https://x.com/sci_bastian/status/1672260846498590720" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wool</a>, <a href="https://airtable.com/appcLqnTcGT9N8GE9/shr6SnUauhkS26QqC/tbl0eIuxJzW79PEgR/viwbOQVVLH0yY3ZGn/receTSBDXYwX7QgYS" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wooden</a> and <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/516660-fluorescent-c-elegans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3-D-printed</a> tributes to their favorite organism. At night, there are dance parties where, yes, some scientists have been known to do the worm.</p><p>This collective spirit stands in stark contrast to some other corners of biology, like fly research, where scientists tend to guard their research and compete with one another, said Cathy Savage-Dunn, who studies cell signaling in C. elegans at the City University of New York.</p><p>Indeed, there is something of a rivalry between fly researchers and worm scientists. The latter are fond of saying that flies are too complex and fly science conferences too stuffy.</p><p>But the two groups agree that their research is dismissed by mammal scientists, who reside on top of the unspoken lab animal hierarchy and often believe that experiments on invertebrates are irrelevant to humans.</p><p>In fact, the discovery of microRNA was first met with silence outside the C. elegans community, in part because other scientists thought the original findings were just a quirk of worms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>It wasn’t until years later, when Dr. Ruvkun proved that microRNA was present in a wide array of animals, including humans, that the wider research community finally acquiesced.</p><p>Even though worms are leagues simpler than the human body, we have more in common than we might believe, said Robert Waterston, a geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p><p>“If we understand the worm, we understand life,” he said. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Teddy Rosenbluth is a health reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
