The most recent — and the most notorious, perhaps — came after the 1979 assassination of President Park Chung-hee, a former general who had occasionally used martial law himself to crack down on political protests and opposition since seizing power in 1961.</p><p>Soon after Mr. Park was killed, a general, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/world/asia/chun-doo-hwan-dead.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">Chun Doo-hwan</a>, staged his own coup. In May 1980, he declared martial law, banning all political activities, closing schools and arresting dissidents.</p><p>Protests erupted in the southwestern city of Gwangju, and Mr. Chun sent in armored vehicles and paratroopers, who crushed the uprising. Officials said at least 191 people were killed, including 26 soldiers and police officers, but families of slain demonstrators said the death toll was much higher.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Chun, who remained in power until 1988, characterized the Gwangju protests as a revolt driven by North Korean operatives. But the uprising became a pivotal moment in South Korea’s transition to democracy, and many South Koreans support <a href="https://constitutionnet.org/news/south-korea-office-president-rejects-amendment-proposal-modify-constitutional-preamble" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revising the Constitution</a> to honor its importance to the country.</p><p>In 1996, Mr. Chun and another former general, Roh Tae-woo — a childhood friend of Mr. Chun who backed his rule and was directly elected president in 1988 — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/11/world/trial-of-2-former-presidents-begins-in-korea.html" title="">were prosecuted for the 1979 coup</a> and the deadly crackdown that followed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Roh Tae-woo, left, and Chun Doo-hwan on trial in 1996.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yonhap/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>President Kim Young-sam, who served from 1993 to 1998, said at the time of the prosecutions that they marked a <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?params=/context/wilj/article/1119/&amp;path_info=mart.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new era of constitutionalism for Korea</a>.
