He said the military will also support President Trump’s priority “to end wars responsibly,” presumably a reference to the war in Ukraine as well as the conflicts in the Middle East.</p><p>“All of this will be done with a focus on lethality, meritocracy, accountability, standards and readiness,” Mr. Hegseth said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
