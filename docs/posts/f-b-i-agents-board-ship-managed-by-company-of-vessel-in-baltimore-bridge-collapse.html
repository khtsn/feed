The Dali is owned by Grace Ocean Ltd., also based in Singapore.</p><p>Officials did not provide more details on Saturday’s boarding and did not say if it was connected to the Justice Department’s lawsuit or a separate federal criminal investigation into the crash that remains active. </p><p>The Maersk Saltoro is sailing under the Singaporean flag and is on its way to Sri Lanka, according to VesselFinder, a ship tracking website. Grace Ocean did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.</p><p>The Justice Department lawsuit, which was filed in federal court on Wednesday in Maryland, described a series of failures onboard that resulted in the Dali losing power and slamming into the Key Bridge on March 26. The disaster could have been prevented at multiple points, the suit asserts, pointing to poor maintenance and “jury-rigged” fixes to serious problems aboard the ship.</p><p>The early-morning collapse of the bridge killed the six men who were repairing pavement on it and paralyzed the Port of Baltimore for weeks. On Tuesday, the families of three of the men who were killed announced that they were also suing the owner of the Dali.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
