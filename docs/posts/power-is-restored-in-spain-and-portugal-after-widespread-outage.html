The trains in Madrid’s subway system <a href="https://x.com/metro_madrid/status/1917109968399913443" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were rolling</a> on all but one line. And waiters were serving food and generous pours of beer and wine to patrons on restaurant terraces along quieter-than-normal streets.</p><p>A day after Spain and Portugal were hit by extensive blackouts, electricity had returned to most areas of both countries on Tuesday, leaving many relieved but also sharply critical about what exactly had caused the widespread power failure.</p><p>Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said his country had recovered more than 95 percent of the total supply by 6.30 a.m. Tuesday. In neighboring Portugal, a spokesperson for the electricity and gas supplier REN said that power had been restored to all the substations of the country’s grid and that everything was “100 percent operational.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/power-outage-spain-portugal-france.html" title="">cause of the blackout</a>, which stranded tens of millions of people on the Iberian Peninsula, remained unknown Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Eduardo Prieto, the director of services for Spain’s national power company, Red Eléctrica, said that there were no “definitive conclusions” as to the reasons for the outage.</p><p>He joined a chorus of officials who declared that there had been no cybersecurity attack. But he also ruled out human error and meteorological causes.</p><p>He said that the Spanish electricity system had shut down after being hit by two separate power outages, just a second and a half apart.</p><p>“This may seem like a small amount,” he said, “but in the electrical world, it’s a significant amount.” He said that the shutdowns had occurred in southwestern Spain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/29int-spain-power-pmjh/29int-spain-power-pmjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/29int-spain-power-pmjh/29int-spain-power-pmjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/29int-spain-power-pmjh/29int-spain-power-pmjh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A crowd of people in a busy train station." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/29int-spain-power-pmjh/29int-spain-power-pmjh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/29int-spain-power-pmjh/29int-spain-power-pmjh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/29int-spain-power-pmjh/29int-spain-power-pmjh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/multimedia/29int-spain-power-pmjh/29int-spain-power-pmjh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/6d32c118-034a-50d6-9db5-29dd21029235" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Passengers at the Atocha station in Madrid on Tuesday as life gradually returned to normal after the blackout.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manu Fernandez/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Sánchez said that his government’s second priority, after ensuring that the country’s electricity system had been fully restored, was to analyze what had caused the shutdown — both through a technical analysis committee at the national level and through the European Commission.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Citizens must be clear that the Spanish government will get to the bottom of this matter and implement the necessary measures to ensure this never happens again, and we will hold private operators accountable,” Mr. Sánchez said at a news conference.</p><p>Though Mr. Sanchez said that he expected answers within the next “hours or days,” Kristian Ruby, secretary general of Eurelectric, a trade body that represents the European electricity industry, said that it could take weeks or even months to complete the technical analysis required.</p><p>But some initial information has already emerged, he said. Around noon on Monday, a high-voltage connection between France and Spain was interrupted. The power outage occurred just over 30 minutes later, at 12:33.</p><p>While that interruption would have been disruptive, it would not normally lead to a “system collapse” like that seen on Monday, Mr. Ruby said. Something more would typically need to happen, “like a sudden outage at a power plant, a sudden development on the demand side,” he said. “Then you can have an incident like this.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Ruby said the outages were “somewhere on the scale between a 50- to 100-year event.”</p><p>Both Spain and Portugal shut down on Monday afternoon. Traffic lights went dark, trains and subways halted, elevators stopped — often with people stuck inside.</p><p>Businesses, factories and schools shut down, and airports delayed and canceled flights.</p><p>There were also problems connecting to the internet and to phone networks, leaving many bewildered and unable to access information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shopping for groceries by flashlight in Lisbon on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adri Salido/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When the power returned Monday evening, and the lights suddenly turned back on, cheers erupted across Madrid.</p><p>In cities across the two countries, life was returning in spurts on Tuesday. While subways were back up in Madrid and Lisbon, Spain’s national railway system reported that many of its commuter trains had reduced service or were canceled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Spanish transport ministry reported that all airports were operating. In Portugal, the infrastructure minister, Miguel Pinto Luz, announced that it would take “two or three days” for flights to return to normal at Lisbon’s international airport.</p><p>“Yesterday, there were practically no flights, and they were backed up with today’s flights,” Mr. Pinto Luz told the news channel Now.</p><p>Mobile phone and fiber optic service were working again in most of Spain.</p><p>The Madrid Open, an international tennis tournament, was back <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/news/madrid-2025-schedule-after-power-outage" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up and running</a> on Tuesday afternoon after the outage forced the cancellation of 22 matches on Monday.</p><p>“It seems like everything is better today, but I don’t understand how something like this is possible with all the technology we have today,” said Doroteo García, an 87-year-old retiree, walking with difficulty near a Madrid train station. He had spent the day before trapped in his apartment, he added, because the elevator was not working.</p><p>“I lived off canned sardines all day because I couldn’t cook,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Disembarking from a rail car near Cordoba, Spain, on Monday, after power cuts stopped the train.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Javier Soriano/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Though the power was back on, the Spanish capital was not quite back to its bustling self. Many people stayed home. Schools were open, but few with regular classes.</p><p>In Lisbon, schools and playgrounds filled with peals of laughter Tuesday afternoon, parks were populated with exercise enthusiasts running or practicing yoga, and the streets were busy with workers heading to jobs around town. Grocery stores, which had shut down during the brief crisis, were back to business. Restaurants and stores opened and, for the most part, seemed mostly unaffected by the outages.</p><p>Azam Ahmed<!-- --> contributed reporting from Lisbon; and Jonathan Wolfe from Murcia, Spain.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Catherine Porter is an international reporter for The Times, covering France.
