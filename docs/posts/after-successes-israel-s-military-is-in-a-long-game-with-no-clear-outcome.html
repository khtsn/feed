After a string of successes for Israel in Lebanon in recent days, he said, the question is, “Then what?”</p><p>Over the past year, after recovering from the initial shock of the Hamas-led assault, the Israeli military has conducted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">a grinding and deadly counteroffensive in Gaza</a>. Israel said recently that it had largely dismantled Hamas’s military infrastructure, reducing the militants’ capabilities to that of a guerrilla force.</p><p>That has come at a heavy price. More than 41,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the local health authorities, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The toll has brought Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/16/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas-rafah" title="">international opprobrium</a>.

Then, too, Israel intercepted most of them with the help of the United States and other allies.In July, Israel killed a top Hezbollah military commander in Lebanon and Hamas’s political leader while he was visiting Tehran. In September, thousands of Hezbollah operatives were killed or maimed when their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" title="">pagers and walkie-talkies simultaneously exploded</a>, and Israeli warplanes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-deaths.html" title="">bombarded thousands of targets</a> in Lebanon.</p><p>Since the attack that killed Mr. Nasrallah, Israel has continued striking to try to degrade as many Hezbollah assets as possible, along with some other targets in Lebanon where it began ground operations this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>John Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, told ABC this weekend that Israel had nearly eradicated Hezbollah’s command structure and destroyed thousands of its missiles and drones. “There is no question that the Hezbollah today is not the Hezbollah” of even a week ago, he said.</p><p>Israel’s display of military and technological prowess has also most likely helped to re-establish it as an “anchor of strength” in the region and as a balance against Iran and its proxies, according to Yaakov Amidror, an Israeli former major general and former national security adviser.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hezbollah supporters at a funeral in September in a Beirut suburb for four people killed in explosions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Whereas Hamas caught Israel off guard last October, the country’s forces were prepared for the Lebanon campaign. Nearly a decade ago, the military warned about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/world/middleeast/israel-says-hezbollah-positions-put-lebanese-at-risk.html" title="">Hezbollah’s embedding military infrastructure</a> in southern Lebanese villages close to the border with Israel.</p><p>And unlike Israel’s stated aim of destroying Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in Gaza, the government set a more modest goal for the campaign in Lebanon: to allow the roughly 60,000 residents of Israeli border areas evacuated last October to return to their homes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, has said that the war against Hezbollah will proceed in stages, giving the group a chance to back down at each point and move its forces from the border. On Tuesday, Israel’s military said it had carried out dozens of secret raids in Lebanese territory near the border in recent months and had embarked on the ground operation in southern Lebanon.</p><p>After that, experts said, Israel’s end game is unclear.</p><p>In Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/world/middleeast/hostages-in-gaza-hamas.html" title="">more than 100 people</a> seized during the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7 are still being held, some alive and some dead, and no imminent end to the war is on the horizon. About 350 soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the ground invasion began last October, Israel says.</p><p>Given the history, Israel could get equally bogged down in Lebanon. After Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, it took it 18 years to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/24/world/retreat-lebanon-israelis-barak-declares-end-tragedy-last-troops-leave-lebanon.html" title="">withdraw forces</a> from the Lebanese side of the border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators in Israel last month calling for a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The United Nations resolution that ended that war and underpinned the cease-fire was meant to distance Hezbollah’s forces from the border but was never properly enforced.</p><p>The United States and others are pushing for a revival of that resolution. But with the Lebanese Army and U.N. peacekeepers having proved ineffective over the years, Mr. Amidror said this time Israel would have to enforce it. Analysts said, however, that Israel’s military successes might also give it some leverage to demand better conditions.</p><p>Israel’s air superiority over Lebanon has long been known, said David Wood, a senior analyst in Lebanon for the International Crisis Group. “What’s become clear,” he added, “is its willingness to use it.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Wood and other analysts said, Hezbollah, with its vast remaining arsenal, continues to present a significant challenge to Israel.</p><p>In a speech days before his death, Mr. Nasrallah said that his fighters would have the advantage if Israeli ground forces crossed the border and came to them.
