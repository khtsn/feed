    <h1>Trump Issues ‘Last Warning’ to Hamas to Release Israeli Hostages</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Israeli government has said that about 25 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others are still in Gaza. Mr. Trump, who has directed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-hostages-inauguration.html" title="">strong threats</a> at their captors before, said the militants were “sick and twisted” for keeping bodies.</p><p>“I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,” Mr. Trump wrote.</p><p>“This is your last warning,” he went on, adding that if the group continued to hold hostages, “you are DEAD!”</p><p>Hamas said in a post on the Telegram app that Mr. Trump’s statement would complicate efforts to negotiate the second phase of its cease-fire agreement with Israel, and would make it easier for the Israeli government not to meet its obligations under the deal. Israel and Hamas are at a deadlock over the second phase, which aims to reach a comprehensive truce that would end the war and free the remaining living hostages.</p><p>Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups seized around 250 hostages during the deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that set off the war in Gaza. The Palestinian authorities say more than 45,000 Gazans have been killed in the conflict. Military experts say that while Israel’s military campaign has weakened Hamas, the group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-cease-fire.html" title="">still holds power in Gaza</a>.</p></div></div>
