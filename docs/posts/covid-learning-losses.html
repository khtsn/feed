    <h1>Covid Learning Losses</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Schoolchildren in Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania are still about half a year behind typical pre-Covid reading levels. In Florida and Michigan, the gap is about three-quarters of a year. In Maine, Oregon and Vermont, it is close to a full year.</p><p>This morning, a group of academic researchers released <a href="https://educationrecoveryscorecard.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their latest report card</a> on pandemic learning loss, and it shows a disappointingly slow recovery in almost every state. School closures during Covid set children back, and most districts have not been able to make up the lost ground.</p><p>One reason is a rise in school absences that has continued long after Covid stopped dominating daily life. “The pandemic may have been the earthquake, but heightened absenteeism is the tsunami and it’s still rolling through schools,” Thomas Kane, a Harvard economist and a member of the research team, told me.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, I will walk through four points from the report, with charts created by my colleague Ashley Wu. I’ll also tell you the researchers’ recommendations for what schools should do now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-480870a2">1. State variation</h2><p>The new report — from scholars at Dartmouth, Harvard and Stanford — compares performance across states, based on math and reading tests that fourth and eighth graders take. (A separate report, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/reading-skills-naep.html" title="">on national trends</a>, came out last month.)</p><p>Today’s report shows a wide variety of outcomes. In the states that have made up the most ground, fourth and eighth graders were doing nearly as well last spring as their predecessors were doing five years earlier.</p><p>But the overall picture is not good. In a typical state, students last spring were still about half a year behind where their predecessors were in 2019. In a few states, the gap approaches a full year.</p><p>Here are the changes in reading performance:</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-137a4191">2. A blue-red divide</h2><p>Political leaders in red and blue America made different decisions during the pandemic. Many public schools in heavily Democratic areas stayed closed for almost a year — from the spring of 2020 until the spring of 2021. In some Republican areas, by contrast, schools remained closed for only the spring of 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>This pattern helps explains a partisan gap in learning loss: Students in blue states have lost more ground since 2019. The differences are especially large in math. Eight of the 10 states that have lost the most ground since 2019 voted Democratic in recent presidential elections. And eight of the 10 states with the smallest math shortfalls voted Republican.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>I know some readers may wonder if blue states had bigger declines simply because they started from a higher point. After all, the states with the best reading and math scores have long been mostly blue. But that doesn’t explain the post-pandemic patterns. For example, New Jersey (a blue state) and Utah (a red state) both had high math scores in 2019, but New Jersey has fared much worse since then.</p><h2 id="link-343c9dcc">3. More inequality</h2><p>Pandemic learning loss has exacerbated class gaps and racial gaps. Lower-income students are even further behind upper-income students than they were five years ago, and Black students and Latino students are even further behind Asian and white students. “Children, especially poor children, are paying the price for the pandemic,” Kane said.</p><p>Other research, by Rebecca Jack of the University of Nebraska and Emily Oster of Brown, points to <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.37.4.51" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two core reasons</a>. First, schools with a large number of poor students and Black or Latino students were more likely to remain closed for long periods of time. Second, a day of missed school tends to have a larger effect on disadvantaged students than others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the years before Covid, the U.S. education system had impressive success in reducing learning inequality, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/briefing/school-education-gaps-funding-math.html" title="">as I explained in a 2022 newsletter</a>. But Covid erased much of that progress. “Educational inequality grew during the pandemic and remains larger now than in 2019,” Sean Reardon, a Stanford sociologist and co-author of the new report, said.</p><h2 id="link-485bcbc7">4. How to recover</h2><p>The authors of the report note that some school districts, including in poorer areas, have largely recovered from Covid learning loss. Among the standouts are Compton, Calif.; Ector County, Texas, which includes Odessa; Union City, N.J.; and Rapides Parish, La. The authors urge more study of these districts to understand what they’re doing right.</p><p>Early evidence suggests that after-school tutoring and summer school, subsidized by federal aid, made a difference. Intensive efforts to reduce absenteeism can also help.</p><p>One problem, the authors write, is that many schools have not been honest with parents about learning loss: “Since early in the recovery, the overwhelming majority of parents have been under the false impression that their children were unaffected.”</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-21861e96">Trump’s Executive Power</h2><ul><li><p>A federal judge said that the White House had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/trump-unfreezing-federal-grants-judge-ruling.html" title="">defied his order</a> to unfreeze billions of dollars in federal grants. The ruling sets up a power struggle between the judicial and executive branches.</p></li><li><p>Many of President Trump’s orders seem to violate laws.
