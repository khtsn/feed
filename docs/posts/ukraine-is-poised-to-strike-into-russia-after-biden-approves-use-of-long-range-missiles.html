The addition of up to 10,000 North Korean troops to Moscow’s war effort this fall has alarmed the United States and European nations, who view it as widening the war by drawing Russian allies directly into the ground combat.</p><p>The North Korean presence appeared to be what persuaded the White House to shift its stance on long-range missiles after months of resistance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky, in his nightly address to the nation on Sunday, suggested there would be no warning of the first launches.</p><p>“Blows are not inflicted with words,” he said. “Such things are not announced. The rockets will speak for themselves.”</p><p>The shift by the Biden administration may clear the way for Britain and France to provide similar weapons for Ukraine to use for strikes into Russia.</p><p>In Moscow on Monday, the Kremlin said the Biden administration’s decision to allow Ukrainian forces to strike targets in Russia was a major step toward a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“This escalates tensions to a qualitatively new level,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters. He accused the Biden Administration of “continuing to add oil to the fire and provoking the buildup of tensions around this conflict.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian soldiers firing an American-made multiple launch rocket system, or MLRS, toward Russian positions in eastern Ukraine in March 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The shift in the White House stance will allow Ukraine to use <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/europe/what-are-atacms-missiles-ukraine-russia.html" title="">a ballistic missile system called ATACMS</a> (pronounced “attack ’ems”), an abbreviation for Army Tactical Missile System. With a range of 190 miles, these missiles would allow Ukraine to strike military targets that it says would degrade Russia’s military, such as garrisons, logistical hubs and munitions depots that are beyond the reach of its artillery and shorter-range rockets.</p><p>The policy shift comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">months of bleak military setbacks</a> for Ukraine along the front line. Short of troops, Ukraine has resorted to shifting soldiers to reinforce hot spots, leaving the areas they vacated vulnerable. Russia has advanced as much as a mile a day in the southern Donetsk region, its fastest pace since early in the war.</p><p>Away from the front, Russia has pummeled Ukrainian military and civilian targets with near nightly drone and missile barrages. In a daylight attack on Monday afternoon, a Russian ballistic missile hit a residential building in Odesa, setting it alight and killing at least eight people, local authorities said.</p><p>An attack Sunday night on the northeastern city of Sumy killed 11 people, including two children, and injured nearly 90 others, Ukrainian officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Biden administration agreed last year to supply several hundred ATACMS to the Ukrainians for use on Ukraine’s own territory, including the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. The Ukrainian military has since used many of these missiles in a campaign of strikes on military targets in Crimea and it is unclear how many remain in Ukraine’s arsenal.</p><p>But Ukraine remained frustrated for months by the White House’s refusal to grant permission for longer-range strikes into Russian territory.</p><p>American officials and military analysts have said that firing a limited number of ballistic missiles at targets in Russia would not significantly impact the dynamics of the war but could quickly help troops facing the offensive in the Kursk region.</p><p>The Ukrainians could use the missiles to hit North Korean troops as a way of discouraging Pyongyang from sending more; that appeared to be one of the main reasons for the White House’s shifting position.</p><p>A brigade commander fighting in Kursk said Monday that he thought the ATACMS could help Ukraine strike logistical hubs, ammunition depots, key pieces of equipment and supply lines supporting the attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A residential building in Luhansk, in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine, that was damaged in June by U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The question is how many of them we have and what the supply of these munitions will look like,” the commander said by telephone, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to publicly discuss military operations. Much would depend, he said, on the Ukrainian military intelligence agency’s ability to find North Korean troop concentrations and other targets on Russian territory.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research organization, released <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8b060c46ee6f49908f9fb415ad23051c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interactive map</a> this summer plotting 225 military installations within the range of ATACMS, including missile brigades, storage facilities, radar installations, airfields used to stage attack helicopters, repair depots, ammunition warehouses and logistics hubs.</p><p>A Ukrainian official familiar with the negotiations between Kyiv and Washington said Ukraine had been waiting and fighting for this decision for over a year. “We’ve always simply said that the greater our long-range capabilities, the faster we will defend Ukraine and end this war,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.</p><p>In his comments to reporters on Monday, Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, referred to statements made by President Vladimir V. Putin <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/trips/75099" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in September</a>, saying that permission for longer-range strikes would constitute evidence that the West was escalating its showdown with Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ukraine could only use such long-range systems, he said, with the help of NATO personnel and satellite guidance. In effect, he argued, that would turn those countries into participants in the war.</p><p>“This will mean that NATO countries — the United States and European countries — are at war with Russia,” he said during a government meeting in St. Petersburg.</p><p>On Sunday, pro-Kremlin commentators interpreted the ATACMS policy change as an attempt by the outgoing Biden administration to reduce negotiating options for President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has pledged to bring about a quick end to the war, without saying how.</p><p>“The Biden administration must surely understand that it is leaving Trump’s team not only the problem of solving the Ukrainian conflict, but an even bigger one: prevention of a global standoff,” said Leonid Slutsky, the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian firefighters battling a blaze at an apartment building after a Russian bombardment in Kharkiv, Ukraine, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Throughout the war, Russia has been able to strike every corner of Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has estimated that Russia has fired more than 25,000 long-range munitions such as missiles and exploding drones over the course of the war. The Kremlin has bolstered its vast arsenal with drones and missiles provided by Iran and North Korea.</p><p>The Pentagon had previously given three reasons for withholding permission to use ATACMS to strike inside Russia: a concern that Russia would escalate hostilities by increasing its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/europe/russia-plot-dhl-planes.html" title="">covert campaign</a> against Ukraine’s Western allies; a lack of sufficient stockpiles of the missiles; and the contention that the Russians had moved their most valuable military assets out of range.</p><p>On the last point, the Ukrainians and military analysts said that even if Russia had moved some of its most valuable bombers and fighter jets, there were still strategically important targets ATACMS could hit.</p><p>As Ukraine pressed Washington to allow it to provide and use Western weapons to strike back, it has been busily working to expand its own arms industry.</p><p>Ukraine has gradually built up its long-range strike capabilities, and now regularly employs drones capable of hitting targets more than 600 miles beyond the Russian border.</p><p>The most dramatic demonstration of the impact this type of campaign can have came when Ukraine struck two large ammunition depots in Russian towns about 200 miles from the border with its own drones, setting ablaze over 30,000 tons of ammunition, according to Western military officials and military analysts who studied video and satellite footage in the aftermath of the strikes.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
