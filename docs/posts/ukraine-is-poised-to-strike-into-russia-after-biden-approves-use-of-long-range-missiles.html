Trump to the White House in January. It is unclear how much of the Biden administration’s approach to Ukraine will survive once Mr. Trump takes office, including this most recent shift.</p><p>Mr. Trump has been skeptical of continuing American aid to Ukraine and has said he wants to bring about a quick resolution to the war — without saying how.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The impact may be more political, albeit with a narrowing window of opportunity,” said Matthew Savill, the military sciences director for the Royal United Services Institute, a British defense research organization. “The Ukrainians need to convince the incoming U.S. administration that they are still worth backing — in President Trump’s transactional view, a ‘good investment.’”</p><p>American officials said the missiles were likely to be deployed, at least initially, against combined Russian and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/europe/north-korean-troops-arrive-kursk-russia.html" title="">North Korean troops</a> in territory Ukraine has captured in the Kursk region of southern Russia. Ukraine invaded Kursk in part to take control of Russian land it could use as leverage in peace talks. It could deploy American missiles for longer-range strikes to try to safeguard its position ahead of any negotiations Mr. Trump might push for.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, speaking in his nightly address to the nation on Sunday, suggested there would be no warning of the first launches.</p><p>“Blows are not inflicted with words,” he said. “Such things are not announced. The rockets will speak for themselves. They certainly will.”</p><p>In Moscow on Monday, the Kremlin said the Biden administration’s decision was a major step toward a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“This escalates tensions to a qualitatively new level,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters. He accused the Biden administration of “continuing to add oil to the fire and provoking the buildup of tensions.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian soldiers firing an American-made multiple launch rocket system toward Russian positions in eastern Ukraine in March 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>American officials and analysts said they did not expect the policy shift to substantially alter the course of the war, and pro-Kremlin commentators called the change a political decision aimed at reducing negotiating options for Mr. Trump.</p><p>“The Biden administration must surely understand that it is leaving Trump’s team not only the problem of solving the Ukrainian conflict, but an even bigger one: prevention of a global standoff,” said Leonid Slutsky, the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., sharply criticized the shift in policy. “The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,” he wrote <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1858242971373637784" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a post on X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The shift in the White House stance will allow Ukraine to use <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/europe/what-are-atacms-missiles-ukraine-russia.html" title="">a ballistic missile system called ATACMS</a> (pronounced “attack ’ems”), an abbreviation for Army Tactical Missile System. With a range of 190 miles, these missiles would allow Ukraine to strike targets that it says would degrade Russia’s military, such as garrisons, logistical hubs and munitions depots, that are beyond the reach of its artillery and shorter-range rockets.</p><p>The administration’s decision may clear the way for Britain and France to provide similar weapons for strikes into Russia.</p><p>The permission comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">months of bleak military setbacks</a> for Ukraine along the front line. Short of troops, Ukraine has resorted to shifting soldiers to reinforce hot spots, leaving the areas they vacated vulnerable. Russia has advanced as much as a mile a day in the southern Donetsk region, its fastest pace since early in the war.</p><p>Away from the front, Russia has pummeled Ukrainian military and civilian targets with near nightly drone and missile barrages. In a daylight attack on Monday afternoon, a Russian ballistic missile hit a residential neighborhood in Odesa, setting a building alight and killing at least 10 people and wounding another 43, local authorities said.</p><p>An attack Sunday night on the northeastern city of Sumy killed 11 people, including two children, and injured nearly 90 others, Ukrainian officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Biden administration agreed last year to supply several hundred ATACMS to Ukraine for use on Ukrainian territory, including the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. The Ukrainian military has since used many of these missiles in a campaign of strikes on military targets in Crimea and it is unclear how many remain in its arsenal.</p><p>But Ukraine remained frustrated for months by the White House’s refusal to grant permission for longer-range strikes into Russian territory.</p><p>The addition of up to 10,000 North Korean troops to Moscow’s war effort this fall appeared to be what persuaded the White House to shift its stance. Their arrival alarmed the United States and European nations, who view it as widening the war by drawing Russian allies directly into the ground combat.</p><p>Hitting North Korean troops could discourage Pyongyang from sending more forces to Russia.</p><p>Ukrainian troops have held several hundred square miles of territory in the Kursk region for more than three months since launching an offensive this summer. Russia has clawed back some of this terrain and is now attacking with a force of about 50,000 troops, according to American estimates. Ukraine claims to have repelled the first waves of this assault, destroying dozens of armored vehicles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>A brigade commander fighting in Kursk said on Monday that he thought the ATACMS could help Ukraine strike logistical hubs, ammunition depots, key pieces of equipment and supply lines supporting the attack.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A residential building in Luhansk, in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine, that was damaged in June by U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The question is how many of them we have and what the supply of these munitions will look like,” the commander said by telephone, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to publicly discuss military operations. </p><p>Much would depend, he said, on the Ukrainian military intelligence agency’s ability to find the location of North Korean troop concentrations and other targets.</p><p>Some Ukrainians said the move came better late than never, but lamented the delay.</p><p>“It’s a pity it took 1,000 days and thousands of Ukrainian lives to make this decision,” said Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of Parliament in the opposition European Solidarity party. “But it is an important decision, and we are thankful.”</p><p>A Ukrainian official familiar with the negotiations between Kyiv and Washington said Ukraine had been waiting and fighting for the decision for over a year. “We’ve always simply said that the greater our long-range capabilities, the faster we will defend Ukraine and end this war,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In his comments to reporters on Monday, Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, referred to statements made by President Vladimir V.

Ukraine’s military has estimated that Russia has fired more than 25,000 long-range munitions such as missiles and exploding drones over the course of the war. The Kremlin has bolstered its vast arsenal with drones and missiles provided by Iran and North Korea.</p><p>“The Russian Army is targeting civilians every day,” said Maria Mezentseva, a member of Parliament from Kharkiv, a city frequently hit by Russian missiles. She described the decision to grant permission for long-range strikes as “a fair thing to do.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The Pentagon had previously given three reasons for withholding permission to use ATACMS to strike inside Russia: a concern that Russia would escalate hostilities by increasing its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/europe/russia-plot-dhl-planes.html" title="">covert campaign</a> against Ukraine’s Western allies; a lack of sufficient stockpiles of the missiles; and the contention that the Russians had moved their most valuable military assets out of range.</p><p>On the last point, the Ukrainians and military analysts said that even if Russia had moved some of its most valuable bombers and fighter jets, there were still strategically important targets ATACMS could hit.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
