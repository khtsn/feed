It spent $22.6 billion on capital expenses, almost twice as much as a year earlier.</p><p>Microsoft has said it would spend around $80 billion in data centers this fiscal year, which ends in June. It is sprinting because it has said it does not have enough capacity to meet customer demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing services.</p><p>That spending came against the backdrop of solid overall growth in both profits and revenue for the tech giant. Revenue hit $69.6 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Profit rose 10 percent, to $24.1 billion. The results beat Wall Street’s expectations and Microsoft’s own predictions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“As A.I. becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said in a call with investors.</p><p>The questions about A.I. spending among big technology companies grew more urgent after a Chinese start-up, DeepSeek, startled Wall Street this week with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/technology/what-is-deepseek-china-ai.html" title="">an advanced A.I. system the company said was developed</a> for a fraction of the power and costs than leading tech firms had spent.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
