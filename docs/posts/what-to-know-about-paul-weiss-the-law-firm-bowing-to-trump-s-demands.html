Its work involves mergers and acquisitions, private equity, white-collar and regulatory defense and litigation. Clients have included corporations like ExxonMobil, Citigroup, Imagine Entertainment and Lucasfilm.</p><p>Paul Weiss’s revenue was more than $2.6 billion last year, according to Law360. The firm also has a large pro bono practice of public service work, some of which will now be performed for causes championed by President Trump, according to the deal.</p><p>The president had issued an executive order, part of a broader campaign against law firms, which would have suspended Paul Weiss’s security clearances and barred its lawyers from federal buildings. To persuade the president to lift the order, the firm agreed to do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/business/paul-weiss-memo-trump-deal.html" title="">$40 million worth of pro bono work on causes</a>, such as working with veterans and fighting antisemitism, over the course of Mr. Trump’s term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the deal with Mr. Trump has led some critics to charge that Paul Weiss betrayed its principles by giving in to the president rather than fighting him in court.</p><p>The firm is known for giving a home to prominent Democrats, like Theodore C. Sorensen, who was an adviser to President John F. Kennedy.</p><p>Among its current partners are Loretta E. Lynch, who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama; Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York under President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; and Jeh C. Johnson, a former secretary of homeland security under Mr. Obama.</p><p>The firm set up shop in 1875 at 243 Broadway, initially representing merchant and investment banking houses, real estate developers, oil and railroad interests and other clients, according to the Paul Weiss website.</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, when law firms in New York were beginning to expand, Paul Weiss was one of the few large firms that would hire and promote Jewish law school graduates, said Eli Wald, a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“During this discriminatory era, Paul Weiss emerged and grew as a mixed law firm, a coming together of Jewish and non-Jewish lawyers to form a more welcoming and diverse large law firm,” he said.</p><p>Among the law firm’s principles, which are posted on its website, is one that says “We believe in maintaining, by affirmative efforts, a membership of partners and associates reflecting a wide variety of religious, political, ethnic and social backgrounds, characteristic of that community.”</p><p>Paul Weiss’s chairman, Brad Karp, emailed the law firm on Thursday evening, seeking to reassure its lawyers and other employees that the deal reached with Mr. Trump “reaffirmed” the firm’s long held principles.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.paulweiss.com/about-the-firm/principles" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principles</a>, dating to 1963, are credited to one of the firm’s original named partners, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/15/nyregion/simon-rifkind-celebrated-lawyer-dies-at-94.html" title="">Judge Simon H. Rifkind</a>, a renowned trial lawyer who had also served on the federal bench in the Southern District of New York; he died in 1995.</p><p>Another precept is to act “as members of a free democratic society with responsibilities both to our profession and our country.”</p><p>Alain Delaquérière<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison">Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>DOGE:</strong> Top Senate Democrats asked the internal watchdogs of more than a dozen government agencies to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/doge-cuts-senate-democrats.html">investigate job cuts</a> carried out at the direction of Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency operation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Top-Secret China War Plans:</strong> Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/trump-china-elon-musk-pentagon.html">rejected the notion that Musk should be given access</a> to the plans for a potential military conflict with China, even as he denied a report that such a briefing had been planned to be held at the Pentagon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Law Firm Bends:</strong> The deal between Paul Weiss and the White House was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/business/paul-weiss-memo-trump-deal.html">causing concern among the broader legal community</a> that large law firms were capitulating to President Trump’s demands instead of fighting them in court.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jan. 6 Lawsuits: </strong>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/jan-6-lawsuits.html">made an unusual effort to short-circuit a series of civil lawsuits</a> seeking to hold Trump accountable for his supporters’ attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p></li><li><p><strong>Government Science Data:</strong> Vast quantities of climate and environmental information have been removed from official websites in the past months. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/climate/government-websites-climate-environment-data.html">Scientists are trying keep it available</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Campus Free Speech:</strong> Trump and state politicians are pushing new laws and policies that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/republicans-trump-free-speech-campuses.html">crack down on curriculum, protests and speakers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attacks on Houthi Targets:</strong> The U.S. military continued a wave of attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen as part of what American officials said was an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/middleeast/trump-houthis-yemen-strikes.html">effort to stop the militant group’s attacks</a> on commercial ships in the Red Sea.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
