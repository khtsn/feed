    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><div id="top-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-top">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p><div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Kamala Harris hit the road today for campaign events in the three battleground states that make up her clearest possible path to victory: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. In each state, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/politics/harris-liz-cheney-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin.html" title="">Harris is holding sit-down discussions with the former congresswoman Liz Cheney</a>, her most prominent conservative surrogate.</p><p>With just over two weeks before Election Day, the appearances are designed to appeal to the tiny fraction of voters who could prove decisive in a race that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/upshot/trump-harris-polls-election.html" title="">our chief political analyst Nate Cohn says can hardly get any closer</a>. The Harris team hopes the events will help them attract moderate, suburban, Republican women, a demographic her campaign believes can be cleaved away from Donald Trump in sufficient numbers to win key states.</p><p>Harris has been able to spend more time with voters, and less with donors, because her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/elections/harris-trump-campaign-finance.html" title="">fund-raising efforts have broken records</a>. Behind the scenes, the Harris and Trump campaigns have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/politics/trump-harris-undecided-voters.html" title="">dug through data</a> to find the last remaining undecided voters. They both think many are younger, Black or Latino, and the Harris team is also eyeing white, college-educated women.</p><h2 id="link-4291416d">On the campaign trail</h2><p><em>The presidential election is </em><strong><em>15 days away</em></strong><em>.</em></p><ul><li><p>Trump campaigned today in North Carolina.

(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/2024-election-questions.html" title="">Send us your questions here</a>.)</p><blockquote><p><em>Where do voters living in the nonswing states find the motivation to vote? — Marcel Schutte, the Netherlands</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Voters living in nonswing states are still casting ballots for a list of other statewide and local offices, so their votes do matter in those races. There’s also a sense of sending a political message. While New York or Texas is unlikely to change the outcome of the presidential race, shifts in party support in those states can impact the political mandate a new president has to lead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Scrapping the electoral college would require a constitutional amendment, which would face an extraordinarily — if not nearly impossible — bar to passage.
