Could the Golden Globes, taking place Sunday, Jan. 5, on CBS, bring some clarity?</p><p>There’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/movies/anora-review.html" title="">Anora</a>,” Sean Baker’s Cinderella story; “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/movies/the-brutalist-review.html" title="">The Brutalist</a>,” Brady Corbet’s postwar immigrant epic; “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/movies/conclave-review.html" title="">Conclave,</a>” Edward Berger’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/movies/conclave-memes.html" title="">much-memed drama</a> about catty cardinals; and finally Jacques Audiard’s narco musical “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/movies/emilia-perez-review.html" title="">Emilia Pérez</a>,” which leads the Golden Globes film nominees with 10 overall.</p><p>Here’s how to watch the Globes — and what to watch for.</p><h2 id="link-44b7c7f1">What time does the show start, and where can I watch?</h2><p>The ceremony begins at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif. CBS is the official television broadcaster.</p><p>Online, you can watch live on the CBS app, though you’ll need the credentials from your cable provider to sign in. The show will also stream on Paramount+, but only subscribers who have the premium Paramount+ with Showtime plan will be able to watch live. For those who do not, the ceremony can be streamed beginning Monday on Paramount+.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Some good news: Paramount+ offers seven-day free trials for new subscribers. Just remember to cancel your subscription before the end of the week to avoid being charged.</p><p>A number of live TV streaming services also offer access to CBS, including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV and FuboTV, all of which require subscriptions, though many are offering free trials.</p><h2 id="link-25c3614">Is there a red carpet?</h2><p><a href="https://variety.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Variety</a> and <a href="https://www.etonline.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Entertainment Tonight</a> will stream red carpet arrivals beginning at 6:30 p.m. Eastern, 3:30 p.m. Pacific, on their websites and social media platforms as part of the official Globes preshow. You can also watch on the <a href="https://goldenglobes.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Globes website</a>. (Penske Media Corp. owns both the Golden Globes and Variety, among other brands.)</p><h2 id="link-24763ba9">Who is hosting?</h2><p>The comedian and actress Nikki Glaser will be the ceremony’s first solo female host. Things are pretty much guaranteed to go better than last year, when the comedian Jo Koy was tapped as the night’s host just 10 days before the event and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/movies/jo-koy-golden-globes-criticism.html" title="">bombed</a>.</p><h2 id="link-70010388">Who is presenting?</h2><p>The lineup of actors, comedians and musicians who will hand out awards includes Nicolas Cage, Colman Domingo, Andrew Garfield, Demi Moore, Anya Taylor-Joy, Brandi Carlile, Elton John and Nate Bargatze.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1f938306">Who votes on the awards?</h2><p>With the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/movies/the-golden-globes-lawsuit-hollywood-foreign-press.html" title="">Hollywood Foreign Press Association</a> dissolved after several scandals, an expanded group of more than 300 entertainment journalists from 85 countries is now responsible for selecting nominees and winners. The <a href="https://goldenglobes.com/faqs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voting body</a> is not only much larger than the approximately 80-person, overwhelmingly white H.F.P.A. was, it is also more diverse.</p><h2 id="link-2eb12d43">What’s new this year?</h2><p>The Globes’ two lifetime achievement honors, the Cecil B. DeMille and Carol Burnett awards, which honor contributions to entertainment and television, won’t be handed out live at the main ceremony. The honorees, the actors Viola Davis and Ted Danson, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/golden-globes-gala-viola-davis-ted-danson-luncheon-first-time-nominees-1236243206/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will be recognized at a separate gala dinner on Friday evening</a>, with prerecorded highlights to be shown on the Globes telecast.</p><h2 id="link-986a732">Who is nominated?</h2><p>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/movies/emilia-perez-review.html" title="">Emilia Pérez</a>” is leading the pack among films, with 10 nominations, followed by “The Brutalist” (seven), “Conclave” (six) and “Anora” (five).</p><p>On the TV side, Season 3 of FX’s restaurant dramedy “The Bear” is out in front with five nominations. It’s followed by the Hulu mystery comedy “Only Murders in the Building” and FX’s “Shogun,” each of which picked up four nominations.</p><p>If you’re just here for the outfits, good news: Fashion-forward stars like Colman Domingo (“Sing Sing”), Timothée Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), Angelina Jolie (“Maria”), Zendaya (“Challengers”), and the “Wicked” co-stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are likely to be on hand.</p><h2 id="link-6255615">What should you watch for?</h2><p>Karla Sofía Gascón, a star of “Emilia Pérez,” could become the first transgender actress to win a Globe for a film performance. (She would be the second transgender actress winner after Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, who took home a prize for the TV drama “Pose” in 2022.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One dark horse to look out for is “The Substance,” the body-horror movie that is nominated in five categories, including best musical or comedy (<a href="https://people.com/the-substance-comedy-golden-globes-fan-reactions-8734006" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">do not ask us to explain this categorization</a>).</p><p>Among television nominees, look for “Shogun” to clean up in the drama categories. Strong showings are also predicted for the Max comedy “Hacks” and its star Jean Smart as well as Richard Gadd’s Netflix stalker drama, “Baby Reindeer.”</p><h2 id="link-7a3af81f">How often do the Globes and Oscars best picture winners overlap?</h2><p>Given that the Globes give out two top awards to films each year — for best drama and best musical or comedy — you would think they would overlap a lot more often than they do.</p><p>But the Globes winner in either category has gone on to win best picture at the Oscars in only four of the past 10 years.</p><h2 id="link-1929948c">I just need a fun fact to make conversation with at my watch party.</h2><p>The Globes statuettes are <a href="https://en.as.com/latest_news/what-is-a-golden-globe-made-of-what-is-its-size-and-how-much-does-it-weight-n/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surprisingly heavy</a>: Each one tips the scales at 7.8 pounds. (A gallon of milk, for comparison, clocks in at 8.6 pounds.)</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Sarah Bahr writes about culture and style for The Times.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
