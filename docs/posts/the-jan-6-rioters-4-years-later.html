    <h1>The Jan. 6 Rioters, 4 Years Later</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In the past four years, nearly 1,600 people have been prosecuted in connection with the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Some were accused of felonies like assault or seditious conspiracy and are still in prison. But hundreds charged with lesser crimes have wrapped up their cases and returned to their lives.</p><p>Jan. 6 was a turning point for everyone involved. In breaching the Capitol, a mob of Trump loyalists caused millions of dollars in damage, injured more than 140 police officers and, for the first time in American history, chased lawmakers away from their duty to certify a presidential election.</p><p>The attack also prompted the largest single investigation the Justice Department has ever undertaken, leading to arrests in all 50 states. Ever since, the defendants have been held to account in Washington’s federal courthouse, blocks away from the Capitol itself, for their roles in undermining a bedrock of democracy, the peaceful transfer of power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/23/us/politics/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/23/us/politics/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/23/us/politics/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/23/us/politics/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/23/us/politics/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/23/us/politics/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new-jumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/23/us/politics/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new/00dc-jan6-defendants-2new-superJumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/4b443a9e-cfaa-57d9-884f-38801735d4ca" decoding="async" width="600" height="600"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of Donald J.

At best, they say they have seen the realities of the criminal justice system, becoming more sympathetic to the plights of others facing prosecution. At worst, they remain convinced that the system treated them unfairly, hardened by their brushes with the law.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The judges who have overseen Capitol riot cases have routinely pushed back on that idea.</p><p>“I have been shocked to watch some public figures try to rewrite history, claiming rioters behaved ‘in an orderly fashion’ like ordinary tourists, or martyrizing convicted Jan. 6 defendants as ‘political prisoners’ or even, incredibly, ‘hostages,’” Judge Royce C. Lamberth, a Reagan appointee, said in court last year. “That is all preposterous.”</p><p>Still, President-elect Donald J. Trump has promised to pardon many, maybe most, of the rioters as soon as he takes office and could shut down the broad investigation into the Capitol attack. Here are the experiences of some defendants accused of relatively minor crimes four years after Jan. 6.</p><h2 id="link-5cb6483b">Eric Clark</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Kasnic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On Jan. 6, Eric Clark was three years sober and had more or less settled into a middle-class life as a machine operator in Louisville, Ky., after years of battling homelessness and drug addiction.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the belief that Mr. Trump won the 2020 election led him to illegally enter the Capitol in a Guy Fawkes mask and refuse to leave for nearly 30 minutes. Mr. Clark was sentenced to five months in prison. Now 48, he is working on a drywall cleanup crew, trying to put his life back together.</p><p>His one great success, he said, is the relationship he has rebuilt with his daughter — even though it was she who turned him in to the authorities to begin with.</p><p>“Instead of being mad at her,” he said, “I’ve chosen to accept that she has her viewpoint and I have mine.”</p><h2 id="link-7dce286c">Jacob Chansley</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Few people are more visibly associated with the Capitol attack than Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, who entered the building in face paint and a horned headdress while brandishing an American flag on a spear-tipped flagpole.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Moving with the first wave of rioters, he left a threatening note on the Senate floor for Vice President Mike Pence, who had to be hustled to safety as the mob overwhelmed the Capitol.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Chansley in the Capitol on Jan. 6.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Yet, like others who disrupted the election certification that day, Mr. Chansley seeks to cast the 41-month sentence he received as “experiencing tyranny firsthand.” Even after his release, he maintains Jan. 6 was “a setup” by the government and that public officials and the news media have painted him as a “villain and a terrorist.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Chansley, 37, said his day-to-day life in Phoenix creating art remains much the same as before that day — “other than I get more interviews now.”</p><h2 id="link-3a7a5454">Daniel Christmann</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Daniel Christmann was 38 when he was arrested on misdemeanor charges after entering the Capitol on Jan. 6 through a broken window. At the time, Mr. Christmann, who lives in New York City, had worked as a plumber and an activist journalist and had run for public office in New York.</p><p>Working with his defense lawyers during his prosecution so inspired him that he returned to school after serving his 25-day sentence. He expects to graduate in May from St. Joseph’s College in Brooklyn. And now, at 42, he is applying to law school and wants to be a lawyer who can battle what he sees as the excesses of the government — not unlike the federal defender who first came to his aid, he said.</p><p>“I just felt like what went on in my case was so bizarre and unjust that I knew we needed more fighters like her,” Mr. Christmann said.</p><h2 id="link-292f2f6a">Casey Cusick</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">September Dawn Bottoms for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Casey Cusick didn’t know much about the federal criminal justice system before he was convicted at trial of four misdemeanors for unlawfully entering the Capitol. But Mr. Cusick, a 39-year-old car dealer from Tulsa, Okla., says he now understands a little more about the cost of being held to account for his role in an attack that prosecutors say “threatened the peaceful transfer of power.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>He lost his small business as a handyman after his case was featured on the local news. And, he says, he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees.</p><p>Mr. Cusick also said he remained shocked by the harsh realities that accompany facing federal charges — everything from giving up his firearm and his passport when his case first started to the conditions of the prison where he served his 10-day sentence.</p><p>“It changed my mind forever about the criminal justice system,” he said. “I’ll never look at the term ‘prisoner’ the same again.”</p><h2 id="link-265126f0">Couy Griffin</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Hamel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Not much in Couy Griffin’s life is the same as it was before he was found guilty of illegally climbing over walls in the restricted grounds of the Capitol and sentenced to 14 days in prison.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He used to own a restaurant. Now, he says, he repairs golf carts. He once served as a commissioner in Otero County, N.M., but two years ago, he was removed from office under the 14th Amendment. That made him the first public official in more than a century to be barred from serving under a constitutional ban on insurrectionists holding office.</p><p>Still, his enthusiasm for Mr. Trump remains undimmed.</p><p>“It’s been difficult,” he said. “But I believe that the people who support me and know me, their support has only grown stronger.”</p><h2 id="link-7805cad0">Jenna Ryan</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Desiree Rios for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Jenna Ryan was a real estate broker and social media influencer in the Dallas area when she entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, praying and chanting “Fight for Trump!” with a crowd in the Rotunda.</p><p>The next day, she posted a message on Twitter, saying: “We just stormed the Capitol. It was one of the best days of my life.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>All of that ultimately led to a 60-day prison term. She claims that she was treated harshly because of her “public profile” as a Jan. 6 defendant. But being sentenced for illegally demonstrating in the Capitol also allowed her to fulfill what she describes as her “lifelong goal of being a writer and a speaker.”</p><p>Ms. Ryan, 54, has written a book called “Storming the Capitol: My Truth About January 6th,” which she says “shows how it feels to be caught in the middle of a polarized political climate, canceled by society, surveilled by the F.B.I. and thrown in prison for a tweet.”</p><h2 id="link-72fb59b9">Treniss Evans</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Lee for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Treniss Evans said he wasn’t all that interested in politics before the 2020 election. But he has become steeped in the subject since Jan. 6, when he stepped through a broken window at the Capitol and used a megaphone to lead other rioters in the Pledge of Allegiance and “The Star-Spangled Banner.”</p><p>Mr. Evans, who is 50 and lives near San Antonio, was sentenced to 20 days in prison after pleading guilty to entering the Capitol’s restricted grounds. Like other rioters, he emerged from the experience focused less on his own culpability than on the larger travails of being subject to criminal prosecution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><p>In the past four years, he has spent much of his time on a group he founded, Condemned USA, which provides legal support and public advocacy to hundreds of others who took part in the Capitol attack.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The megaphone Treniss Evans used on Jan. 6.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Lee for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>“I used to believe in our judicial system,” he said, “but now I see what generations upon generations of minorities and people of lower income have been complaining about.”</p><h2 id="link-11754bd0">James Beeks</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-36"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zack Wittman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><p>When James Beeks went to Washington on Jan. 6 with the Oath Keepers militia, his chosen profession distinguished him from many of his compatriots in the far-right organization, which played a central role in breaching the Capitol.
