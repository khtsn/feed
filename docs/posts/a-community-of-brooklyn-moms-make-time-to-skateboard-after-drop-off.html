Although she’s familiar with board-based sports as a longtime snowboarder, she stopped skateboarding in her 20s. She picked it up again with her daughter’s help a few years ago.</p><p>“She was really proud of me for trying new things,” Ms. Landfield said. “And I think that made me feel I’m like giving them a good example that you can try anything, no matter how old you are.”</p><p>Ms. Noelliste, 39, who owns BGLH Marketplace, a <a href="https://bglh-marketplace.com/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">skin care business</a>, was going through a divorce and took up surfing as a hobby in 2020.
