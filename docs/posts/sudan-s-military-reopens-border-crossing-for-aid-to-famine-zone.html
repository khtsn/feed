U.N. and aid groups, caught unaware, welcomed the decision, with one U.N. official saying it could make a “significant difference” to relief efforts. But those providing aid were also seeking clarification from the Sudanese authorities about any potential restrictions.</p></div></div><div><p>The sudden decision followed weeks of growing international criticism of Sudan’s military for the border closure. It also coincided with the start of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/africa/sudan-civil-war-ceasefire-talks-geneva.html" title="">American-led effort to revive peace talks</a> in Switzerland aimed at halting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/briefing/sudan-civil-war.html" title="">the civil war ripping apart</a> one of Africa’s biggest countries.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed tank in Omdurman, Sudan, in April.

Across the country at least 26 million people, over half Sudan’s population, are in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/world/africa/sudan-famine-starvation.html" title="">a food crisis</a>, the world’s leading body of hunger experts estimates.</p><p>At the United Nations Security Council last week, James Kariuki, Britain’s deputy permanent U.N. representative, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/there-is-famine-in-sudan-and-that-famine-is-entirely-man-made-uk-statement-at-the-un-security-council#:~:text=Statement%20by%20Ambassador%20James%20Kariuki,Security%20Council%20meeting%20on%20Sudan.&amp;text=There%20is%20only%20one%20possible,famine%20is%20entirely%20man%2Dmade" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused the Sudanese military of obstructing aid</a> by shutting the Adré crossing, which he called “the most direct route to deliver assistance at scale.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>At least 100 people are dying from hunger every day in Sudan, Mr. Kariuki added, calling the famine “entirely man-made.”</p><p>Aid workers and U.N. officials in Adré repeated those assessments during a visit by a New York Times reporter and a photographer last month. Nearly 200,000 people are crammed into a crowded camp around the city. But U.N. aid trucks were forbidden from driving into Sudan because of the shuttered border.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Rapid Support Forces, which controls most of Darfur, has also been accused by rights groups and American officials of obstructing humanitarian aid and using starvation as a weapon of war. Since the war started in April 2023, R.S.F. fighters have attacked aid convoys and burned a factory that makes baby food, officials say.</p><p>Adré is key to scaling up aid deliveries because it offers relatively easy access to the parts of Darfur where the hunger crisis is greatest. Until February, aid trucks filled with food could easily cross.</p></div></div><div><div><p>After the Sudanese military closed the crossing in February, it directed the United Nations to send its trucks through Tine, Chad, a remote crossing 150 miles by road to the north. But that alternative route proved slow, expensive and dangerous, allowing just a fraction of the needed aid to get through.</p><p>And then Tine closed entirely in recent weeks as heavy seasonal rains made local roads impassable. </p><p>Sudanese commentators said the military may have reopened the border to direct attention away from its refusal to attend the American-led peace talks in Geneva, which the R.S.F. is attending.</p><p>The military’s decision will increase pressure on the international aid community to do more for Sudan at a time when money is scarce. The United States, which gives more than any country, announced <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/jul-18-2024-united-states-announces-nearly-203-million-humanitarian-assistance-people-sudan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another $204 million</a> for Sudan last month.</p><p>But the United Nations <a href="https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says it has received</a> just $1 billion of the $2.7 billion it needs to deal with the growing famine.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nearly 200,000 people who have fled the violence and starvation in Darfur are crammed into the refugee camp in Adré. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Declan Walsh is the chief Africa correspondent for The Times based in Nairobi, Kenya.
