    <h1>Trump’s Tariffs Would Deal a Big Blow to the Auto Industry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mexico and Canada are also major suppliers of components to virtually all manufacturers including Tesla, whose chief executive, Elon Musk, was a big supporter of Mr. Trump’s campaign and is expected to play a significant role in his administration.</p><p>Mr. Trump said tariffs would remain in place until Mexico stops the flow of illicit drugs and unauthorized immigrants to the United States. But tariffs could lead to an increase in migration if some of the one million Mexicans who work in the auto industry lost their jobs, analysts say.</p><p>Wall Street was clearly alarmed. G.M.’s stock was down about 8 percent on Tuesday morning after Mr. Trump’s statement on tariffs. Stellantis, the owner of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler, fell about 5 percent, and Ford was down 2 percent.</p><p>Tariffs “would spell disaster for the U.S. auto industry,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note to investors. But, they added, they doubt Mr. Trump will follow through.</p><p>“Given the wide-ranging negative implications for industrial production in the U.S., we expect this is unlikely to happen in practice,” the Bernstein analysts said.</p></div></div>
