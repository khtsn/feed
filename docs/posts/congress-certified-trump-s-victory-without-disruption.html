The process was peaceful, quick and uneventful. It stood in stark contrast to this day four years ago, when the basic ritual of democracy was disrupted by a violent pro-Trump mob seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p><p>In the Capitol today, there was no hint of a similar scene, although tall, black metal fencing around the building was a reminder of the violence that had played out. Unlike Trump back then, Kamala Harris — who had the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-electoral-vote-certification.html" title="">awkward duty of presiding over the certification</a> — did not dispute her loss. And unlike Republicans four years ago, Democrats made no objections during the counting of the Electoral College votes.</p><p>Mike Pence, Trump’s former vice president who had received death threats for his role in certifying the 2020 election, praised the “return of order and civility.”</p><p>President Biden has largely focused on ensuring a smooth and orderly transition of power. But last night, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/biden-trump-warnings-jan-6.html" title="">warned Americans not to forget the violent attack</a> at the Capitol and accused Trump and his supporters of trying “to rewrite — even erase — the history of that day.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cole Burston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6cbb1b48">Trudeau said he would resign as Canada’s prime minister</h2><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada announced today that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/06/world/canada-trudeau" title="">step down as Liberal Party leader and prime minister</a>. He shut down Parliament until March 24, giving his party a few months to pick his replacement through a party election. Until then, Trudeau will remain the country’s top leader.</p><p>The resignation arrived after he faced weeks of mounting pressure from inside his own party. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/canada/justin-trudeau-canada-popularity-decline.html" title="">Once a liberal icon</a>, Trudeau has become deeply unpopular: In a recent poll, 73 percent of Canadians said he should step down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A prisoner at Guantánamo Bay’s Camp 6 detention center in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-736ca825">The U.S. released 11 Guantánamo prisoners</h2><p>The U.S. military today sent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/guantanamo-prisoners-oman.html" title="">11 Yemeni men who had been detained for two decades at Guantánamo Bay</a> to Oman. The transfer left just 15 men in the prison, fewer than at any other point since the detention center opened. Three other prisoners are eligible for transfer, including a stateless Rohingya, a Libyan and a Somali.</p><p>There were 40 detainees when President Biden took office and resurrected an Obama administration effort to close the prison. An initial plan to conduct the transfer in October 2023 was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/us/politics/guantanamo-hamas-israel-oman.html" title="">derailed by opposition from Congress</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-fd02985">New York City began its congestion pricing plan</h2><p>Today was the first weekday in which commuters entering Manhattan’s busiest streets were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/15/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-cost.html" title="">charged a $9 toll</a>.
