In school cafeterias and home kitchens, this global mix of beef is seared, fried and sizzled into millions of tacos, meatballs and lasagnas every day.</p><p>Now, President Trump’s dismantling of the global trading system through his imposition of broad-based tariffs is leading to shifts in commerce that could make winners out of countries like Brazil that produce commodities the world covets.</p><p>When it comes to beef — crucial to satisfying Americans’ hunger for cheap cuts of meat — tariffs will make Brazilian beef more expensive.</p><p>But at the same time, Brazil is suddenly a more appealing source for China, another enormous consumer of beef, because its trade war with the United States — and the high tariffs the two nations have imposed on each other — has left China looking for other countries with ample supplies of inexpensive meat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>While U.S. meatpackers, most likely anticipating escalating prices, have been stocking up on Brazilian beef in recent weeks, according to trade data, Brazilian beef exports to China also increased in April.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A herd of white cattle amid a patch of grass." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw/00int-brazil-us-beef-kgbw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/0490e418-8679-51dc-8b99-206fa2b7870d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A farm near União Bandeirantes, Brazil.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As a result, prices for commodity beef from Brazil have increased by about 20 percent since early April, trade experts say.</p><p>“The moment, from our point of view, has never been more favorable to Brazil,” said Luiz Gustavo Oliveira, the vice president of Grupo Fribal, a Brazilian meat company. “And the world has its doors open to Brazilian meat.”</p><p>U.S. meat processors, on the other hand, are struggling to grapple with higher beef prices and what they mean for their bottom lines and how much their customers will be asked to pay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a bid to keep prices down, Kent Sander, whose family owns a meat-processing business in rural Indiana, has begun mixing pork, which is less expensive, into the beef burgers he sells. “I’m trying to give people an affordable option,” he said.</p><p>Brazil is the world’s biggest exporter of beef, having surpassed the United States in the past 20 years. With vast swaths of farmland where enormous cattle herds can graze, and lower labor and other related costs, Brazilian ranchers have conquered the global market by producing beef on a larger scale and far more cheaply than its competitors.</p><p>China and the United States are the top two buyers of Brazilian beef, with both countries sharply increasing their purchases in recent years to keep up with growing domestic appetites for lean, inexpensive meat that neither country’s farmers can satisfy.</p><p>“Brazil is in a unique position,” Roberto Perosa, the president of the Brazilian Association of Meat Exporting Industries and a former trade secretary for the Brazilian government. “No other country in the world can meet this demand.”</p><p>While the United States is still the world’s biggest producer of beef, its cattle — fattened up on a soy or corn diet — is better suited for expensive, marbled steaks famous for their rich flavor, according to U.S. industry experts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Some of this cattle is slaughtered to produce cheaper cuts of beef. But a large portion is turned into premium steaks like filet mignon or rib-eye, which are consumed at home and at steakhouses, or exported to the rest of the world. China, the third-largest buyer of U.S. beef, imported $1.6 billion worth of meat in 2024.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A slaughterhouse in Porto Velh, in Rondônia State.

Now, Mr. Trump’s recent tariffs have pushed the levy to 36 percent. By comparison, Brazilian beef faces tariffs of only 12 percent in China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>With China mostly halting U.S. beef imports, supply chains for “this commodity have been completely shaken,” said André Ferreira, a Brazil-based maritime transport specialist at DMS Logistics. “So China will look at Brazil differently now.”</p><p>Some Brazilian beef producers are already charting ambitious plans for the future.</p><p>For Grupo Fribal, which raises, slaughters and packages beef for domestic and international markets, business has been booming in recent years, as exports to China and the United States have surged.</p><p>Now, the company plans to increase its cattle herd to 60,000 from 40,000 by next year, in part to take advantage of even stronger demand spurred by tariffs. “The moment is now,” said Mr. Oliveira of Grupo Fribal.</p><p>But breeding, raising and fattening more cattle for beef takes time and money, making such plans a long-term bet that demand will continue growing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Brazil, an immense nation with a mild climate favoring agriculture, has more cattle than people. Since the 1970s, both large-scale ranching and family farming have spread across every region of the country, including the Amazon rainforest.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rainforest in Brazil is routinely burned to make room for cattle grazing. Cattle ranches account for up to 80 percent of deforested land in the Amazon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor Moriyama for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Still, back-to-back droughts have taken a toll, with Brazil’s beef production expected to shrink by nearly 5 percent in 2025, according to Safras &amp; Mercado, a consultancy.</p><p>And even if some Brazilian ranchers are able to increase production in the short term, they may struggle to ship more beef abroad as major Brazilian ports are already operating near full capacity.</p><p>In the United States, trade experts say American farmers will be hard pressed to replace beef imports from Brazil and were wrestling with other challenges before the tariffs. U.S. cattle inventories have fallen to a 73-year low, partly because of drought and rising costs of animal feed.</p><p>Demand for cheaper beef is expected to increase as economic jitters pull U.S. consumers away from expensive cuts and toward burgers, pushing up prices. Ground beef prices in U.S. cities have climbed 43 percent over the past five years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Even with tariffs, the United States will most likely continue relying on Brazilian beef because there is no other similarly large source for the American market, experts said.</p><p>This may be good news for Brazil’s cattle ranchers, said Mr. Perosa, of the meat exporting association, but not for U.S. consumers. “It’s American society that will have to foot the bill,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Toyota’s Somber Outlook:</strong> The automaker’s forecast for the fiscal year underscored <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/business/toyota-earnings-trump-tariffs.html">how quickly fortunes had turned</a> for many companies reckoning with President Trump’s tariffs.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-U.K. Trade Agreement:</strong> Prime Minister Keir Starmer has spent months nurturing his relationship with Trump.
