Federal officials described the lawmakers’ presence as a “stunt.”</p><p>Mr. Baraka was allowed past the front gate but was not allowed to accompany the members of Congress inside, according to a video taken by Viri Martinez, an immigration activist who witnessed the arrest.</p><p>“Congressmen are different, congresswomen are different,” a Homeland Security Investigations agent told the mayor, the video shows. The agent added: “That is the last warning. You will be placed under arrest.”</p><p>After leaving the facility, the members of Congress joined Mr. Baraka in an area inside the front gate, according to the video.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. McIver said that Mr. Baraka then went to a public area where other protesters were gathered. “He walked himself out,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Menendez can be heard on video telling Mr. Baraka: “They’re talking about coming back to arrest you.”</p><p>The mayor replied: “I’m not on their property. They can’t come out on the street and arrest me.”</p><p>Mr. Baraka, 55, was taken into custody by a team of masked federal agents wearing military fatigues while outside the gates in a driveway swarming with protesters and reporters.</p><p>Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, called the episode a “bizarre political stunt” in a social media post. She said Ms. Watson Coleman and Mr. Menendez, along with “multiple protesters,” had “holed up in a guard shack.”</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1920938232314810627" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared a video</a> of the mayor’s arrest that she said showed a “mob” assaulting ICE agents outside the gates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man protests outside Delaney Hall after Mr. Baraka was arrested and taken to a different facility.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Fraser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“This illegal breaking and entering of a detention facility puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and the detainees at risk,” Ms. McLaughlin said, despite there being no evidence that the lawmakers had entered the building illegally.</p><p>Mr. Menendez said ICE agents had “put their hands on” Ms. Watson Coleman and Ms. McIver.</p><p>“They feel no restraint on what they should be doing, and that was shown in broad daylight today,” Mr. Menendez said at a news conference shortly after Mr. Baraka’s arrest.</p><p>Newark officials had argued for weeks in federal court that the center’s owner, GEO Group, was violating city laws because it had failed to obtain required permits or a valid certificate of occupancy.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Baraka showed up at the facility with city inspectors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/nyregion/newark-migrants-ras-baraka-ice.html" title="">at dawn</a> seeking entry. He returned on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Federal officials and a spokesman for GEO Group, one of the country’s largest private prison companies, said the mayor had ignored established processes for requesting entry. They also said the facility has all the required permits.</p><p>“The mayor has been informed that he is more than welcome to enter the facility, as long as he follows security protocols like everyone else,” Ms. McLaughlin said on Tuesday after Mr. Baraka had been denied entry.</p><p>In February, the Trump administration entered into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/nyregion/trump-deportation-facility-newark.html" title="">a 15-year, $1 billion contract with GEO Group</a> to turn Delaney Hall into a large detention center as ICE rushed to expand its detention capacity nationwide to meet the president’s mass deportation goals.</p><p>Because the facility is close to major airports, it is expected to play a central role in the agency’s efforts to increase deportation flights from the Northeast. But the building, which received its first detainees last week, quickly drew opposition from Democrats and local activists. They argued that its location near immigrant hubs in New Jersey and New York City would help accelerate the administration’s deportation pipeline.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/RepBonnie/status/1920909461318774937/video/3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a>, Ms. Watson Coleman, wrote that the facility had opened without permission from the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“We’ve heard stories of what it’s like in other ICE prisons,” she wrote. “We’re exercising our oversight authority to see for ourselves.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative LaMonica McIver, center, demanded the release of Mr. Baraka after his arrest outside an ICE detention facility.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In an emailed statement, Ms. McLaughlin argued that the facility had proper permits and she provided a list of five immigrants she said were being detained at Delaney Hall and had been accused of serious crimes, including murder and drug trafficking.</p><p>Ms. McIver said Mr. Baraka had done nothing wrong before his arrest.</p><p>“What we see here is despicable, and we should all be angry,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Menendez described Mr. Baraka’s arrest as “an act of intimidation.”</p><p>Ms. Watson Coleman said she had been “manhandled” and she described the events as “an abuse of power.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Other New Jersey Democrats used social media on Friday to criticize the ICE response. Gov. Philip D. Murphy described Mr. Baraka’s arrest as “unjust” and called for his immediate release in a <a href="https://x.com/GovMurphy/status/1920940075501678835/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p><p>“Mayor Baraka is an exemplary public servant who has always stood up for our most vulnerable neighbors,” Mr. Murphy wrote.</p><p>Senator Andy Kim <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kim.senate.gov" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> the arrest as “shocking” and said that he was in touch with ICE leaders and Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary. Senator Cory Booker <a href="https://x.com/SenBooker/status/1920951054448955693" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> that ICE officers should have de-escalated what he called a “disturbing, unnecessary” confrontation.</p><p>Late Friday, people waiting in a steady rain outside the ICE office in Newark for Mr. Baraka to be released chanted, “Let him out.”</p><p>After his release, Mr. Baraka said he had done nothing wrong.</p><p>“What’s happening now in this country, everybody should be scared of,” he said, adding: “They’re using the courts. They’re using everything else to justify what they’re doing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More demonstrators gathered as the afternoon wore on.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Fraser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Mark Bonamo<!-- --> and <!-- -->Taylor Robinson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.</p></div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Newark’s Mayor Is Arrested During Protest Over ICE Detention Center<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
