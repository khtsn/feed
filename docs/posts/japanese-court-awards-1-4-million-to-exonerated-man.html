Mr. Hakamada, 89, spent 44 years on death row after being convicted of murder for the deaths of four people in 1966.</p><p>His defense lawyers argued that the police forced a confession and fabricated evidence, earning him a retrial last year that led to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/world/asia/japan-death-row-exonerated.html" title="">acquittal</a>. He is believed to have been the world’s longest-serving death row inmate.</p><p>The payout, likely the largest in Japan’s history for a criminal case, was compensation for the 47-plus years that Mr. Hakamada spent in detention, <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20250324/k10014758981000.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to NHK</a>, Japan’s national broadcaster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It represents roughly $83 for each day he was detained.</p><p>Over the years, Mr. Hakamada, a former featherweight boxer, had consistently testified that he pleaded guilty only after the police interrogated him for 20 days, beating him with sticks and depriving him of sleep. He retracted his confession soon after making it.</p><p>Japan’s Supreme Court sentenced him to death in 1980. In 2014, Mr. Hakamada’s lawyers won a retrial and his release after testing showed that blood on clothing that the police had used as evidence didn’t contain his DNA.</p><p>After the Shizuoka District Court granted Mr. Hakamada a retrial in 2014, the Tokyo High Court reversed the decision and refused to reopen the case. In 2020, the Supreme Court sided with the district court and ordered a new trial, which ended with his acquittal in September.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, Hideyo Ogawa, one of Mr. Hakamada’s lawyers, told reporters that the payout would only somewhat make up for the hardships he had suffered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The country committed a crime against him,” Mr. Ogawa said.</p><p>Hisako Ueno<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
