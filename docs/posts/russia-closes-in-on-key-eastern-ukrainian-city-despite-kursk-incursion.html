Don’t delay!”</p><p>Military experts say that one goal of the surprise cross-border assault that Ukraine began last week in Russia’s western Kursk region is to compel Moscow to divert troops from the front lines in Ukraine to reinforce its own border region.</p><p>But so far, Russia has withdrawn only a limited number of units from the Ukrainian battlefield, instead seeking to counter attacks with less-experienced combat units in Russia, analysts and United States officials say.</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers said this week that there had been no letup in Russian attacks in the Donetsk region, suggesting that Moscow is pressing ahead with its long-held goal of capturing the entire area.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Boarding an evacuation train in Pokrovsk, Ukraine, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roman Pilipey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-15-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Institute for the Study of War</a>, a Washington-based think tank that tracks battlefield developments, wrote on Thursday that “Russian forces are maintaining their relatively high offensive tempo” in the Donetsk region.</p></div><div><div><p>In doing so, the Russian military command is demonstrating that it “continues to prioritize advances in eastern Ukraine even as Ukraine is pressuring Russian forces” in the Kursk region, it wrote.</p><p>Maps of the battlefield compiled by the Institute and other independent groups show that Ukrainian troops have made marginal advances in the Kursk region over the past day, capturing at least one village and pushing into several others.</p><p>Now, however, they are facing greater resistance from reinforced Russian forces and progressing more slowly as they try to consolidate their gains.</p><p>In the fight for Pokrovsk, military analysts say that Ukrainian troops will fight hard to defend the city and prevent its capture. The city has been turned into a military garrison during the war and is also a logistical hub for the Ukrainian Army, given that it sits on a key road linking several Ukrainian-held cities, including Kramatorsk, Kostiantynivka and Sloviansk.</p><p>The city’s military administration has yet to order an evacuation and has only urged residents to leave. Volodymyr Nikulin, a police officer in Pokrovsk, said that about 40,000 people were still living in the city.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
