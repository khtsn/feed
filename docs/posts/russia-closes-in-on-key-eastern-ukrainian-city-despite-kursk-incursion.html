</div></section></div><div><div><p>Military experts say that one goal of the surprise cross-border assault that Ukraine began last week in Kursk is to compel Moscow to divert troops from the front lines in Ukraine to reinforce its own border region. But so far, Russia has withdrawn only a limited number of units from the Ukrainian battlefield, instead seeking to counter attacks with less experienced combat units in Russia, analysts and United States officials say.</p><p>U.S. officials added that Ukraine had drawn on its reserves for its cross-border offensive, meaning it could be more difficult for Kyiv to bolster its troops on the eastern front.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A building that was damaged by falling missile debris in Kursk, Russia, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Ukraine’s offensive into Russia “does not affect the overall balance of the front line,” Thibault Fouillet, the deputy director of the Institute for Strategic and Defense Studies, a French research center, said in an interview. The main feature of the battlefield — Russian troops advancing slowly but steadily through bloody assaults — remained the same, he said.</p></div><div><div><p>Ukrainian soldiers said this week that Ukraine’s incursion into Russia had not led to a letup in Russian attacks in the Donetsk region. Serhiy Tsehotskiy, an officer with the 59th Motorized Brigade, <a href="https://suspilne.media/donbas/814719-front-bila-pokrovska-vnoci-armia-rf-namagalas-sturmuvati-novogrodivku/?utm_source=telegram&amp;utm_medium=ps" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the Ukrainian news media</a> on Friday that Russian forces had tried overnight to storm the town of Novohrodivka, which sits on the railroad into Pokrovsk.</p><p>“Attempts to assault and advance do not stop for a minute, and fighting continues around the clock,” he said.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1824072739478536223" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Thursday</a> that Pokrovsk and other nearby towns were “facing the most intense Russian assaults.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-15-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Institute for the Study of War</a>, a Washington-based think tank that tracks battlefield developments, wrote on Thursday that “Russian forces are maintaining their relatively high offensive tempo” in the Donetsk region. In doing so, it wrote, the Russian military command was demonstrating that it “continues to prioritize advances in eastern Ukraine even as Ukraine is pressuring Russian forces” in the Kursk region.</p></div></div><div><div><p>U.S. officials said that Russia’s monthslong push in the east may have taken on outsized importance to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia after Ukraine’s successful cross-border assault. The Russian leader is embarrassed by the debacle of his army near the border — Ukrainian forces faced little resistance as they quickly moved through Russian defensive lines and villages — and wants a battlefield victory against Ukraine to reassure the Russian public of his strategy there, the American officials said.</p><p>Maps of the battlefield compiled by the institute and other independent groups show that Ukrainian troops have made only marginal advances in the Kursk region over the past day, capturing at least one village and pushing into several others. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s top commander, <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/11373" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a> that fighting was continuing near Malaya Loknya, a village about eight miles from Ukraine’s border. His assertion could not be independently verified.</p><p>Now, however, they are facing greater resistance from reinforced Russian forces and are progressing more slowly as they try to consolidate their gains. Mr. Fouillet, the military expert, said that to hold the territory it has seized in Russia, Ukraine would have to send in more soldiers and weapons — at the risk of weakening its lines elsewhere on the battlefield.</p><p>“They’ll need to bring air defenses, install artillery, build logistic lines, replace soldiers,” Mr. Fouillet said. “Those are resources that won’t be available elsewhere.”</p><p>Soldiers fighting in the Donetsk region said they had been buoyed by the incursion into Russia. But they also said it would use up weapons and ammunition that they crucially need. One commander stationed at a hot spot on the eastern front said his brigade had fewer than four mortar guns to defend its position, and could fire only 10 shells a day per mortar.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In the fight for Pokrovsk, military analysts say that Ukrainian troops will fight hard to defend the city and prevent its capture. The city has been turned into a military garrison during the war, with many Ukrainian soldiers staying there to rest after a rotation on the front or to prepare for future operations.</p><p>Pokrovsk is also a logistical hub for the Ukrainian Army, given that it sits on a key road linking several Ukrainian-held cities in the region, including Kramatorsk, Kostiantynivka and Sloviansk. The road, Highway T054, is already within range of Russian artillery and drone strikes, but Ukraine’s army continues to use it.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Boarding an evacuation train in Pokrovsk, Ukraine, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roman Pilipey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Military analysts say Ukraine has prepared defensive lines of trenches and anti-armored-vehicle ditches around Pokrovsk, which could slow the advance of Russian troops. But whether these lines will ultimately hold remains to be seen.</p><p>The city’s military administration has yet to order an evacuation and has only urged residents to leave. Volodymyr Nikulin, a police officer in Pokrovsk, said that about 40,000 people were still in the city.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In recent days, officials in Pokrovsk have been touring community centers in an effort to persuade people to leave, giving them a timetable for the evacuation train and information about towns they could move to, <a href="https://t.me/pokrovskonline/29926" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including in the Carpathian Mountains of western Ukraine</a>.</p><p>“The enemy is advancing at a rapid pace, and the time to pack personal belongings and leave for safer regions is running out every day,” the Pokrovsk military administration <a href="https://t.me/pokrovskonline/29908" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Thursday</a>. “Evacuation is the only chance to save yourself and your loved ones!”</p><p>Julian E.
