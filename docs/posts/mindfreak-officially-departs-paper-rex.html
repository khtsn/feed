</span> has officially <a href="https://x.com/pprxteam/status/1980213932125253983" target="_blank">released</a> <span data-ref-id="1">Aaron		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9800/mindfreak">mindfreak</a>&#34;

<p>mindfreak was with Paper Rex from the very beginning, dating way back to their founding as a CS:GO team. Transitioning to Valorant with the rest of the original roster, they quickly made themselves present as a top team in the Pacific region. The Controller player particularly had a breakout performance in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1014/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-copenhagen/?src=ac" target="_blank">Masters Copenhagen</a>, where Paper Rex reached their first <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/112327/paper-rex-vs-funplus-phoenix-valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-copenhagen-gf" target="_blank">grand final</a> at an international event. In the following years, mindfreak remained as a rock of consistency and a safe pair of hands for the team as they maintained their status as a top global contender. Paper Rex found many more podium finishes, including another second place finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1657/valorant-champions-2023/?src=ac" target="_blank">Champions 2023</a>.</p>


<p><em>One of mindfreak&#39;s many ice-cold clutches that he became known for on Paper Rex.</em></p>

<p>However, Paper Rex had stagnated towards the end of 2024, and at the beginning of 2025, missed their first ever international event since 2021. Needing a change, mindfreak was the one who had to step down to bring in the new talent of <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13744/patmen">
		PatMen	</a>
</span>, whose addition immediately skyrocketed Paper Rex back to the top. This time, they reached even further than they ever had before, and grabbed their first trophy at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/?src=ac" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. </p>

<p>mindfreak was present during Masters Toronto as an assistant coach, but <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/516889/mindfreak-begins-departure-from-paper-rex" target="_blank">became a free agent</a> shortly after, looking to return to the stage as a player. Now, his time with the organization has come to an end, as both parties bid their amicable goodbyes.</p>

<p>“Its safe to say it&#39;s not one of the best, but the best moments and journey of my life,” <a href="https://x.com/aaronleonhart4/status/1980229635322634346" target="_blank">said mindfreak</a>.</p>
