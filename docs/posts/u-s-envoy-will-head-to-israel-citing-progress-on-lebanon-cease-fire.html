unusually long visit amid cautious optimism over a potential cease-fire agreement in the war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.</p><p>Speaking at a news conference in Beirut, Amos Hochstein, the senior Biden administration envoy, said that there had been “additional progress” as a result of the latest discussions, and that he would travel to Israel later on Wednesday “to try to bring this to a close if we can.”</p><p>The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, confirmed that Mr. Hochstein was expected to arrive in Israel on Wednesday night for further cease-fire discussions. Omer Dostri, the prime minister’s spokesman, said Mr. Hochstein was set to meet with Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Hochstein spoke to reporters in Beirut after meeting for a second straight day with Nabih Berri, the Hezbollah-allied speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, who has emerged as the group’s point man in the U.S.-led negotiations. During repeated rounds of shuttle diplomacy over the past year, Mr. Hochstein has seldom stayed overnight in Lebanon, so the extended visit raised hopes that negotiations could be inching forward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Biden administration dispatched Mr. Hochstein to the region in what amounted to a last-ditch effort to close a deal before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office in January. Mr. Hochstein said on Wednesday that the Biden administration would coordinate with the incoming Trump administration over cease-fire efforts in Lebanon, and that he did not believe the transfer of power in Washington would imperil efforts to bring about peace.</p><p>“We are going to work with the incoming administration. We are already going to be discussing this with them,” he said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Hochstein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/middleeast/us-envoy-lebanon-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">said</a> that the gaps between Israel and Hezbollah had “narrowed” in discussions in recent weeks, though ultimately any results from the negotiations would be “the decision of the parties.” He declined to discuss details of the negotiations.</p><p>Israel’s war with Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran, escalated in September and has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, killing more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and displacing almost a quarter of the population. It is now the bloodiest conflict inside Lebanon since the country’s civil war, which lasted from 1975 to 1990.</p><p>Here are other developments:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Israeli soldier killed:</strong> The Israeli military said a soldier was killed in combat in northern Gaza, the 800th Israeli soldier to die in the enclave since the war began in October 2023. It said another soldier had been wounded in the same incident on Tuesday. The Israeli news media reported that the two had been ambushed in a building in Beit Lahia, one of the towns in northern Gaza where Israel has mounted a weekslong offensive against Hamas militants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hospital struggles:</strong> The director of one of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza, Kamal Adwan Hospital, said the facility was providing only limited care to dozens of patients amid the Israeli military offensive. The director, Hussam Abu Safyia, said in comments reported by Gaza’s civil defense service that the hospital lacked food, water and medical supplies. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-kamal-adwan-hospital.html" title="">Israeli forces withdrew</a> from the hospital in late October after a raid during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of the medical workers were detained. </p></li></ul><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Hostages in Gaza:</strong> As he resists pressure to reach a cease-fire that would release the captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is now offering a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/middleeast/israel-5-million-dollars-hostage.html">$5 million reward for their freedom</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aid Trucks Looted in Gaza:</strong> A large convoy of trucks carrying aid was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-convoy-looted-unrwa-israel.html">“violently looted” in the enclave</a>, the main United Nations agency that helps Palestinians said, calling it one of the worst such incidents of the war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oct. 7 Leak Investigation:</strong> An Israeli judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/middleeast/israel-document-leaks.html">revealed more details</a> in a case involving an official in Netanyahu’s office and a military officer suspected of leaking and mishandling classified intelligence documents.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Fear Divides Lebanon:</strong> Tensions among multiple sects in the country have long lurked just below the surface.
