In the same period last year, the company lost more than $350 million.</p><p>Boeing’s most recent crisis began when a poorly installed panel blew away from a relatively new Boeing plane during a flight in January 2024. A two-month worker strike in the fall also stalled production of the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling plane.</p><p>The company delivered 130 planes in the first quarter, up from 83 in the same period a year ago. It also secured a major contract to build the Air Force’s newest fighter jet, the F-47, Boeing’s chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, said in a message to employees. Boeing brought in $19.5 billion in revenue during the quarter, an 18 percent rise from last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“There is a lot of good work happening across our teams, and we are seeing positive results,” Mr. Ortberg said, describing 2025 as “our turnaround year.”</p><p>Boeing’s share price jumped in premarket trading, gaining 5 percent.</p><p>Revenue at Boeing’s commercial unit was up 75 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier, while its defense unit saw a 9 percent fall. Sales were flat at its services unit, which has the biggest profit margins.</p><p>On Tuesday, the company announced plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/boeing-thoma-bravo-jeppesen.html" title="">sell several digital businesses for $10.5 billion to Thoma Bravo</a>, a private equity firm.</p><p>“This was a good quarter for Boeing,” said Peter McNally, global head of sector analysts at Third Bridge, a New York research firm. He added that offloading the digital businesses was more lucrative than expected and would bolster Boeing’s cash cushion.</p><p>Mr. Ortberg, who joined Boeing last summer, wants to refocus the company on its core business of making planes. On Wednesday, Boeing said monthly production of the 737 Max had steadily increased from the low to mid-20s in January, and should reach 38 in the next few months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The company cannot exceed that rate without permission from the Federal Aviation Administration, which limited Max production after last year’s panel blowout. Mr. Ortberg said that Boeing planned to ask for approval to reach a rate of 42 planes per month later this year.</p><p>Boeing has also stabilized production of the 787 Dreamliner at about five per month, with plans to increase that to seven planes later this year. The company’s commercial jet order book is valued at $460 billion.</p><p>The company’s efforts to recover from last year’s crisis and other disruptions could be stymied by Mr. Trump’s trade policies, which include a 10 percent tariff on nearly all imports and even higher levies on goods from China, whose airlines buy a lot of planes.</p><p>Chinese officials recently ordered the country’s carriers to stop buying or taking delivery of new Boeing planes, Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported last week. Aircraft tracking data show that new Boeing planes have returned to the United States from China in recent days.</p><p>A long-term loss of that business would be a substantial setback for Boeing. China is home to about one in seven passenger planes in use today, according to Cirium, an aviation data firm. The country commanded a similar share of Boeing’s deliveries over the past decade, though that slowed in recent years. Boeing said last summer that it expected China would need about 8,800 new planes over the next two decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p> While China is pumping money into a homegrown aircraft manufacturer, Comac, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/business/china-boeing.html" title="">the country still relies heavily</a> on Western companies for aerospace parts and expertise. It will also probably be years before Comac makes planes in substantial numbers, experts say.</p><p>On Tuesday, President Trump said that the 145 percent tariff on imports of Chinese goods would drop “substantially,” but not to zero. China has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/china-tariffs-125.html" title="">retaliated by imposing 125 percent tariffs</a> on imports from the United States.</p><p>RTX, the aerospace giant that makes plane engines and parts, said on Tuesday that the administration’s tariffs would cost it about $850 million this year. GE Aerospace, which makes engines, including those used by the 737 Max, said it expected the cost of the tariffs to be about $500 million this year.</p><p>Boeing did not estimate the cost of tariffs on Wednesday, but has said that it is sitting on big inventories of parts, many of which are made in the United States. The suppliers it relies on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/boeing-trump-tariffs.html" title="">could suffer from higher tariffs and retaliation by other countries</a>, though.</p><p>Mr. Ortberg said in his memo to employees that “we are closely watching the developments in global trade.”</p><p>Mr. Ortberg has set out to change Boeing’s culture, which has been blamed for promoting shortcuts, contributing the company’s recent crises. Last week, the company released the results of a February employee survey, which found that 67 percent of employees felt proud to work at the company, down from 91 percent in 2013.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
