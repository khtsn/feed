Trump’s son-in-law, to build a $1.4 billion luxury hotel complex on a small abandoned military base off the coast of Albania.</p><p>The project is one of several involving Mr. Trump and his extended family that directly involve foreign government entities that will be moving ahead even while Mr. Trump will be in charge of foreign policy related to these same nations.</p><p>The approval by Albania’s Strategic Investment Committee — which is led by Prime Minister Edi Rama — gives Mr. Kushner and his business partners the right to move ahead with accelerated negotiations to build the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/us/politics/trump-kushner-albania-hotels.html" title="">luxury resort</a> on a 1,400-acre section of the 2.2-square-mile island of Sazan that will be connected by ferry to the mainland.</p><p>Mr. Kushner and the Albanian government did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment. But when previously asked about this project, both have said that the evaluation is not being influenced by Mr. Kushner’s ties to Mr. Trump or any effort to try to seek favors from the U.S. government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The fact that such a renowned American entrepreneur shows his interest on investing in Albania makes us very proud and happy,” a spokesman for Mr. Rama said last year in a statement to The New York Times when asked about the projects.</p><p>Mr. Kushner’s Affinity Partners, a private equity company backed with about $4.6 billion in money mostly from Saudi Arabia and other Middle East sovereign wealth funds, is pursuing the Albania project along with Asher Abehsera, a real-estate executive that Mr. Kushner has previously teamed up with to build projects in Brooklyn, N.Y.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div

now work with their American partners to clear the proposed hotel site of any potential buried munitions and to examine any other environmental or legal concerns that need to be resolved before the project can move ahead.</p><p>The document, dated Dec. 30, notes that the government “has the right to revoke the decision,” depending on the final project negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Kushner’s firm has said the plan is to build a five-star “eco-resort community” on the island by turning a “former military base into a vibrant international destination for hospitality and wellness.”</p><p>Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump’s daughter, has said she is helping with the project as well. “We will execute on it,” she said about the project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQynxpn5qG8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">during a podcast last year</a>.</p><p>This project is just one of two major real-estate deals that Mr. Kushner is pursuing along with Mr. Abehsera that involve foreign governments.</p><p>Separately, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/politics/kushner-serbia-hotel.html" title="">the partnership received preliminary approval last year</a> to build a luxury hotel complex in Belgrade, Serbia, in the former ministry of defense building, which has sat empty for decades after it was bombed by NATO in 1999 during a war there.</p><p>Serbia and Albania have foreign policy matters pending with the United States, as both countries <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-albanian-prime-minister-edi-rama-at-a-joint-press-availability/" title="" rel="noopener

White House ethics lawyer during the Obama and Clinton administrations and also an ethics adviser to the International Monetary Fund, said even if there was no attempt to gain influence with Mr. Trump, any government deal involving his family creates that impression.</p><p>“It all looks like favoritism, like they are providing access to Kushner because they want to be on the good side of Trump,” Ms. Canter said, now with <a href="https://statedemocracydefenders.org/fund/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State Democracy Defenders Fund</a>, a group that tracks federal government corruption and ethics issues.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Lipton is an investigative reporter, who digs into a broad range of topics from Pentagon spending to toxic
