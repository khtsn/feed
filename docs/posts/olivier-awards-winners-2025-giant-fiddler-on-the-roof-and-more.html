Clive Davis, <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/theatre-dance/article/giant-review-john-lithgow-roald-dahl-royal-court-s8jwhttpv" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in The Times of London</a>, said the “subtle, intelligent and stylishly crafted” drama, written by Mark Rosenblatt and directed by Nicholas Hytner, “deserves to transfer to a bigger stage.” (Lithgow has <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/john-lithgow-jimpa-interview-sundance-1236266062/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in interviews</a> that he wants to take the play to Broadway.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Houman Barekat <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/theater/giant-royal-court-roald-dahl-antisemitism.html" title="">in a review for The New York Times</a> said that Lithgow was “superb as the beleaguered but unrepentant writer, blending affable, avuncular esprit with scowling, cranky prickliness and nonchalant cruelty.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lara Pulver and Adam Dannheisser in “Fiddler on the Roof.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johan Persson</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Two other productions also won three awards: A revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” the much-loved 1964 musical, which ran at the Regent’s Park Open Air Theater last year; and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/theater/benjamin-button-musical-west-end.html" title="">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a>,” a folk-rock adaptation of the F.

Its competitors were a production of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/theater/hello-dolly-imelda-staunton.html" title="">Hello, Dolly!</a>” that ran at the London Palladium; and ongoing revivals of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/theater/starlight-express-review-london.html" title="">Starlight Express</a>” at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theater and “<a href="https://oliverthemusical.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oliver!</a>” at the Gielgud Theater. “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” which is playing <a href="https://benjaminbuttonmusical.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at the Ambassadors Theater</a>, took home the best new musical award, as well as the best actor in a musical for its lead, John Dagleish, and the outstanding musical contribution prize.</p><p>The night’s other major prizes went to a host of productions. The best director award, which pits the most-talked-about plays and musicals against each other, went to Eline Arbo for the “The Years” — a play that has grabbed attention in London for more than the action onstage: Sonia Friedman, the show’s producer, said that at almost every performance, an audience member has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/theater/the-years-play-abortion-scene-garai.html" title="">fainted during the abortion scen</a>e.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The best actress in a musical prize went to Imelda Staunton in the title role of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/theater/hello-dolly-imelda-staunton.html" title="">Hello, Dolly!</a>”, while the best actress in a play award went to Lesley Manville for her Jocasta in Robert Icke’s “Oedipus,” which ran at Wyndham’s Theater.</p><p>The best new comedy or entertainment award went to a West End version of “Titanique,” an absurd retelling of James Cameron’s “Titanic” movie featuring Celine Dion songs that had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/theater/titanique-review.html" title="">its New York premiere</a> in 2022.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
