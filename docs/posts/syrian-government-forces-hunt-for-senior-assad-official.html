Mr. al-Hassan was responsible for crimes at Syria’s notorious Sednaya prison, according to the Syrian Observatory.</p><p>An attempt to arrest Mr. al-Hassan on Wednesday set off deadly clashes in the western region around the port of Tartus — part of the heartland of Mr. al-Assad’s Alawite minority. Government security forces were ambushed by loyalists of the former government in the area, according to the Syrian Observatory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Fourteen members of the government forces were killed, according to Mohammed Abdel Rahman, Syria’s interim interior minister.</p><p>The hunt for Mr. al-Hassan suggested that Syria’s new leaders were stepping up their efforts to pursue top members of the Assad dictatorship amid a clamor in the country for justice and accountability.</p><p>A central challenge for Syria’s new administration is to impose law and order while it attempts to hold members of the Assad regime accountable and build a system of governance.</p><p>The government forces deployed on Thursday in Mr. al-Hassan’s hometown near Tartus on Syria’s Mediterranean coast. Sana, the state-run Syrian news agency, said the forces were sent to the area to pursue “remnants of Assad militias, protect civilians and restore security and stability.”</p><p>The new government has been facing unrest cropping up in a number of regions.</p><p>During the past week, members of the minority Alawite sect have protested in cities like Latakia in the west and Homs in central Syria. A video posted online of an Alawite shrine set alight appeared to play a role in setting off the protests, but officials in the transitional government have said it was old and republished on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Protests also broke out this week in the capital, Damascus, after the burning of a Christmas tree, which heightened concerns about sectarian strife after the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the overthrow of the old government, rose to power.</p><p>The rise of Islamists in Syria has led to some fears of persecution among the country’s many minority communities, including Christians, Druse and Alawites.</p><p>Ahmad al-Shara, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has promised that minorities will be protected.</p><p>On Thursday, the interim ministry of information said it was banning the publication of content with “a sectarian character that seeks to spread division.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/bashar-alassad">Bashar al-Assad</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
