Mr. Combs, 55, has been detained since his arrest in September after a nearly 10-month federal investigation.</p><p>After Mr. Combs’s arrest, his lawyers offered a robust bail package that they argued was more than sufficient to assuage the court’s concerns about the risks of his release. They offered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-bail-appeal-private-security.html" title="">a $50 million bond</a>, secured by Mr. Combs’s Florida mansion and said that Mr. Combs would pay for round-the-clock security, with visitors restricted to family. Apart from contact with his lawyers, he would have no access to phones or the internet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prosecutors asserted that there was no way the government could trust that private security guards, paid for by Mr. Combs, could be depended on to prevent efforts toward obstructing justice, which, they argued, he had been engaging in before and after his indictment.</p><p>Judge Subramanian agreed, writing in the order that “the Court doubts the sufficiency of any conditions that place trust in Combs and individuals in his employ — like a private security detail — to follow those conditions.”</p><p>At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-bail-hearing.html" title="">a bail hearing last Friday</a>, the judge rejected the idea of Mr. Combs remaining at his Miami-area home, noting that the property has access to a dock. Instead, Mr. Combs’s lawyers proposed a Manhattan apartment.</p><p>The first two judges who considered the bail issue were persuaded by the government’s arguments that Mr. Combs posed a danger to the safety of others. Those arguments relied largely on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video.html" title="">leaked hotel security footage</a> from 2016 of Mr. Combs abusing his girlfriend, Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, which was broadcast in May by CNN. Ms. Ventura, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">filed a bombshell civil suit a year ago</a>, is the center of the government’s case, though she is identified only as “Victim-1” in its indictment.</p><p>Judge Subramanian echoed that concern for Mr. Combs’s “propensity for violence,” noting a text message from Ms. Ventura sent following the hotel assault that said, “I have a black eye and a fat lip. You are sick for thinking it’s OK to do what you’ve done.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The indictment charged Mr. Combs with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution and describes him as the boss of a yearslong criminal enterprise that threatened and abused women. Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><p>The video of Ms. Ventura had been a focal point of the detention efforts with Andrew L. Carter Jr., the district court judge first assigned to the case, calling it “disturbing” during a September bail hearing. Judge Carter later recused himself because of a professional and social relationship with a new lawyer hired by Mr. Combs’s team.</p><p>In their third attempt at securing bail, Mr. Combs’s lawyers sought to undercut the impact of that video by arguing that the government had not presented the footage in good faith, accusing prosecutors of omitting key scenes and presenting events out of order.</p><p>At the hearing last week, Christy Slavik, one of the prosecutors, said there was no mistaking Mr. Combs’s violent conduct on the video, which involved striking, kicking and dragging Ms. Ventura.</p><p>Prosecutors have worked to keep Mr. Combs in jail by arguing that he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-accused-witnesses-jail.html" title="">engaged in efforts to obstruct the prosecution</a>, both before and after he was indicted in September. They have accused him of contacting witnesses, paying a potential witness to make a public statement in his favor and using a three-way phone call from inside jail to contact an alleged co-conspirator.</p><p>In Wednesday’s order, Judge Subramanian took particular issue with Mr. Combs’s contact with a grand jury witness whom prosecutors had identified as a “male commercial sex worker.” The judge noted that Mr. Combs’s lawyers could not explain his efforts to call and text the witness even after his grand jury testimony, or why Mr. Combs deleted texts with the witness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Combs’s lawyers argued that their defendant’s contacts with witnesses have been “innocuous” and were intended to help build up his defense for trial. They underscored that the government had pointed to no threatening communications.</p><p>The grand jury has continued to meet since Mr. Combs was charged and prosecutors have said that their investigation is continuing.</p><p>Mr. Combs may continue to challenge his detention. Last month, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/arts/music/sean-combs-bail-appeal.html" title="">filed an appeal</a> with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which has been put on pause while his lawyers pursued the most recent appeal at the district level.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
