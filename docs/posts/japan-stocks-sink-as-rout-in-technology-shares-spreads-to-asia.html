Arm Holdings, the U.S. listed chip design company that is 88 percent owned by Softbank, dropped more than 10 percent on Monday.</p><p>Many financial markets in Asia, including those in China and Taiwan, were closed on Tuesday for Lunar New Year.

Those tech stocks have led the entire market higher in recent years by producing lofty returns, although concerns have grown that the broader market was overly dependent on their performance.</p><p>“While vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag 7,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. She said that the idea that U.S. stocks would continue an unabated rise “is now facing uncertainty,” noting that investors are contending with stubborn inflation and the prospect of hefty tariffs that could weigh on spending and economic growth.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
