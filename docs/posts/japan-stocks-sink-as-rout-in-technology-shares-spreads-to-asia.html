    <h1>Japan Stocks Sink as Rout in Technology Shares Spreads to Asia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Futures on the S&amp;P 500, which allow investors to bet on the index outside of typical trading hours, nudged lower during Asian trading on Tuesday, after the index fell 1.5 percent on Monday. Shares in the Silicon Valley chip company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/deepseek-nvidia-ai-chips.html" title="">Nvidia</a>, which erased roughly $600 billion of its market value on Monday, appeared to stabilize.</p><p>Nvidia is the standard-bearer of a group of giant technology companies known as the Magnificent Seven. Those tech stocks have led the entire market higher in recent years by producing lofty returns, although concerns have grown that the broader market was overly dependent on their performance.</p><p>“While vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag 7,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. She said that the idea that U.S. stocks would continue an unabated rise “is now facing uncertainty,” noting that investors are contending with stubborn inflation and the prospect of hefty tariffs that could weigh on spending and economic growth.</p></div></div>
