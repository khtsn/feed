They stood and waved through the windows as they departed.</p><p>With the Russian army at its doorstep and closing in quickly, Pokrovsk is a town bowing to reality. The police drive around with loudspeakers blaring instructions to leave now. Municipal workers have shipped out library books, elementary school desks and statues from parks and squares.</p><p>By late afternoon, with a curfew in effect, the streets were eerily deserted last week, except for military vehicles zipping about.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Ukrainian military’s surprise attack into Russia last month came as one of Kyiv’s boldest gambles of the war, bringing swift gains in land and prisoners captured. But hundreds of miles away, inside Ukraine, the wholesale evacuation of Pokrovsk is evidence of the operation’s risks.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/world/01ukraine-pokrovsk/01ukraine-pokrovsk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/world/01ukraine-pokrovsk/01ukraine-pokrovsk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/world/01ukraine-pokrovsk/01ukraine-pokrovsk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An older woman makes her way downstairs in an apartment building as a man carries her belongings." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/world/01ukraine-pokrovsk/01ukraine-pokrovsk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/world/01ukraine-pokrovsk/01ukraine-pokrovsk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/world/01ukraine-pokrovsk/01ukraine-pokrovsk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/world/01ukraine-pokrovsk/01ukraine-pokrovsk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A volunteer evacuation team helping Zoya Parosyuk, 88, as she left her home in Pokrovsk on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A resident of the industrial town of Myrnohrad, just east of Pokrovsk, was assisted by friends and family as he fled his home on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ukraine was calculating that its incursion over the border would force Russia to divert troops to defend there.

With only two more lines remaining, the incursion into Russia, and the potential diversion it might cause, was essentially a last hope.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aboard an evacuation train in Pokrovsk on Wednesday.

Signs of people fleeing are everywhere.</p><p>At the train station, coaches rattled and clanged.
