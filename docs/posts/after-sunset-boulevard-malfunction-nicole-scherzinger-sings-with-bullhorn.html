When it became clear backstage that the issues could not be resolved, Scherzinger, the show’s much-praised star, was not going to send the fans home empty-handed.</p><p>So Scherzinger, a former Pussycat Doll, grabbed a bullhorn, and took the stage to sing one of the show’s best-known songs.</p><p>“When it became apparent they couldn’t do the show, it was her idea to go out and speak to the audience, so she and Tom Francis came out,” said Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the show, referring also to one of Scherzinger’s co-stars. “She asked stage management for a bullhorn, and she gave them a performance of one of the show’s biggest numbers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The show was then canceled, and audience members were given a letter offering them a refund.</p><p>“It was very disappointing, because we booked this a long time ago,” said Emily Feurring, a nutritionist who was in the audience, “but it was also kind of exciting because it was a New York moment, and no one else will ever get that.”</p><p>“It was very sweet in a way,” she added. “And we live here, so we’ll get to go again.”</p><p>Miramontez called the problem “a technical malfunction on the sound side,” and said the show’s producers were hopeful, but not certain, that the Wednesday evening performance would proceed as scheduled.</p><p>The moment is reminiscent of others in which Broadway stars have vamped for audiences when technical issues have forced delays or cancellations to shows, many of which are dependent on electricity not only for voice amplification but also for automated set pieces, projections and building safety.</p><p>On Tuesday, Darren Criss, Helen J Shen and Dez Duron, three of the lead performers in the musical “Maybe Happy Ending” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maybehappyending/reel/DIx5MnNu67_/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">entertained the crowd with songs</a> when a medical emergency in the audience forced a lengthy pause in that show.</p><p>And earlier this year, at the first preview of the new musical “Redwood,” a mid-show delay was caused by an issue with the set’s LED screens. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/theater/idina-menzel-redwood-broadway.html?smid=url-share" title="">Idina Menzel</a>, the star, spent the time fielding questions from the audience, which was filled with fans looking for stories about her experiences performing in “Wicked” and “Rent” and as a voice actor in the “Frozen” films.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But these incidents go way back — in Atlanta in the late 1990s, an early performance of the Disney musical that became “Aida” had to be stopped because of a technical problem, and the cast did the rest of the show concert-style.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Paulson is the theater reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on N.Y.C.
