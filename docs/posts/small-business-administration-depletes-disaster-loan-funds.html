Federal officials urged eligible people to continue to apply for loans, which they would continue to process while they wait for lawmakers to pass “much-needed funding.” But Congress is not set to reconvene until Nov. 12, and congressional leaders have not committed to calling members back sooner to approve more funding for the S.B.A. or the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>“Speaker Johnson has promised that this and other disaster programs will be replenished when Congress returns, so Americans should continue to apply for these loans,” President Biden said in a statement, referring to Speaker Mike Johnson. “S.B.A. will continue to process applications and will disburse loans as soon as Congress provides the needed funding.”</p><p>Isabel Guzman, the agency’s administrator, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/milton-helene-small-business-administration-fema.html" title="">warned last week</a> that the S.B.A. would soon run out of funds, and she called on lawmakers to return to Washington to approve more money. Mr. Biden also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/biden-congress-disaster-relief-helene.html" title="">urged Congress</a> to “restore this funding” earlier this month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Johnson said that federal officials had enough disaster funding to address the immediate needs of Americans in hurricane-affected areas. He has pointed to the additional $20 billion that Congress recently approved for FEMA’s disaster relief fund.</p><p>FEMA officials have said they have enough money for the immediate recovery needs of people affected by Hurricane Milton. But they have said that they will have to evaluate how quickly they are burning through funding. Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/fema-funding-shortfall-hurricane-season.html" title="">warned that FEMA might not have enough funding</a> to make it through the rest of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/weather/hurricane-season-updates-october.html" title="">hurricane season</a>.</p><p>“There’s no question these devastating back-to-back storms have stressed the S.B.A. funding program,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement. “Congress is tracking this situation closely, and when members return in just a few short weeks, the administration should have an accurate assessment of the actual dollar amount needed and there will be strong bipartisan support to provide the necessary funding.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said last week that he was also waiting for estimates from agencies on the ground.</p><p>Some lawmakers have urged Congress to return to Washington sooner. Last week, more than <a href="https://trahan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3369" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">60 House Democrats signed a letter</a> urging Mr. Johnson to bring the House back into session to approve more disaster relief funding for the S.B.A. and FEMA.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The S.B.A. provides low-interest loans to homeowners, renters, businesses and nonprofits whose property has been damaged because of disasters. Homeowners can get loans of up to $500,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate. Homeowners and renters are also eligible for up to $100,000 to repair or replace personal property. Businesses can get loans of up to $2 million.</p><p>So far, the S.B.A. has made more than 700 loan offers totaling about $48 million and received about 37,000 applications from people affected by Hurricane Helene. The agency has received over 12,000 applications from those affected by Hurricane Milton.</p><p>The agency could continue to make a small number of new loan offers if money is made available through loan cancellations, agency officials said.</p><p>The S.B.A. has requested $1.6 billion in new funding from Congress for its disaster loan program for the full fiscal year, though agency leaders have said they would probably need more after Hurricane Milton. In 2023, the S.B.A. lent nearly $3 billion — including more than $670 million for businesses and over $2.3 billion for homeowners and renters — to help people recover from disasters.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Madeleine Ngo covers U.S. economic policy and how it affects people across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/madeleine-ngo">More about Madeleine Ngo</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-emergency-management-agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/small-business-administration">Small Business Administration</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the Aftermath of Hurricane Milton</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Climate Resistant Community:</strong> On the west coast of Florida, a town built to weather hurricanes hosted more than 2,000 people during Hurricane Milton. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/climate/florida-climate-resilience-babcock-ranch.html">Could communities like this help shape Florida’s future</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Mobile Homes at Risk: </strong>Millions of Americans, many poor and vulnerable, live in mobile and manufactured homes.
