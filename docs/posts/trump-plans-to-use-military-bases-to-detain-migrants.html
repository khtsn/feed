    <h1>Trump Plans to Use Military Bases to Detain Migrants</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Trump administration is developing a plan to detain thousands of undocumented immigrants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/migrants-military-sites.html" title="">at military sites across the country</a>. The move, which is designed to make up for a shortfall of space at immigration facilities, appears to be a significant expansion of efforts by President Trump to use wartime resources to carry out the mass deportations he promised.</p><p>Trump’s aides decided to begin at Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texas, where they are setting up a deportation hub that could eventually hold up to 10,000 migrants as they go through the process of being deported.</p><p>It could serve as a model for sites the administration aims to develop at bases in Utah, near Niagara Falls and several other locations. It is not clear how many immigrants could be held at the facilities, but the plans to rely on bases in more than a dozen states would be a major expansion of capacity.</p><p>Previous administrations have held some immigrants at military bases, most recently children who would then be released into the country to the care of relatives or friends. But the Trump administration plan would greatly expand that practice, and potentially redirect military resources to the president’s immigration goals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph taken in Jerusalem today, showing a poster of Shiri Bibas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Illean/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2fdd41dc">A botched hostage return renewed fears of fighting</h2><p>After an identification process, Israel announced today that Hamas had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-shiri-bibas.html" title="">returned an anonymous, unidentified body and not that of Shiri Bibas</a>, an Israeli hostage, as the group had claimed. Hours later, Hamas officials said they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-shiri-bibas.html" title="">handed over another body</a> that they believed belonged to Bibas — whose kidnapping, along with her young children, had come to epitomize the brutality of the Oct. 7 attack.</p><p>Israel, which said it was reviewing reports of the second repatriation, had initially accused Hamas of breaching the cease-fire deal. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-bibas-hostages.html" title="">revelation had prompted alarm</a> over the future of the brittle truce, and the fate of the remaining hostages — who have now been held in Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages.html" title="">for more than 500 days</a>.

The leading candidate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/europe/germany-merz.html" title="">Friedrich Merz</a> of the Christian Democrats, is considered a potentially better counter to Trump than the current Social Democratic chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Polling second is the far-right party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/alice-weidel-germany-far-right-afd.html" title="">Alternative for Germany</a>, or AfD, which has been linked to neo-Nazis and plots to overthrow the state.</p><p>The top issue for voters, according to our Berlin bureau chief, Jim Tankersley, is the economy — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/21/world/europe/germany-economy-election.html" title="">which is no longer the envy of Europe</a>. “Germany is in a crisis of stagnant growth and declining competitiveness,” Jim said. “Its famed industries, like auto manufacturing, are slumping.

It was a shock to the eyes, though not actually a surprise. Starting in the 1970s, the team’s owner George Steinbrenner had required every Yankee to sport short hair and a clean shave. The policy has occasionally rankled players, but greats like Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams complied.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>This year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/sports/baseball/yankees-beards-facial-hair-policy.html" title="">that tradition is coming to an end</a>.
