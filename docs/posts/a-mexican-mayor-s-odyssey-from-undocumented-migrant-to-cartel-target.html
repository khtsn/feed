    <h1>A Mexican Mayor’s Odyssey: From Undocumented Migrant to Cartel Target</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Crispín Agustín Mendoza had just announced he was running for mayor of Alcozauca, a remote hamlet in the strife-torn mountains of southwest Mexico. Then, in the middle of the night, the gunmen arrived.</p><p>His wife and children screamed in fear as the men sprayed their home with gunfire in a failed bid to kill him. Undeterred, Mr. Mendoza stayed in the race and won. He is among the politicians who somehow survived assassination attempts this year in one of the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/americas/mexico-election-violence.html" title="">violent</a> election cycles in Mexico’s recent history.</p><p>But Mr. Mendoza stands out for another reason. Smuggled as an adolescent<span>  </span>into the United States, he lived undocumented in Silicon Valley’s shadow economy well into adulthood, only to follow his star back to Mexico, start his own thriving business and try his hand at politics.</p><p>Now, he is getting a frontline glimpse of the cartel turf battles overwhelming Guerrero, a Mexican state of 3.5 million known for exceptionally brutal attacks on public officials in recent weeks: like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/americas/chilpancingo-mayor-beheaded-mexico-arrest.html" title="">beheading</a> of the mayor of the state capital, Chilpancingo; and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-violence-judge-killed-acapulco-d1cd40ee371f787c47393a990424186a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fatal shooting</a> of a judge in Acapulco in broad daylight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“You have to assume one day you’ll be attacked and killed,” Mr. Mendoza, 41, said nonchalantly in lightly accented English, which he frequently peppers with Californian slang, during a recent interview in Alcozauca’s Town Hall.</p><p>A security detail of six soldiers accompanies Mr. Mendoza 24 hours a day. He faces both the challenge of staying alive and political shifts in the United States that could potentially upend towns like his own.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two men, one wearing a helmet and camouflage, walk in daylight in the middle of a street near store fronts and a motorcycle." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/1e4c4a8a-d158-551c-b077-4dd1989a5aba" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mendoza with a member of his security detail.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Situated in mountains that until a few years ago were blanketed with opium poppies, the plant used to make heroin, Alcozauca is an eight-hour drive from Mexico City, the last leg on spine-challenging washboard dirt roads.</p><p>But the rise of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/americas/mexico-fentanyl-chemistry-students.html" title="">produced</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/americas/inside-fentanyl-lab-mexico.html" title="">makeshift labs</a> in northern Mexico, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/world/americas/mexico-drugs-migration.html" title="">laid waste</a> to Guerrero’s heroin trade. With few other employment options, many people in the state migrated to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Remittances sent home now support the economy of Alcozauca, a town of about 3,100 people, and Mr. Mendoza himself, who builds homes for Mexicans who hope to return one day to their hometown.</p><p>“I build their dream houses,” Mr. Mendoza said. “That means I depend strictly on the U.S. economy.”</p><p>Reflecting on President-elect Donald J. Trump’s promise of mass deportations, he sighed, concerned about potential disruptions to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/us/trump-immigrants-deportations.html" title="">remittance flows to Mexico</a>, which amounted to $63 billion in 2023 and represent one of the country’s primary sources of income.</p><p>“Things are obviously about to change,” Mr. Mendoza said.</p><p>Mr. Mendoza has been dealing with shifts in migration dynamics nearly his entire life. His parents left for California’s Bay Area when he was an infant, leaving him to be raised by his grandparents. He said he rejoined his parents in San Jose, Calif., at 14, when he was smuggled across the border near Tijuana in the trunk of a Ford Taurus.</p><p>While attending Leland High School in San Jose, he excelled in English, cross country and academics, drawing inspiration from leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and the U.S. farmworker organizer Cesar Chavez.</p><p>Mr. Mendoza described his further education at Chico State in Chico, Calif., and De Anza College in Cupertino, Calif., where he earned a degree in university studies, as particularly enlightening. A course taught by a professor who specialized in Brazil’s Indigenous peoples deepened his understanding and appreciation of his own Indigenous Mixtec heritage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Mendoza said he originally planned on attending law school to find a way for him and others migrants brought to the United States as children to legally remain in the country.</p><p>Then came the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/books/review/ben-bernanke-timothy-geithner-henry-paulson-firefighting.html" title="">financial crash of 2008</a>. When construction work dried up, Mr. Mendoza decided to return to his hometown for a few months of vacation, with plans to return to California.</p><p>“Then I met my wife and fell in love,” said Mr. Mendoza, now the father of three. “To my family’s surprise back in California, I decided my life was here.”</p><p>With the skills he learned in the construction trade in the United States, Mr. Mendoza went to work as a developer, building houses for other migrants living north of the border. The homes sell in Alcozauca for the equivalent of about $150,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mendoza says his goal is to avoid getting tangled up in the criminal feuds around Alcozauca while responding to shifting political and economic winds.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Then, Mr. Mendoza decided to go into politics, initially for Morena, Mexico’s leftist governing party. But when Morena supported another mayoral candidate, he joined the smaller Guerrero Wellbeing Party.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>That was about the time in March, when assassins targeted his home. As his wife and children hid under a bed, Mr. Mendoza said, he grabbed his revolver, which he carries nearly everywhere, and returned fire from the roof of their home.</p><p>He said he landed at least one shot on the sedan carrying the assailants but was unsure if he wounded anyone. Afterward, a profanity-laden <a href="https://www.infobae.com/mexico/2024/04/06/con-narcomantas-amenazan-a-crispin-agustin-candidato-del-partido-del-bienestar-en-guerrero/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screed</a> handwritten on a sheet appeared in Alcozauca, attributing the attack to operatives loyal to a shadowy crime boss called “El Señor.”</p><p>Mr. Mendoza said he believed the attack might have been orchestrated by a cartel supporting a rival candidate in Alcozauca’s mayoral race.</p><p>“Being a mayor is very good business for a lot of people,” he explained, describing how elected officials often skim money from public works projects, pocketing some while distributing percentages among allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Beyond such corruption, Guerrero is known for jaw-dropping lawlessness. Cartels in the state have started using <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-cartel-attack-guerrero-drones-helidoro-castillo-ed795770ce9a09b1c063d91913268b99" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drones</a> to drop makeshift bombs. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-bodies-dumped-cartels-guerrero-4df764f5c847c0ed6b0e52a868c49876" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discoveries</a> of bodies dumped by roadsides are a regular occurrence. In La Montaña, the mountainous region where Alcozauca is, <a href="https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/estados/2024/06/22/violencia-en-guerrero-asesinan-a-acasio-flores-alcalde-de-malinaltepec-guerrero/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">political assassinations</a> are routine.</p><p>The state is a center for organized crime, with dozens of relatively small cartels battling one another to control extortion rackets, smuggling routes and trafficking of illicit drugs, mainly crystal meth.</p><p>These groups require cooperative officials at the local level, Mr. Mendoza said, adding,<span>  </span>“When I got into politics, I never thought it would be like this.”</p><p>To this day, Mr. Mendoza refuses to sit at the mayor’s desk in the Town Hall, saying that doing so would bring him closer to the corrupt practices of his predecessors. The man who held the post before him faced claims that he had physically assaulted his <a href="https://www.debate.com.mx/policiacas/Fiscalia-investiga-a-alcalde-de-Guerrero-por-haber-golpeado-a-su-esposa-20220912-0351.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wife</a> and a <a href="https://www.milenio.com/estados/alcalde-alcozauca-denunciado-penalmente-golpear-sindico" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">municipal official</a> in separate episodes.</p><p>Some in Alcozauca have a hard time believing that Mr. Mendoza, or any mayor for that matter, is clean. , Social media <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089449639612&amp;mibextid=LQQJ4d&amp;rdid=iSDXW3JSuGyBJSRZ&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F18KikxU1Yr%2F%3Fmibextid%3DLQQJ4d#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pages</a> are filled with unsubstantiated accusations against the mayor and other political figures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mendoza refuses to sit at the mayor’s desk in the local Town Hall, saying that doing so would bring him closer to the corrupt practices of his predecessors.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But others laud Mr. Mendoza for his business instincts and generosity, after he became known to townspeople for helping out of his own pocket with emergency expenses like medical care or funerals.</p><p>Josefina Reyes, 45, said Mr. Mendoza came to her aid when her father died. “He helped us with the transportation of the body, donated the coffin and provided supplies for the wake,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Mendoza insists his goal is to avoid getting tangled up in the criminal feuds around Alcozauca while responding to shifting political and economic winds. While he doesn’t agree with Mr. Trump’s view of migrants, Mr. Mendoza said he understood where such sentiment came from.</p><p>“Biden permitted a lot of people to come into the U.S.,” he said. “That affected job opportunities for a lot of people already there since a lot of businesses have more than enough labor,” he added, referring to the effects on his own longer-established relatives in California.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Still, Mr. Mendoza said his top priority is the safety of his family. The soldiers sleep on mattresses in his garage.</p><p>He plans to finish his three-year term as mayor with the aim of improving life in Alcozauca, then drop politics for good. In the meantime, he said, he understood the risks.</p><p>“This is the real Mexico,” he said. “What can I do — I’m in and I have to learn how to survive.”</p><p>Lenin Mosso contributed reporting, and <!-- -->Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Simon Romero is a Times correspondent covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
