Undeterred, Mr. Mendoza stayed in the race and won. He is among the politicians who somehow survived assassination attempts this year in one of the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/americas/mexico-election-violence.html" title="">violent</a> election cycles in Mexico’s recent history.</p><p>But Mr. Mendoza stands out for another reason. Smuggled as an adolescent<span>  </span>into the United States, he lived undocumented in Silicon Valley’s shadow economy well into adulthood, only to follow his star back to Mexico, start his own thriving business and try his hand at politics.</p><p>Now, he is getting a frontline glimpse of the cartel turf battles overwhelming Guerrero, a Mexican state of 3.5 million known for exceptionally brutal attacks on public officials in recent weeks: like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/americas/chilpancingo-mayor-beheaded-mexico-arrest.html" title="">beheading</a> of the mayor of the state capital, Chilpancingo; and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-violence-judge-killed-acapulco-d1cd40ee371f787c47393a990424186a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fatal shooting</a> of a judge in Acapulco in broad daylight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“You have to assume one day you’ll be attacked and killed,” Mr. Mendoza, 41, said nonchalantly in lightly accented English, which he frequently peppers with Californian slang, during a recent interview in Alcozauca’s Town Hall.</p><p>A security detail of six soldiers accompanies Mr. Mendoza 24 hours a day. He faces both the challenge of staying alive and political shifts in the United States that could potentially upend towns like his own.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two men, one wearing a helmet and camouflage, walk in daylight in the middle of a street near store fronts and a motorcycle." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/03/multimedia/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw/03mexico-Mendoza-profile-fbhw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/1e4c4a8a-d158-551c-b077-4dd1989a5aba" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mendoza with a member of his security detail.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Situated in mountains that until a few years ago were blanketed with opium poppies, the plant used to make heroin, Alcozauca is an eight-hour drive from Mexico City, the last leg on spine-challenging washboard dirt roads.</p><p>But the rise of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/americas/mexico-fentanyl-chemistry-students.html" title="">produced</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/americas/inside-fentanyl-lab-mexico.html" title="">makeshift labs</a> in northern Mexico, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/world/americas/mexico-drugs-migration.html" title="">laid waste</a> to Guerrero’s heroin trade.

His parents left for California’s Bay Area when he was an infant, leaving him to be raised by his grandparents. He said he rejoined his parents in San Jose, Calif., at 14, when he was smuggled across the border near Tijuana in the trunk of a Ford Taurus.</p><p>While attending Leland High School in San Jose, he excelled in English, cross country and academics, drawing inspiration from leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and the U.S. farmworker organizer Cesar Chavez.</p><p>Mr. Mendoza described his further education at Chico State in Chico, Calif., and De Anza College in Cupertino, Calif., where he earned a degree in university studies, as particularly enlightening. A course taught by a professor who specialized in Brazil’s Indigenous peoples deepened his understanding and appreciation of his own Indigenous Mixtec heritage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Mendoza said he originally planned on attending law school to find a way for him and others migrants brought to the United States as children to legally remain in the country.</p><p>Then came the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/books/review/ben-bernanke-timothy-geithner-henry-paulson-firefighting.html" title="">financial crash of 2008</a>.
