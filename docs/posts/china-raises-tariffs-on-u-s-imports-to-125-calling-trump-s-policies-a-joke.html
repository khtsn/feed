</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Over the past two weeks, China and the United States have been engaged in a fast-moving tit-for-tat that has resulted in ever-higher barriers to trade, churning markets and threatening economies around the world.</p><p>This week, Mr. Trump reversed course on the so-called reciprocal tariffs he had placed on dozens of countries. But instead of pausing the levies on China, he chose to raise the tariffs to 125 percent as a penalty for what he called China’s “lack of respect.” The move followed Beijing’s decision to tax American goods at 84 percent.</p><p>Over years of mutual commerce, American and Chinese companies have grown dependent on each other — for supply chains and factories on one side, and for access to markets on the other. But now the dizzying displays of retaliation have forced business partners to abruptly slash orders and hope for some kind of détente.</p><p>Adding to the confusion, the White House on Thursday, a day after saying tariffs on Chinese imports were 125 percent, clarified that the taxes had actually been set at a minimum of 145 percent. Additional sector-specific tariffs have been imposed on imports of cars, steel and aluminum, as well as other goods that have been subjected to levies since Mr. Trump’s first presidency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Friday, Mr. Xi spoke publicly about tariffs for the first time since Washington and Beijing started hitting each other with progressively higher levies.</p><p>“There are no winners in a tariff war and going against the world will only result in self-isolation,” said Mr. Xi, who was meeting with the prime minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez. The European Union, of which Spain is a member, has taken China to task over its overproduction of products like electrical vehicles and its dumping of cheap goods in other countries.</p><p>The Trump administration’s approach to China was a “numbers game which has no practical significance on economics,” a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said at news conference on Friday. “It’s become a joke,” said the spokesperson</p><p>For years, the two countries prospered together, based on a recognition they both benefited from China joining the global trading system through institutions like the World Trade Organization. American companies, in return, were given access to China’s huge base of consumers while American shoppers could buy everything — from socks to computers — at much cheaper prices.</p><p>More recently, though, the United States and China had engaged in low level combat. As Beijing ramped up state subsidies of key industries and Mr. Xi pushed China to become less reliant on American technology, the U.S.-China economic relationship began to fray. Then in Mr. Trump’s first presidency he waged a trade war that ultimately resulted in an armistice in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>This time around, in Mr. Trump’s second term, the gloves are off. Even before he entered the White House, Mr. Trump foreshadowed a determination to “make China pay.” Mr. Trump has focused his anger on the massive trade imbalance with China, which sells significantly more to America than it buys.</p><p>China, for its part, vowed this week to “fight to the end.”</p><p>For bewildered onlookers around the world, the question is: Where do the two countries go from here? Trade between the United States and China has defined the global economic order for decades and has benefited not just American and Chinese companies but other countries and entire regions.</p><p>Some experts warned that the escalations can only lead to more hostility, turning trade, once a foundation of stability, into another flashpoint.</p><p>Others, like Wang Xiangwei, a former editor in chief of The South China Morning Post and an expert on Chinese affairs, argued that the only thing left for both countries to do was to come to the table.</p><p>“I believe serious talks are most likely to start only after tariffs are raised to preposterous levels as they are now,” Mr. Wang said.</p><p>Zixu Wang<!-- --> contributed research from Hong Kong.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alexandra Stevenson is the Shanghai bureau chief for The Times, reporting on China’s economy and society.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Chinese Factories</strong>: Factory workers at all levels in China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/guangzhou-china-exports-tariffs.html">are worried about their jobs after President Trump ratcheted up tariffs</a> on the country’s goods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stock Market Comments: </strong>President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-stock-market.html">urged his social media audience to invest in the stock market just hours before pausing</a> most of his reciprocal tariffs, raising questions among government ethics experts about market manipulation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uncertainty at Walmart:</strong> Executives for the largest U.S. retailer emphasized that Trump’s tariff moves <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/walmart-trump-tariffs.html">have made their first-quarter growth difficult to predict</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Europe Braces for What’s Next: </strong>The European Union <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/world/europe/european-union-trump-tariffs-pause.html">said it would delay retaliatory tariffs after President Trump hit pause on some of the levies he ordered</a>, though higher tariffs are still in place for European cars and key metals.</p></li><li><p><strong>A ‘Sensible, Stable’ Haven?</strong>: Avoiding the brunt of Trump’s tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/uk-trade-trump-tariffs.html">Britain sees an opportunity</a> to serve as a refuge from the trade war that has rattled markets and the global economy.</p></li><li><p><strong> ‘Totally Silly’: </strong>Trump is fixated on the trade deficit that the United States runs with other nations.
