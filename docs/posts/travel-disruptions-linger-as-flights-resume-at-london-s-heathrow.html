    <h1>Travel Disruptions Linger as Flights Resume at London’s Heathrow</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Heathrow Airport in London, one of the world’s busiest air hubs, was set to resume a full day of service on Saturday. But after a fire at an electrical substation halted operations for most of Friday, global travel remained disrupted.</p><p>The police were still investigating what had caused the fire at the substation in western London that cut power to tens of thousands of nearby homes as well as to Heathrow. The Metropolitan Police said there was no immediate indication of foul play.</p><p>British Airways, Heathrow’s largest carrier, said late Friday that it expected about 85 percent of its nearly 600 departures and arrivals scheduled for Saturday to go ahead but that delays were likely to affect all passengers. The airline said it was also canceling flights on high-frequency routes where passengers have more rebooking options.</p><p>It took 16 hours to end the disruption that began in the early morning hours of Friday. More than a thousand flights were diverted, wreaking havoc on more than a quarter of a million people’s travel plans, Cirium, an aviation data company, estimated.</p></div></div>
