    <h1>Travel Disruptions Linger as Flights Resume at London’s Heathrow</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It took 16 hours to end the disruption that began in the early morning hours of Friday. More than a thousand flights were diverted, wreaking havoc on more than a quarter of a million people’s travel plans, Cirium, an aviation data company, estimated.</p><p>Arrivals resumed Friday evening. A Heathrow representative said significant delays were expected in the coming days as airlines tried to return their planes to their usual schedules.</p><p>Planes from all over the world were heading to Heathrow early Saturday, including from Hong Kong, South Africa and Brazil, according to Flightradar24, a tracking website.</p><p>Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow’s chief executive, said that at the time of the substation fire, a backup transformer was working as it should when the airport lost power but that it was not enough to run the entire facility. The London Fire Brigade said that it had been difficult to extinguish the blaze because the substation held thousands of gallons of cooling oil.</p><p>Britain’s National Grid said that the substation’s network was reconfigured to partly restore power temporarily to the airport and other customers.</p></div></div>
