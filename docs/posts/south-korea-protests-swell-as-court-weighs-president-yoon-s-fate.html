The walls of the court have been fortified with razor wire as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-court-impeachment.html" title="">the eight justices</a> prepare the ruling, which could shape the future of the country’s democracy.</p><p>The decision could help bring an end to the months of political turmoil Mr. Yoon unleashed on Dec. 3 with his failed attempt to place his country under martial law. Or it could push the country into a deeper political crisis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>South Koreans have grown weary of the prolonged political uncertainty and want the court to decide. But it has kept them on edge for weeks, giving no hint when its justices will deliver probably the most consequential ruling of their careers.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/22/skorea-protest-image/skorea-protest-image-videoLarge.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/22/skorea-protest-image/skorea-protest-image-videoLarge.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/22/136329_1_skorea-protest_wg_mobile_480p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A compilation of screenshots of traffic camera video from Seoul’s Urban Traffic Information Center between 5:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday shows how protesters gathered in central Seoul.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>By Agnes Chang and Weiyi Cai</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As the deliberations dragged on, conspiracy theories abounded and speculation flourished. Some suggested that the court was irreparably split. (The votes of at least six of the eight justices are needed to remove Mr. Yoon. Otherwise, he will be reinstated.) Others said it was just taking time to make its historic ruling watertight.</p><p>“The country is at a crossroads,” said Cho Gab-je, a prominent South Korean journalist and publisher who has covered the nation’s political evolution since 1971. “If the court reinstalls Yoon in office despite what he did, it will give future leaders of the country a license to rule by martial law. South Korea will become a banana republic.”</p><p>The political instability Mr. Yoon set off has left his country without an elected leader at a time when North Korea is escalating its nuclear threat and strengthening military ties with Russia. Although South Korea is one of America’s key allies, its leader has yet to meet President Trump while leaders of other nations, including Japan, have.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In February, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s <a href="https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Democracy Index 2024</a> downgraded South Korea from a “full” to a “flawed democracy.”</p><p>Mr. Yoon’s martial law <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/10/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-president-yoon.html" title="">lasted only six hours</a> but provoked fury among many South Koreans. The National Assembly impeached him on Dec. 14, suspending him from office. If Mr. Yoon is removed, South Korea will elect a new president within 60 days.</p><p>Polls in recent weeks showed that South Koreans preferred Mr. Yoon’s ouster to his reinstatement roughly three to two. But in a deeply divided nation, Parliament’s decision to impeach him has also galvanized the political right.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers controlling crowds near the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

It’s an order from the people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators supporting the impeachment of Mr. Yoon gathered near the Constitutional Court on Saturday.

People on both sides have shaved their heads or gone on hunger strike to press their demands.</p><p>“If it endorses Yoon’s impeachment, there will be some commotion, but the political landscape will quickly shift toward a presidential election,” said Shang E. Ha, a professor of political science at Sogang University in Seoul. “But if he returns to office, even those who have been waiting patiently for a ruling will take to the streets. We will see riots.”</p><p>In January, scores of Yoon supporters vandalized a Seoul district courthouse after a judge there issued a warrant to arrest him on an insurrection charge. Two supporters of Mr. Yoon died after setting themselves on fire to protest his impeachment.</p><p>The police are preparing for the worst. Schools, street vendors and a former royal palace in the neighborhood of the Constitutional Court will close on the day of ruling. The authorities also called for the removal of rocks, empty bottles, trash bins — anything that could be a weapon — from the streets. About 14,000 police officers were ready to deploy. Drones have been banned from flying over the courthouse, and all 86,000 privately owned guns in the country must be kept locked in police stations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of President Yoon could take photos with a banner featuring their impeached leader during a rally on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

Officers have escorted the eight justices on their commute to and from the court.</p><p>“I urge the people to respect and accept whatever the court decides,” said Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok, the country’s acting president, while expressing concern over the potential for violent clashes.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
