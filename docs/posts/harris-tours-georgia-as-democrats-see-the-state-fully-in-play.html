Trump in Georgia, kicking off a bus tour on Wednesday in the rural southeastern corner of the battleground state.</p><p>Ms. Harris’s trip reflects a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/harris-trump-democrats-georgia.html" title="">growing sense of optimism</a> among Georgia Democrats that she could hold on to a state President Biden narrowly won in 2020. The Democratic ticket’s standing in the polls there has increased significantly since Mr. Biden dropped out of the race, although Ms. Harris still trails Mr. Trump, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-georgia.html" title="">a New York Times polling average</a>. She is being joined by her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, on the two-day bus tour, which will culminate with a rally in Savannah.</p><p>The bus tour also underscores the Harris campaign’s efforts to motivate rural Democrats not just in Georgia but also in nearby North Carolina, a demographically similar Sunbelt state.</p><p>Both states have significant populations of Black voters, including many who live in rural areas. Democrats have said they must drive up turnout outside the cities and suburbs to defeat Mr. Trump statewide. Polls show Ms. Harris performing far better in North Carolina than Mr. Biden did, and her allies in the state have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/kamala-harris-north-carolina.html" title="">compared the energy of her campaign to Barack Obama’s in 2008</a>, the last time a Democrat was victorious there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Her swing through Georgia with Mr. Walz carries echoes of Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, in which he and Al Gore, his running mate, traversed the Peach State’s rural towns with their wives, as Mr. Clinton leaned on his Southern bona fides. Mr. Clinton later won Georgia by less than a percentage point, making him the last Democrat to take the state before Mr. Biden’s victory in 2020.</p><p>Mr. Biden won Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes and lost North Carolina by under 75,000, his closest defeat in the election. The two states, which had been leaning toward Mr. Trump before Ms. Harris’s rise, are now considered tossups. One of Mr. Trump’s easiest paths to victory involves holding North Carolina and flipping Georgia and Pennsylvania, which with 19 electoral votes is the most valuable of the battleground states.</p><p>The Harris campaign knows that winning Georgia or North Carolina would almost certainly guarantee her the White House. A Democrat who can defeat Mr. Trump in those traditionally moderate states is likely to face a far easier route to victory in the union-heavy blue wall of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p><p>Republicans know that, too. Mr. Trump and his allies have invested heavily in advertising in Georgia and North Carolina.</p><p>“If Harris wins North Carolina, she’s the next president of the United States,” Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, said in an interview this month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There has been some tension between Democrats in Georgia and North Carolina as they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/us/politics/biden-trump-north-carolina-georgia.html" title="">lobby their national party for resources</a>.</p><p>North Carolina Democrats have been particularly motivated by the Republican candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who is from his party’s far-right wing and has called for banning abortion at six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. In contrast, Georgia has no competitive statewide races this year, unlike in 2020, when the Senate campaigns of Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff helped turn out Democrats alongside Mr. Biden.</p><p>That is part of why Democrats have set their sights beyond the deep-blue Metro Atlanta area and are trying to mobilize voters in Georgia’s southeast and coastal regions, where there are many Black voters whose support will matter at the margins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris speaks with a group of students from Savannah State University after arriving in Georgia on Wednesday.

A previous Times/Siena survey of the Sun Belt states — which did not include North Carolina — found Mr. Trump beating Mr. Biden by eight points in Georgia.</p><p>Although Mr. Biden won in 2020 thanks in large part to turnout from Black voters, his support from them dimmed amid high inflation. Ms. Harris, who is Black and of South Asian descent, has re-energized many of them, polls show.</p><p>Black voters make up roughly one-third of the electorate in Georgia and one-quarter in North Carolina, both higher than their representation nationwide. In 2020, about 13 percent of Americans who cast ballots were Black.</p><p>Georgia and North Carolina aren’t the only states where the Harris campaign is targeting rural voters. She and Mr. Walz also took a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/harris-walz-pennsylvania-bus-tour.html" title="">bus tour</a> this month through a conservative county outside Pittsburgh.</p><p>Ms. Harris is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/kamala-harris-fundraising.html" title="">raising money at a faster pace</a> than Mr. Trump, allowing her to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/harris-trump-ads-economy.html" title="">flood the airwaves</a> in the battleground states. She has also built a more robust infrastructure of campaign offices and staff than Mr. Trump, which Democrats say will give her the advantage in getting out the vote. The Trump campaign is relying more on a force of volunteers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/trump-voter-outreach-super-pacs.html" title="">well-funded efforts from outside super PACs</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maya King is a politics reporter covering the Southeast, based in Atlanta.
