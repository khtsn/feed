He responded “TRUE!!!” to a post by a conservative activist summarizing the strategy.</p><p>Similar plans were described during the campaign by Stephen Miller, Trump’s top immigration policy adviser. Miller said that the military would be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">used to build “vast holding facilities”</a> for migrants as their cases progressed, and suggested that Trump might invoke a public health emergency power to curtail hearing asylum claims. Trump’s team also shared plans to stop issuing passports to the newborn children of undocumented immigrants in a bid to end birthright citizenship.</p><p>Trump’s team said it had developed a plan to significantly increase the number of deportations without new legislation from Congress. They anticipate legal challenges, but presidents have broad power to declare national emergencies.</p><p>Trump has already signaled his intent to follow through on mass deportations by naming a team of immigration hard-liners, including Miller and Thomas Homan, in top White House policy roles.
