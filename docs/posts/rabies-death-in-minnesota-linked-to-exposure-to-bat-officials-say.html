The Minnesota Department of Health said there was not a public health risk.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/health/rabies-deaths.html" title="">Fewer than 10 rabies deaths</a> are reported annually in the United States, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the C.D.C.</a>, and 70 percent of those deaths are attributed to exposure to bats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Previous human cases in Minnesota — all of which were fatal — were recorded in 1917, 1964, 1975, 2000, 2007 and 2021, according to the department.</p><p>“If left untreated, rabies is almost always fatal,” the department said. “Rabies treatment has proven to be nearly 100 percent effective at preventing the disease after an exposure, but it must be started before symptoms of rabies appear.”</p><p>The patient in the most recent case was over 65 years old, but no other information, such as gender, place of residence or the nature of the interaction with the bat, was made public.</p><p>Officials at the Minnesota Health Department and the C.D.C. did not immediately respond to requests seeking further information on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Brant County Health Unit in Brantford, Ontario, this month <a href="https://bchu.org/brant-county-health-unit-confirms-rabies-case-in-brantford-brant-resident/?fbclid=IwY2xjawFlPRhleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHWZzMmu558p1ekpfhutr0Kf7Ovl9dfwm5-OLEsdm9932K_kFK3xCqjiZZA_aem_tlD-26RKJk-5H5CA4z05Fw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported Ontario’s first</a> domestic human rabies case since 1967.

Death is often caused by severe brain damage or cardiac arrest.</p><p>Bats have tiny teeth so a bite mark may not appear, <a href="https://ehs.umich.edu/living-safely/community-health/bats-and-rabies/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20because%20bats%20have,A%20child" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Department of Environment, Health and Safety</a> at the University of Michigan. Sometimes victims don’t even feel themselves being bit.</p><p>Pets are also known to contract and pass on rabies. Many municipalities have <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vet/rabies1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laws requiring pets</a> that might be susceptible to rabies to get vaccinated.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
