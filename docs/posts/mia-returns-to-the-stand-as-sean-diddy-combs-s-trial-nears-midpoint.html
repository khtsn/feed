He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have strongly denied that any of his sexual arrangements were nonconsensual.</p><p>If convicted of all charges, Mr. Combs, 55, could face life in prison.</p><p>Mr. Steel’s cross-examination of Mia has leaned heavily on text messages and social media posts in which she expressed fondness and admiration for the mogul, both during her employment and after. Mr. Steel has repeatedly asked how she could say such things about the man she now accuses of violating her.</p><p>“The version of Puff that did treat me like the best friend, I did love that dude,” Mia said, using a nickname for Mr. Combs. “He protected me from the other versions of himself. And I didn’t understand what happened to me until recently as he was still being praised by everybody in the world. So how would I have known?”</p><p>Responding to a text exchange from 2019, she said she had reached out soon after the death of Kim Porter, the mother of three of Mr. Combs’s children, late in 2018. “I felt horrible for him,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Steel, pointing to those and other messages, asked Mia whether her accusations of abuse were untrue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I have never lied in this courtroom,” she answered, “and I never will lie in this courtroom.”</p><p>Mia is the 21st witness in the case, which is entering the fourth week of what is expected to be an eight-week trial.</p><p>The government argues that Mr. Combs was a violent and abusive man who controlled, intimidated and sexually violated women, and that he directed employees to commit arson, bribery, forced labor, obstruction of justice and other crimes on his behalf as part of a “criminal enterprise.”</p><p>Among the previous witnesses in the case are Ms. Ventura, the singer known as Cassie, who said she had been coerced intro drug-fueled sex marathons, and a stylist, Deonte Nash, who described witnessing Mr. Combs’s violent attacks on Ms. Ventura. Mr. Nash said Ms. Ventura told him about Mr. Combs’s threats to release explicit videos of her with other men in “freak-offs,” the sexual encounters that are at the heart of the government’s case. Ms. Ventura had called those videos “blackmail materials.”</p><p>The list of the government’s next planned witnesses suggest that the prosecution will further examine the circumstances of freak-offs.</p><p>One witness, Eddy Garcia, was a supervisor at an InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, where a security camera recorded Mr. Combs attacking Ms. Ventura in 2016 — an incident that has been the subject of testimony by multiple witnesses. Mr. Garcia will testify under an immunity order by the court, which he attested to at the start of the proceedings on Monday.</p><p>Frank Piazza, a forensic video expert who examined that hotel footage, is also expected to testify. Other witnesses early this week may include Sylvia Okun, a hotel custodian, and a man named Enrique Santos.</p><p>Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
