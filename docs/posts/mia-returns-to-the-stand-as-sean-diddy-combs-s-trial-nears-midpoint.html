He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have strongly denied that any of his sexual arrangements were nonconsensual.</p><p>If convicted of all charges, Mr. Combs, 55, could face life in prison.</p><p>In her third day on the stand, the woman, who is testifying under the pseudonym Mia, was cross-examined by Brian Steel, a lawyer for Mr. Combs. He repeatedly challenged her accusation that Mr. Combs had sexually assaulted her multiple times during the years she worked for him, and asked why she had not disclosed those allegations earlier.</p><p>Mia worked for Mr. Combs from 2009 to 2017, as a personal assistant and then in a film division of his company. She testified that during her employment she had been subjected to sleep deprivation and violence, and that she was sexually assaulted by Mr. Combs, including an occasion when she said he entered a bedroom where she was sleeping and penetrated her without her consent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mia acknowledged that aside from telling a therapist, she did not disclose her sexual assault allegation until June 2024, months after she began a series of meetings with government prosecutors during their investigation that led to Mr. Combs’s arrest last September. Prosecutors said they met with Mia 28 times over the course of the case.</p><p>“I was still deeply ashamed and wanted to die with this,” Mia said.</p><p>Mr. Steel also asked Mia whether she made her accusation to join “the #MeToo money grab” — a question Mia did not answer because the judge, Arun Subramanian, sustained an objection from the government.</p><p>Mia testified that she obtained a settlement of about $400,000 from Mr. Combs’s company during a mediation when she left Mr. Combs’s employment in 2017, and never mentioned a sexual assault then. </p><p>She has not filed any civil suits against Mr. Combs. When asked whether she wants money from Mr. Combs based on her allegations, she said no, and chuckled.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Steel challenged Mia to explain why, given her accusations, she had sent Mr. Combs a series of warm and affectionate text messages starting in 2018, after she was no longer employed by him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Because I was brainwashed,” she answered.</p><p>She said that it took her time to come forward because when she worked for Mr. Combs, “nobody acted like what was happening to me was wrong.” She testified that she had also been dissuaded from speaking publicly by what she described as a threat by Mr. Combs that he would tell his girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, about their sexual encounters, which she said “made me internalize blame and shame.”</p><p>Over two days, Mr. Steel’s cross-examination of Mia has leaned heavily on text messages and social media posts in which she expressed fondness and admiration for the mogul, both during her employment and after it ended.</p><p>When Mr. Steel asked about a text exchange from 2019, she said she had reached out soon after the death of Kim Porter, the mother of three of Mr. Combs’s children, late in 2018. “I felt horrible for him,” she said.</p><p>Out of the presence of the jury, during a break on Monday morning, Maurene Comey, a prosecutor, complained strongly about Mr. Steel’s cross-examination over the text messages, calling it “humiliating” and inappropriate. She added that she was concerned that the tone of his questioning could deter other victims from testifying in other cases.</p><p>“Mr. Steel has yelled at this witness, Mr. Steel has been sarcastic with this witness,” Ms. Comey told the judge.</p><p>Judge Subramanian disagreed. “I don’t see that this witness has been treated in any improper way at this point,” he said. But he cautioned Mr. Steel not to repeat questions that he has sustained objections over.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mia is the 21st witness in the case, which is entering the fourth week of what is expected to be an eight-week trial.</p><p>The government argues that Mr. Combs was a violent and abusive man who controlled, intimidated and sexually violated women, and that he directed employees to commit arson, bribery, forced labor, obstruction of justice and other crimes on his behalf as part of a “criminal enterprise.”</p><p>The government has accused Mr. Combs of subjecting Mia to forced labor — including sexual activity — through violence and threats of serious harm. That allegation is part of the government’s charge of racketeering conspiracy.</p><p>Among the previous witnesses in the case are Ms. Ventura, the singer known as Cassie, who said she had been coerced intro drug-fueled sex marathons, and a stylist, Deonte Nash, who described witnessing Mr. Combs’s violent attacks on Ms. Ventura. Mr. Nash said Ms. Ventura told him about Mr. Combs’s threats to release explicit videos of her with other men in “freak-offs,” the sexual encounters that are at the heart of the government’s case. Ms. Ventura had called those videos “blackmail materials.”</p><p>The list of the government’s next planned witnesses suggests that the prosecution will further examine the circumstances of freak-offs.</p><p>One witness, Eddy Garcia, was a supervisor at an InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, where a security camera recorded Mr. Combs attacking Ms. Ventura in 2016 — an incident that has been the subject of testimony by multiple witnesses. Mr. Garcia will testify under an immunity order by the court, which he attested to at the start of the proceedings on Monday.</p><p>Frank Piazza, a forensic video expert who examined that hotel footage, is also expected to testify. Other witnesses early this week may include Sylvia Okun, a hotel custodian, and a man named Enrique Santos.</p><p>Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
