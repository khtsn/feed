As part of that work, she provided “24/7” support to her celebrity boss, according to a résumé from the start of Mia’s career that was displayed to jurors.</p><p>Mr. Combs has been charged with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyers have strongly denied that any of his sexual arrangements were nonconsensual, arguing that the women who are part of the government’s case willingly consented to sex with Mr. Combs.</p><p>If convicted of all charges, Mr. Combs, 55, could face life in prison.</p><p>Mia is the 21st witness in the case, which is entering the fourth week of what is expected to be an eight-week trial, with prosecutors still filling out the particulars of a case that charges the music mogul with sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The government arguers that Mr. Combs was a violent and abusive man who controlled, intimidated and sexually violated women, and that he directed employees to commit arson, bribery, forced labor, obstruction of justice and other crimes on his behalf as part of a “criminal enterprise.”</p><p>The witnesses in the case so far have included Casandra Ventura, the singer known as Cassie, who said she had been coerced intro drug-fueled sex marathons, and a former assistant, testifying under the pseudonym “Mia,” who said that her boss sexually assaulted her and subjected her to sleep deprivation and violence.</p><p>Another witness, Deonte Nash, a stylist, described witnessing Mr. Combs’s violent attacks on Ms. Ventura, and said she told him that Mr. Combs had threatened to release explicit videos of her with other men in “freak-offs,” the sexual encounters that are at the heart of the government’s case. Ms. Ventura had called those videos “blackmail materials.”</p><p>At a news conference at the White House on Friday, President Trump said that, if asked, he was open to reviewing a possible pardon for Mr. Combs — whom he crossed paths with decades ago on the celebrity scene in New York — if he was convicted.</p><p>“I would certainly look at the facts,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>Mia, who testified on Thursday and Friday last week, returned to the stand on Monday for what should be the conclusion of her testimony. During the start of her cross-examination on Friday, Mr. Steel showed her dozens of social media posts in which she repeatedly expressed affection and admiration for the music mogul. Mr. Steel asked how she could write such things if he had also abused her in the way she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I was young and manipulated and just eager to survive,” Mia said.</p><p>The next witnesses planned in the trial suggest that the government will further examine the circumstances of freak-offs.</p><p>One witness, Eddy Garcia, was a supervisor at an InterContinential Hotel in Los Angeles, where a security camera recorded Mr. Combs attacking Ms. Ventura in 2016 — an incident that has been the subject of testimony by multiple witnesses in the trial. Mr. Garcia will testify under an immunity order by the court, which he attested to at the start of the proceedings on Monday.</p><p>Frank Piazza, is a forensic video expert who examined that hotel footage, is also expected to testify. Other expected witnesses early this week include Sylvia Okun, a hotel custodian, and a man named Enrique Santos.</p><p>Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
