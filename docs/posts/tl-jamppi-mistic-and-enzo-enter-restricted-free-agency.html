<p>Enzo and Mistic, the former of whom was the team&#39;s in-game leader this past season, have been with the organization since November 2023.</p>

<p>Both of their Valorant careers started in 2020, but their paths would not cross until 2022 when they found themselves as teammates on <span data-ref-id="4">

</span>. Their tenures as players on the team&#39;s active roster ended in September 2022, and they would become teammates once again when Team Liquid signed them both ahead of the 2024 season. </p>

<p>“Willing to IGL, lead and build a team! Can also flex and second IGL,” Enzo <a href="https://x.com/FearothVAL/status/1829592903813132715" target="_blank">said</a> following the announcement. The frenchman also has his sights set on great heights in 2025. “Let&#39;s make it to Champs Paris.”</p>

<p>Team Liquid&#39;s roster overhaul comes following less-than-desirable results in their 2024 season. Their performance was peaked by a 5th-6th place finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1998/champions-tour-2024-emea-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">EMEA Stage 1</a>. It was also the first season that saw the team fail to qualify for an international event.</p>

<p>“Tough year for us so Liquid have allowed me to explore my options as a restricted F/A,” Mistic <a href="https://x.com/misticJK/status/1829591444526633059" target="_blank">said</a> following the announcement.</p>

<p>Jamppi was on the Team Liquid team that won the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1190/champions-tour-2023-emea-league/playoffs" target="_blank">2023 EMEA League</a>. Most known for his initiator play, his 1.16 rating across four maps in the grand final against FNATIC will be fresh in the minds of Liquid fans. </p>

<p>“I&#39;ll never ever forget all the support you all have given me,” Jamppi said following the announcement. “It is still my goal to bring this organization big success.”</p>

<p>Both Mistic and Jamppi stated that they are open to opportunities in NA, EMEA and APAC.</p>
