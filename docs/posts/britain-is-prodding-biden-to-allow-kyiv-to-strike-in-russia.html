Starmer was expected to urge Biden to allow the Ukrainians to fire NATO-provided missiles deep inside Russian territory.</p><p>Getting Biden’s approval on such strikes is critical: the missiles use satellite data and other technology supplied by the U.S. Recent indications suggest that Biden will eventually give his sign off, so long as American weapons are not being fired deep inside Russia.</p><p>Starmer’s push has stoked tensions between London and Russia. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/europe/uk-russia-diplomats.html" title="">Russia expelled six British diplomats today</a>, accusing them of espionage, and Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Western support for Ukrainian strikes in Russia would mean that NATO countries, including the U.S., would be “at war” with Russia.</p><p>American and European officials insist that Ukraine’s efforts to expand its gains on the battlefield — including by using NATO-provided missiles — could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/europe/ukraine-war-blinken-us-lammy.html" title="">encourage Putin to seriously engage in peace negotiations</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>In related news, </strong>the U.S., Canada and Britain accused RT, Russia’s global television network, of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/russia-sanctions-disinformation-rt.html" title="">working on behalf of Russian intelligence agencies</a>.</p><hr/><p>🇺🇸 2024</p><p><em>The presidential election is </em><strong><em>53 days away.</em></strong><em> Here’s the latest from the campaign trail.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Election workers in Phoenix during this year’s presidential primary election.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rebecca Noble for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-78e8d520">Election results could take awhile</h2><p>If you’re planning to host an election night party, you probably won’t be popping champagne by the end of the evening. That’s because it’s quite possible that there will be no clear winner on election night, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/election-night-results-timing.html" title="">early returns could give a false impression of who will ultimately prevail</a>, as was the case in 2020. But that doesn’t necessarily point to failures in the process.</p><p>Large numbers of Americans are expected to cast their ballots by mail, a process that takes more time. Also, states with prolonged vote-counting processes, like Arizona, have become competitive.
