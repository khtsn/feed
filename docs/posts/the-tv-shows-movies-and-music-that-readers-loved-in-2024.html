Stylish, smart, sexy, and, most importantly, such a great time at the movies. As I left the theater, I wanted to do three things: play tennis, go dancing and walk right back inside and watch the movie again. The lead trio all give great, committed performances, and behind the camera, Luca Guadagnino proves once again that he can make any genre of film into a feast for the senses. The feel of sweat dripping down your face, the smell of a fresh tennis ball, the sound of pulsing music, the sight of three gorgeous actors, the taste of a churro — it’s all there.”</p><p>— Hannah Schockmel, Boston</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-299f4446"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/movies/the-outrun-review.html" title="">The Outrun&#39;</a></span></h3><p>“Saoirse Ronan is incandescent and mesmerizing in the role. You cannot look away. I felt every vibration, every sound, every emotion and had to sit in the theater for a few minutes afterward to come back into the world. Gut-wrenching if you’ve ever known a friend or family member in trouble.”</p><p>— Alison MacDonald Duncan, Edinburgh</p><h3 id="link-278c0f0d"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/movies/dune-part-two-review.html" title="">Dune: Part Two’</a></span></h3><p>“Visually amazing representation of one of my favorite books of all time. Denis Villeneuve did the impossible and filmed what many tried and failed, and some said could not ever be accomplished on film. Not only is this my favorite of the year, but it will be an all-time favorite.”</p><p>— Michael Jacobe, Dallas</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h3 id="link-33afb0"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/movies/anora-review.html" title="">Anora&#39;</a></span></h3><p>“So, so, so funny while also being deadly serious. Supremely perfect acting from every single cast member. I was completely sucked in for the entire movie despite it being over two hours long. Beautifully shot. Made me want to learn Russian.”</p><p>— Sarah Garretson, Traverse City, Mich.</p><h3 id="link-3ba3374d"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/movies/my-old-ass-review.html" title="">My Old Ass’</a></span></h3><p>“This beautifully written and acted film delivers all the feels and appeals to both young and old, cynical and romantic. It has a beyond-charismatic heroine; a winsome love interest with a face the camera loves; many LOL moments, pitch-perfect dialogue and reckless situations that make you smile; plus, a third act with a scene-stealing Aubrey Plaza that left this viewer full-on sobbing, rivers of snot running down my face. Its female and supporting characters are fully formed and feel 100% real. Plus: gorgeous Canadian lakes, psychedelic drugs and a magical plot. What more can you ask for from a movie? Nothing.”</p><p>— Lauren Paige Kennedy, Westchester, N.Y.</p><h3 id="link-3d9ab917"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/movies/inside-out-2-review.html" title="">Inside Out 2&#39;</a></span></h3><p>“It’s rare that a movie can convey complex thoughts or a nuanced approach to mental health issues, especially in a movie geared toward a younger audience. Yet, ‘Inside Out 2’ is able to masterfully thread the needle between sharing a message about how life gets more difficult as you grow older, while also being an entertaining and heartwarming story that Pixar is known for. It’s the type of movie that I wish had been around when I was a preteen, and I am glad it exists for the children of today.”</p><p>— Michael Sheridan, New York City</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-5e4e3a28"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/movies/all-of-us-strangers-review.html" title="">All of Us Strangers’</a></span></h3><p>“Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal are two of the best actors we currently have, and watching them together is mesmerizing. This was a subtle, beautiful, heart-wrenching movie that left me feeling devastated when I left the theater. The final scene has repeated in my mind ever since.”</p><p>— Kellyn Kemmerer, Baltimore</p><h3 id="link-3338428c"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/movies/a-real-pain-review-jesse-eisenberg.html" title="">A Real Pain’</a></span></h3><p>“It was a tough choice between this and ‘Anora,’ but for me, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/movies/kieran-culkin-real-pain-succession.html" title="">Kieran Culkin</a>’s performance is just incredible. Jesse Eisenberg was great too, and he did an amazing job directing. For me it was nearly the perfect movie: not too long, focused deeply on characterization while successfully portraying past trauma through behavior and sensibilities of the character in the present. I also loved the score and the setting and the historical themes and parallels.”</p><p>— Carrie Schupack, Philadelphia</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h3 id="link-77325b16"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/movies/la-chimera-review-alice-rohrwacher.html" title="">La Chimera’</a></span></h3><p>“A beautiful, thoughtful journey into love, greed and loss that the magical realism genre supports. I’ve not stopped thinking about the final scene since watching it in theaters this summer.&#34;</p><p>— Dorothea Trufelman, Brooklyn</p><h3 id="link-4ed190b8"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/movies/conclave-review.html" title="">Conclave’</a></span></h3><p>“Started slowly, but built suspense like the best thrillers, and had a crackerjack surprise ending that paid off everything that came before — especially about the church’s appalling attitudes toward women.”</p><p>— Beth Bradley, Canton, Conn.</p><h3 id="link-36b73d"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/movies/queer-review-daniel-craig-luca-guadagnino.html" title="">Queer’</a></span></h3><p>“Director Luca Guadagnino, star <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/movies/daniel-craig-queer.html" title="">Daniel Craig</a>, and writer Justin Kuritzkes craft the ultimate tale of devastating, unsynchronized love. They take William S. Burroughs’s novella and go deeper, darker and stranger. It’s amazing that Guadagnino made this and ‘Challengers’ in the same year. Where that is a perfect pop confection, ‘Queer’ is a dark, harrowing odyssey to the depths of the heart.”</p><p>— Gabriel Frieberg, San Francisco</p><h3 id="link-7404b571"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/movies/sing-sing-review.html" title="">Sing Sing’</a></span></h3><p>“In a year where humanity seemed to be in short supply, ‘Sing Sing’ showcased humanity. A light in the darkness.&#34;</p><p>— Nick Ottone, New York City</p><h3 id="link-5f642f0"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/movies/wicked-review.html" title="">Wicked’</a></span></h3><p>“Unlike most musical adaptations, this one really felt like it was respecting and uplifting the original musical. I also appreciated how Jon Chu really used the form of movies to approach this in a slightly different way than the musical. It felt like the change in media was looking at the story in a new way while still respecting and not looking down on live stage musicals.”</p><p>— Bella Vignola, Bethesda, Md.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h3 id="link-54ca1f33"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/movies/will-and-harper-will-ferrell-harper-steele-netflix.html" title="">Will &amp; Harper’</a></span></h3><p>“You would think there would be a lot of laughs in a road-trip documentary with Will Ferrell and his friend, a ‘Saturday Night Live’ writer who transitions from male to female at age 50-plus. But it’s more a touching story about friendship, celebrity culture and the challenges of being trans.”</p><p>— Jean Petkofsky, Williamsburg, Va.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h3 id="link-35cf96ac"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/theater/maybe-happy-ending-review-darren-criss.html" title="">Maybe Happy Ending’</a></strong></span></h3><p>“The best life-affirming love story I’ve seen onstage this year. And between robots, no less. A pitch-perfect 90 minutes with some of the best writing on Broadway. Most importantly, it is one of the only FULLY original stories on Broadway this year.”</p><p>— Daina Goldenberg, New York City</p><h3 id="link-63feae49"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/theater/review-outsiders-musical.html" title="">The Outsiders&#39;</a></strong></span></h3><p>“The music? Phenomenal. The cast? Perfect. The staging? Jaw dropping. But especially seeing it the week after the election, it reminded me of the stories out there that are often overlooked, and how, sadly, S.E. Hinton’s tale of destructive systems of poverty and toxic masculinity is still urgently relevant today.”</p><p>— Alison Siggard, San Ramon, Calif.</p><h3 id="link-480e1dde"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/theater/cats-the-jellicle-ball-review.html" title="">Cats: The Jellicle Ball’</a></strong></span></h3><p>“The only rendition of ‘Cats’ anyone should ever see. A reimagining of the iconic mega musical toned down (but just as flamboyant) as told through a queer ballroom culture lens has to be one of the most ingenious iterations of this show. Captivating and heartwarming. Shame it didn’t run longer.”</p><p>— Courtney Terr, New York City</p><h3 id="link-5ec9343"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/theater/oh-mary-review-cole-escola.html" title="">Oh, Mary!&#39;</a></strong></span></h3><p>“The new theater of the absurd is a perfect antidote to our post-truth age.”</p><p>— Amy Lemen, Clinton Hollow, N.Y.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h3 id="link-27fe5aa0"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/theater/the-great-gatsby-review-noblezada-jordan.html" title="">The Great Gatsby’</a></strong></span></h3><p>“Semi-embarrassing note that after having read and studied the book in high school and watched the Leonardo DiCaprio movie repeatedly, watching this on Broadway was the first time I truly got the ending.”</p><p>— Julia Brukx, New York City</p><h3 id="link-6746692a"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/theater/yellow-face-review-daniel-dae-kim.html" title="">Yellow Face’</a></strong></span></h3><p>“Somehow this play manages to combine a hilarious satire on identity in the theater with a serious exploration of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States.”</p><p>— Bruce Altschuler, Brooklyn</p><h3 id="link-36bb1e"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/theater/suffs-review-broadway-shaina-taub.html" title="">Suffs’</a></strong></span></h3><p>“‘Suffs’ is brilliant and shows how art can bring truth to power for the public consciousness.

With Will Butler songs built in, David Adjmi’s play chronicles the creative process and the personal turmoil that goes into it. The ensemble is stellar and by the time that the two sound engineers call the album a wrap, we’ve been through quite the harrowing journey.”</p><p>— Chad Frade, Brooklyn</p><h3 id="link-18c103df"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/theater/merrily-we-roll-along-review.html" title="">Merrily We Roll Along’</a></strong></span></h3><p>“‘Merrily’ was sheer perfection. A score that I have always loved with every cast member bringing the songs to life. Jonathan Groff taking a character that is so easy to hate and instead letting us see that even as he makes the wrong choices, we see the pain underneath. Daniel Radcliffe showing us that things aren’t as black and white as he sees them. And Lindsay Mendez desperately trying to mediate and instead, losing herself. The play reminds us that life is full of compromises, and it’s impossible to know if we made the right choices until it’s way too late. This was a night of theater that will stay with me forever.”</p><p>— Robin Bickel, Randolph, N.J.</p><h3 id="link-4951f8dc"><span><strong>‘</strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/10/theater/dead-outlaw-review.html" title="">Dead Outlaw’</a></strong></span></h3><p>“Great music and comedy, and what’s not to love about a show where a dead man travels the country as a sideshow act for the entire second half?

And it’s one of the few shows I’ve seen that gets Kansas exactly right.”</p><p>— Becky Lake, Santa Clarita, Calif.</p><h3 id="link-fcb07b7"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/arts/television/review-english-teacher.html" title="">English Teacher’</a></span></h3><p>“This is one of the best comedies that I have seen in a long time. As a queer high school English teacher myself, I really felt like the show captured the balancing act that is appealing to our Gen Z students while still trying to please their boomer parents. The scenes with the burnt-out principal were real and hilarious, and the relationships between the teachers felt like something that I experience in my everyday life.”</p><p>— Riley Biondi, Chicago</p><h3 id="link-5fc2f99"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/arts/television/ripley-review.html" title="">Ripley’</a></span></h3><p>“I read all the Ripley books four decades ago and never found the film adaptations true to the books. This version captured Ripley’s pathetic, desperate, unglamorous and amoral character. Andrew Scott was strangely still but his face told so much. The cinematography was stunning and the casting was inventive.”</p><p>— Janet Zweig, Brooklyn</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><h3 id="link-153498ef"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/arts/television/true-detective-night-country-review.html" title="">True Detective: Night Country’</a></span></h3><p>“The eerie setting of Alaska during the dark winter, the gripping performances of Jodie Foster and Kali Reis, and the exploration of issues on Indigenous vs. locals, polluting mine vs. local economy, violence against women, and Indigenous spirituality. This woman-led season is the series’ best since Season 1.”</p><p>— K.C.

Listening to her music, you can hear the science of pleasant pop music being brewed straight in the beaker. Usually that puts me off, but I needed it this year.”</p><p>— Kara Ma, Seattle</p><h3 id="link-5cad8ad3"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/arts/music/jon-batiste-beethoven-blues.html" title="">Beethoven Blues’</a> by Jon Batiste</span></h3><p>“The music is incredible.

This version features artists like Post Malone and Gracie Abrams and Hozier and plenty more. This album speaks to us northern dwellers like no other album I’ve found. Noah explores themes of suicide and addiction and even heavy snowfall. There are so many things to get from this album; there just aren’t enough listens to get all the album has to offer.”</p><p>— Fallon Pawley, Farmington Hills, Mich.</p><h3 id="link-e0fa692"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/arts/music/amplifier-newsletter-no-1-songs-2024.html" title="">Megan’</a> by Megan Thee Stallion</span></h3><p>“By far my most-listened-to album this year, we see what Megan can do when not attached to a restricting label. She’s a delightful mix of sharp, poignant and vulnerable. While possibly not her best work (‘Traumazine’ was my favorite of hers), Megan proves to be the next great female rapper of our generation.”</p><p>— Tyler Streuber, Las Vegas</p><h3 id="link-77c6dedb"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/arts/music/taylor-swift-kendrick-lamar-dua-lipa-billboard-charts.html" title="">Euphoria’</a> by Kendrick Lamar</span></h3><p>“‘Not Like Us’ got all of the attention, but ‘Euphoria’ was what caused the simmering pan to catch fire. It’s brilliant, it’s devastating, it is my favorite song from this year without question.”</p><p>— Rick Cummings, San Francisco</p><h3 id="link-50e48568"><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/arts/music/taylor-swift-album-tortured-poets-department-review.html" title="">‘The Tortured Poets Department’</a> by Taylor Swift</span></h3><p>“I can’t help it. I’m a huge fan and loved how it felt like she wrote this one for herself. Also again, the rage. It’s impossible to not connect with a woman’s anger, as a woman, right now.”</p><p>— Meg Pickarski, New York City</p><h3 id="link-722201e0"><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/magazine/jelly-roll-interview.html" title="">‘Beautifully Broken (Pickin’ Up the Pieces)’</a> by Jelly Roll</span></h3><p>“Jelly Roll’s a great crossover artist, lacking the nasal country twang and heavy reliance on bars, pickup trucks and girls in cutoffs. His melodies are pop, alt-rock, blues or a mélange thereof. This album reminds me of a longtime addict friend who tells me he’s clean and I don’t believe him. I don’t say so, but this album really points out the facets of addiction and how difficult it is to escape its clutches. The topic sounds depressing, but the lyrics and melodies are anything but.”</p><p>— Susan Zoske, Paris</p><h3 id="link-61bc7e41"><span>‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/arts/music/chappell-roan-live-fans.html" title="">Good Luck, Babe!’</a> by Chappell Roan</span></h3><p>“The pulsating pop-synth beats combined with Roan’s passionate vocals made this the song of the summer and year as a whole.&#34;</p><p>— Mark Weaver, Pittsburgh</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><p>Shivani Gonzalez<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
