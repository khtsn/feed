Choi Sang-mok, the finance minister, was named the new acting president.</p><p>The parliamentary vote on Dec. 27 over Mr. Han was the first time in South Korean history that an acting president had been impeached. </p><p>Like Mr. Han, Mr. Choi is not an elected official. He is leading South Korea with no real political heft as the country faces challenges like North Korea’s growing nuclear threat and the return of Donald J. Trump to the White House.</p><p>Mr. Yoon, meanwhile, has vowed to fight in court to regain his power.</p><p>In a recorded speech released shortly after his impeachment, Mr. Yoon listed what he considered his accomplishments as president, including his efforts to strengthen military ties with the United States and Japan.
