Lotto Texas had a relatively low number of possible ticket combinations, around 25.8 million number mixes, and a low price per ticket, $1. (In comparison, the odds of the Powerball are about one in 300 million.) Buying them all could be worth it for a large enough jackpot.</p><p>Crucially, state regulators, looking to increase sales, had become permissive of companies that helped remote players buy tickets, known as “lottery couriers.”</p><p>Still, executives at Lottery.com — <a href="https://ir.lottery.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an internet start-up founded</a> to help players get access to lottery tickets around the world — were leery when European bettors came with their proposal to buy nearly all the tickets. They asked the state for permission before agreeing to take part.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We were very surprised when the answer was yes,” Greg Potts, a Lottery.com executive, would later say at a State Senate hearing.</p><p>Before jumping in, they watched the lottery jackpot grow slowly but steadily in early 2023 as one draw after another failed to produce a winner. The draws, three times a week, brought only modest interest from lottery players, who bought around one or two million tickets on each draw.</p><p>The bettors saw their chance, and their intervention showed in the jackpot, which rose from around $74 million to $95 million in a matter of days, as millions of additional tickets were sold.</p><p>Dawn Nettles, a longtime lottery player who publishes a website on the Texas lottery, understood there hadn’t been a sudden burst of enthusiasm from ordinary Texans. Someone was buying all the tickets.</p><p>“More than likely, there will be a winner tonight,” she <a href="https://lottoreport.com/2updates.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on her site</a> in late April 2023.</p><p>And there was.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Texas Lottery Commission heralded the win, the third largest in state history, which helped raise around $50 million for the state’s public schools out of $138 million in sales over the life of the jackpot run.</p><p>Gary Grief, the commission’s executive director at the time, acknowledged <a href="https://www.texaslottery.com/export/sites/lottery/Documents/news_releases/2023/04-25-23_Colleyville_Lotto_Texas_Press_Release.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a news release</a> that “purchasing groups” had stepped in, ensuring that more than 99 percent of the number combinations had been sold. There is “no prohibition on these types of purchases,” he added.</p><p>The winning ticket had been sold at a store in the Dallas suburb of Colleyville, operated by a company called Lottery Now.</p><p>But it wasn’t the usual convenience store where lottery tickets are sold. It was a storefront office packed with more than a dozen lottery terminals, used to pick lottery numbers and print tickets. And the winner came forward anonymously: a recently formed Delaware-based company named Rook TX.</p><p>The Colleyville storefront alone had printed nearly $11 million worth of $1 tickets in the span of 72 hours, about four a second. (Each ticket can have up to 10 plays on it.) Three other storefronts printed another $14.8 million worth with the same speed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For years, the commission had welcomed couriers as an efficient way to boost revenue, even though state law had been crafted to require in-person purchases. <a href="https://www.sunset.texas.gov/public/uploads/2025-01/Texas%20Lottery%20Commission%20Staff%20Evaluation_01-07-25.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A state audit observed that</a> Mr. Grief “seemed quite comfortable operating in the gray areas.”</p><p>Republican leaders, including the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, now see couriers as scofflaws.

The firm’s founder, Bernard Marantelli, also started Colossus Bets with Zeljko Ranogajec, a wealthy Australian and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5885445/Inside-private-life-Zeljko-Ranogajec-worlds-biggest-gambler.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">famed professional gambler</a> who also goes by John Wilson.

Half went to two locations connected to Lottery.com, whose former president had been ousted months earlier over improper ticket sales.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The job of getting all those terminals to rapidly print millions of tickets initially fell to Brandon Marsh, the head of product for Lottery.com at the time. Then, a day after he got the assignment, Mr. Marsh said he was told not to worry, the ticket buyer would provide a system to generate and enter the combinations, and the staff members, some from overseas, to print and organize the tickets.</p><p>When no one claimed the draw on April 19, 2023, they launched, with three days to pull it off before the next draw.</p><p>“It was a crazy 72 hours,” Mr. Potts, the Lottery.com executive, wrote in an email a day after the winning draw.</p><p>“I can only imagine the atmosphere was electrifying,” another company leader responded.</p><p>The company appeared to make about $260,000 for its part in the deal.</p><p>After finding the winning ticket, a group involved in the buy, including people from White Swan Data and Lottery.com, celebrated with cigars and drinks at an Austin bar called Swan Dive — just a few blocks from the Texas Capitol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>It worked so well that a few days later, Mr. Potts said Lottery.com was asked if they could help pull off a similar buy in Tennessee, according to a recording of a company discussion reviewed by The Times.</p><p>But the company had to decline, Mr. Potts said. Lottery.com didn’t operate in Tennessee, and officials in that state “wouldn’t just drop off machines.”</p><p>Glenn Gelband, a lawyer representing Rook TX, Mr. Marantelli and Mr. Ranogajec, said “all applicable laws, rules and regulations were followed.” </p><h2 id="link-6175bd91">How the caper came to light</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lottery.com purchased John Brier’s lottery-data business.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zack Wittman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>For nearly two years, John Brier, a Tampa, Fla., businessman, had been talking to anyone who would listen about the 2023 Texas lottery win and its connection to Lottery.com, which had purchased Mr. Brier’s lottery-data business and, he said, refused to fully pay for it.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He had sued the company a few weeks before the Texas draw.
