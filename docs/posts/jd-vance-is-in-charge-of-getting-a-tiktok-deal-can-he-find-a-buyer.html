TikTok was recently banned in the United States under a new federal law that prohibited distribution in the country if it was not sold to a non-Chinese owner, though Mr. Trump delayed enforcement of the law until early April.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s assignment plunges Mr. Vance into a fraught geopolitical and corporate negotiation over the fate of the app, which counts some 170 million American users. It is not clear who could buy TikTok in the United States, or even whether China or ByteDance, TikTok’s owner, would allow a sale. And the Trump administration is under scrutiny for its decision to disregard the law’s Jan. 19 deadline for a sale or a ban. </p><p>Mr. Vance’s involvement ensures that he and Mr. Trump — both of whom once supported banning TikTok because of national security concerns — have some public accountability for saving it, according to analysts and people involved in negotiations for a sale. Tapping Mr. Vance could also help lend negotiations more credibility, said Peter Harrell, a former Biden White House official who worked on national security, tech and economic issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“What he brings to the role is everybody’s going to take his call and take him seriously,” Mr. Harrell said. “Most people, given Trump has been pretty clear he’s tapped Vance for this, will assume that Vance is speaking for the president.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An electronic billboard for TikTok in Times Square.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Vance, Taylor Van Kirk, said in a statement that “President Trump and Vice President Vance are committed to preserving free speech and continuing access to TikTok, while ensuring Americans’ data is protected from any kind of security threat.”</p><p>TikTok didn’t return a request for comment.</p><p>On Thursday, Apple and Google <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/technology/tiktok-apple-google-app-stores.html" title="">restored TikTok</a> to their U.S. app stores after receiving letters from the Justice Department assuring them that they would not face fines for carrying TikTok in their app stores.</p><p>Mr. Vance worked as a junior venture capitalist and a biotech executive for more than five years, including at Mithril Capital, founded by Peter Thiel, an early Silicon Valley backer of President Trump. That experience helped him forge connections with other influential tech executives and investors like David Sacks, now the White House czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, and the billionaire Elon Musk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“He cares deeply about national security, so I believe that with TikTok, he will ensure that Americans’ personal data stops being fed to an authoritarian adversary,” said Crystal McKellar, a venture capitalist who worked with Mr. Vance at Mithril Capital, in a text message.</p><p>Mr. Vance, who invested alongside Mr. Thiel in Rumble, a YouTube rival for conservatives, has also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/jd-vance-on-big-tech/77769E96-70F5-45B6-8483-A7158C78A4D8?mod=tech_videos_pos1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed distrust</a> of bigger technology companies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People wait to hear arguments in a Supreme Court case challenging the law banning TikTok in the United States unless it was sold to a non-Chinese owner.

Helping TikTok survive “would certainly align with Vance’s personal philosophy on Big Tech.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Vance faces a tall task to come up with a deal for TikTok. The last Trump administration official who led an effort to negotiate a deal for TikTok, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who previously worked as a Goldman Sachs banker, couldn’t ultimately finalize anything.</p><p>The aide for Mr. Vance who reached out to Mr. McCourt wanted formal documents that explained his bid, which is an offer to buy the app without its coveted algorithm. Mr. McCourt submitted them last week, the people familiar with the process said. The spokeswoman for Mr. Vance did not reply to a request for comment on his office’s engagement with Mr. McCourt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The billionaire Frank McCourt has offered around $20 billion for TikTok, with the aim of changing how the app currently handles users’ data and privacy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cindy Ord/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Jesse Tinsley, the founder of payroll firm Employer.com, has submitted a similar bid to buy the app without the algorithm. His offer, which includes a consortium of investors like the chief executive of Roblox, the video game platform, is for ”more than $30 billion,” he said in an interview. He said his group plans to “recreate the algorithm or something similar with our own team.”</p><p>Mr. Tinsley has received commitments for the money from other investors, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds, and was also “open to President Trump’s new U.S. sovereign wealth fund,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But there hasn’t been much dialogue just yet.</p><p>“We have not heard back from TikTok or ByteDance,” Mr. Tinsley said. “This whole process is unique in the sense that it’s not a normal M&amp;A process.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lauren Hirsch covers Wall Street, including M&amp;A, executive changes, board strife and policy moves affecting business.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lauren-hirsch">More about Lauren Hirsch</a></span></p></div><div><p>David McCabe is a Times reporter who covers the complex legal and policy issues created by the digital economy and new technologies.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-mccabe">More about David McCabe</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
