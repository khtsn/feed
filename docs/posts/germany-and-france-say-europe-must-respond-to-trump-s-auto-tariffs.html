The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/business/trump-tariffs-european-union.html" title="">tariffs</a>, which he said were permanent, will take effect next Thursday.</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron of France said Thursday that he had told Mr. Trump the day before that tariffs were “not a good idea.” France would work with the European Commission on a “riposte,” he added, the goal of which would be “to find an accord to dismantle the tariffs” and getting the U.S. president to “reconsider.”</p><p>In Germany, whose auto industry is a huge exporter to the United States and faces a blow, the economy minister, Robert Habeck, said it was “crucial that the E.U. delivers a decisive response to the tariffs,” adding: “It must be clear that we will not back down.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called Mr. Trump’s tariff decision “wrong.” “The U.S. is thus embarking on a path that will only end with losers,” he said. “Because tariffs and isolation cost prosperity for everyone.”</p><p>The American market is crucial for Germany’s biggest automakers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/europe/volkswagen-tariffs-competition.html" title="">Volkswagen</a>. German automakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/business/trump-germany-cars-tariffs.html" title="">long been a target</a> of Mr. Trump’s ire.</p><p>Both Mr. Habeck and Mr. Macron warned that the tariffs would hit growth and supply chains on both sides of the Atlantic and fan inflationary pressures in the United States. Mr. Macron added that the U.S. stock market had sent a clear signal that “it’s not good economic policy.”</p><p>The announcements “are bad news for German automakers, for the German economy, for the E.U., but also for the U.S.,” Mr. Habeck said. He added that Germany would support the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, as it negotiated with the United States to find a solution that averted a tariff spiral.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s announcement, which will apply to auto parts and finished vehicles that are shipped to the United States, sent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/auto-trump-tariffs-stocks-futures.html" title="">shares of German automakers</a> tumbling on Thursday. Shares of the Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari and the Swedish manufacturer Volvo also slumped. The rout encompassed European auto parts makers as well as the tire producers Pirelli and Continental.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>BMW said in a statement Thursday that a trade war “would not have any benefits,” and called on the European Union and the United States to “promptly find a trans-Atlantic deal that creates growth and prevents a spiral of isolation and trade barriers.”</p><p>BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen vehicles constitute <a href="https://www.jato.com/resources/media-and-press-releases/trump-tariffs-would-impact-nearly-20-percent-of-cars-sales-in-the-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 73 percent</a> of the European Union’s automotive exports to the United States, according to <a href="https://www.jato.com/resources/media-and-press-releases/trump-tariffs-would-impact-nearly-20-percent-of-cars-sales-in-the-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report</a> from JATO Dynamics, a research firm.</p><p>Mexico is the largest country of origin for vehicles made by Volkswagen, Europe’s largest car manufacturer, JATO said in the report. But the European Union is the largest source for Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the United States.</p><p>The prospect of a drawn-out trade war would have wide-ranging effects. “The impacts of this move are clearly detrimental, and are likely to trigger further and fresh retaliatory actions by affected nations,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note to clients.</p><p>Automakers have the choice of absorbing the cost of the tariffs or passing them on to consumers, the analysts noted. Prices could rise up to $12,000 per car, and “the resulting inflation could pressure the Trump administration into backing down,” they wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Porsche, a unit of Volkswagen, imports all of its vehicles sold in the United States and would be more sensitive to tariffs than its European counterparts, analysts at Barclays said in a research note this month before the tariffs were announced.</p><p>But tariffs would have little affect on the bottom line of a luxury brand like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/business/ferrari-electric-vehicles.html" title="">Ferrari</a>, which manufactures all of its cars at its factory in Maranello, Italy. The automaker said Thursday that it would <a href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corporate/articles/ferrari-commercial-policy-update" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raise the price</a> of certain models up to 10 percent to offset the cost of the tariffs.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s tariffs are hitting the European auto industry at a time when it is facing a transformation and increased international competition, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said in a statement.</p><p>“European automakers have been investing in the U.S. for decades, creating jobs, fostering economic growth in local communities and generating massive tax revenue for the U.S. government,” said the group’s director general, Sigrid de Vries. “We urge President Trump to consider the negative impact of tariffs not only on global automakers but on U.S. domestic manufacturing as well.”</p><p>Hildegard Müller, the president of the German lobby group VDA, called the tariffs “a fatal signal for free and rules-based trade.”</p><p>“The risk of a global trade war, with negative consequences for the world economy and growth, prosperity, jobs and consumer prices, is very high,” Ms. Müller said in a statement.</p><p>Melissa Eddy<!-- --> contributed reporting from Berlin.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liz Alderman is the chief European business correspondent, writing about economic, social and policy developments around Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liz-alderman">More about Liz Alderman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
