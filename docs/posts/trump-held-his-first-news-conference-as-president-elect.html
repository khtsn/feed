    <h1>Trump Held His First News Conference as President-Elect</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Donald Trump invited reporters to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida today for his first news conference since the election. The president-elect spent nearly half an hour <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/politics/trump-drones-border-autism.html" title="">jumping from one topic to another</a>, including border security, tax cuts and the war in Ukraine, before taking questions.</p><p>The event was in many ways reminiscent of Trump’s first term, when he relished seizing the world’s attention. Trump said Ukraine should be ready to make a deal, cited debunked data linking vaccines and autism, threatened more lawsuits against media companies and accused the Biden administration of hiding the truth about recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/nyregion/drones-nj-ny-east-coast.html" title="">drone sightings</a>. We <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/politics/trump-news-conference-fact-check.html" title="">fact-checked the event</a>.</p><p>Trump said he would consider pardoning Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, and claimed that Elon Musk would be able to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget with “no impact on people.” He also announced that SoftBank, the Japanese tech investment giant, plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/trump-softbank-investment.html" title="">inject $100 billion in American projects</a>, likely to be focused on the infrastructure needed to support the A.I. boom.</p><p>At one point, Trump suggested that he was being treated better than last time he was elected. “The first term, everybody was fighting me,” he said. “In this term, everybody wants to be my friend. I don’t know — my personality changed or something.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wis., after a shooting today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Morry Gash/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-27340416">Two people killed in a Wisconsin school shooting</h2><p>A teenage student opened fire this morning at a Christian school in Madison, Wis., killing one student and one teacher, the authorities said.

He went back inside, where he was invited onstage to perform with a bluegrass duo. That chance encounter led to the creation of what might be the unlikeliest holiday hit: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/style/grandma-got-run-over-christmas-song-history.html" title="">“Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer.”</a></p><p>The tune — written by Brooks and released by Elmo &amp; Patsy, the duo he met that night — hit No. 1 on a Billboard holiday chart in 1983.
