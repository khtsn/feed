    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>After Rwanda-backed rebels seized the Congolese city of Goma in 2012, powerful nations across the world registered their disapproval, announcing sanctions against Rwanda and other measures that led to the rebels’ defeat a year later.</p><p>When those same rebels battled to capture Goma on Sunday, several nations once again voiced their criticism, but they have yet to apply the level of pressure on Rwanda that eventually led the rebels to stand down more than a decade ago.</p><p>As hundreds of thousands of civilians fled escalating violence in recent days, seeking sanctuary in Goma, the rebel group M23 was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2025/01/27/world/africa/photos-rebels-goma-congo" title="">right behind them</a>. M23, which the United Nations and others say is funded and armed by Rwanda, declared that it had captured Goma early on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Now, with the fate of the city in the balance, analysts say a conflict that could be tamed with strong international pressure against Rwanda is, instead, spiraling out of control. Rwanda has as many as 4,000 troops in eastern Congo supporting the M23 advance, United Nations experts say. The government of Paul Kagame, Rwanda’s president, appears intent on rewriting Congo’s map by seizing land, and so far, beyond issuing reproofs, Western countries have barely mustered a response.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Kagame has denied that Rwanda is arming M23, or that his troops are in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He says M23 is simply defending the rights of Congo’s minority Tutsis — Mr. Kagame’s own ethnic group, which was the principal target of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. Most analysts say that this is a pretext to occupy Congolese territory and plunder its vast mineral wealth.</p><p>In a call with President Felix Tshisekedi of Congo on Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “condemned the assault on Goma by the Rwanda-backed M23 and affirmed the United States’ respect for the sovereignty of the DRC,” according to the State Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/28/multimedia/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/28/multimedia/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/28/multimedia/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Soldiers walk on the side of a road in a rural area." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/28/multimedia/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/28/multimedia/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/28/multimedia/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/28/multimedia/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw/28congo-rwanda-assess-2-pvgw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/8ef5e18a-667a-54d1-ac6d-2d7597622414" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo west of Goma on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guerchom Ndebo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The United Kingdom and France had earlier condemned Rwanda’s presence in eastern Congo.

The European Union signed a strategic minerals deal with Rwanda last year, prompting <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-rwanda-minerals-agreement-coltan-ore-mining-conflict-smuggling-rubaya-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-paul-kagame/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accusations from rights groups that it is fueling the conflict</a>.</p><p>Rwanda, with a population of just 14 million people, <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/troop-and-police-contributors" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">currently contributes</a> the second-highest number of peacekeepers to the United Nations. Starting in 2021, its troops beat back a jihadist insurgency in an area of Mozambique where a French oil giant has a $20 billion gas project. Rwanda has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/europe/uk-rwanda-policy-explained.html" title="">shown</a> a <a href="https://www.diis.dk/en/event/offshoring-refugees-to-rwanda-a-new-era-europes-anti-refugee-policies" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">willingness</a> to take asylum seekers from Europe, offering to help tackle an issue that has fueled that continent’s far right movements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>And for years, Rwanda has been seen by Western donors as the textbook example of how to get aid right, using the aid to leverage economic growth and development while styling itself the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/02/africas-singapore-dream-rwanda-kagame-lee-kuan-yew/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Singapore of Africa</a>.</p><p>“Powerful Western countries have for long been reticent about punishing Rwanda, which cultivated a reputation as a donor darling,” said Dino Mahtani, a former adviser to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo. “While some are now finally demanding Kagame pull back support to M23, they are unlikely to take action against what they see as the military solution against jihadis in Mozambique.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Congo, on the other hand, has regularly been written off as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/13/world/africa/un-pleads-for-aid-to-save-lives-in-congo.html" title="">hopeless case</a>, a <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2023/01/31/the-democratic-republic-of-congo-a-helpless-giant-against-rwandan-interference_6013762_23.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helpless giant</a> in Africa wracked by a series of wars, rife with corruption and suffering.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A displaced family from Sake, where they were injured by shrapnel, at Ndosho Hospital in Goma, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guerchom Ndebo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>And the suffering is overwhelming.</p><p>Holding a tiny baby and trying to keep her other children close, Sifa Kigugo arrived in Goma on Sunday, just before the rebel takeover, with nowhere to go.

But humanitarian workers warn that the actions of the new Trump administration could plunge the country deeper into crisis. After taking office, President Trump issued an executive order directing a 90-day freeze on almost all foreign aid, pending a review. Last year 68.8 percent of <a href="https://fts.unocha.org/countries/52/summary/2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all humanitarian aid</a> in Congo came from the United States.</p><p>It is also Rwanda’s <a href="https://www.foreignassistance.gov/cd/rwanda/2021/obligations/0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">biggest bilateral donor</a>, giving over $188 million to the country in 2023. Now that aid has been paused, the U.S. may be in a weaker position to influence Rwanda, according to some analysts.</p><p>In 2012, in the wake of M23’s first occupation of Goma, President Barack Obama <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/12/18/readout-president-s-call-president-kagame" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called Mr. Kagame</a> and urged him to stop supporting the rebels.</p><p>More recently, Western nations have taken some action against M23: In 2023, the United States and the European Union <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/28/us-sanctions-rights-abusers-eastern-congo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imposed</a> sanctions on a few Rwandan and Congolese military commanders involved in the conflict, and the United States <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/323896/us-suspends-military-aid-to-rwanda-over-support-for-m23-rebels-in-drc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended</a> military aid to Rwanda last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>On Tuesday, Germany’s development ministry suspended aid talks with Rwandan officials. But many Congolese, including protesters in multiple cities this week, say the E.U. and the United States need to do more to stop Mr. Kagame.</p><p>Rwanda’s exploitation of Congo’s rare minerals has been detailed in multiple reports from the United Nations. Last year, M23 seized an area around the Congolese town of Rubaya that is rich in coltan, an ore used in cellphones and computers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the M23 armed rebel group walk alongside residents in Goma on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>U.N. experts said in December that at least 150 tons of coltan were illegally exported to Rwanda and mixed with Rwandan production. Last month Congo filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium against subsidiaries of Apple, accusing it of using conflict minerals sourced in Congo.</p><p>Analysts say M23, under Rwanda’s guidance, is looking to occupy Congo for the long term, behaving in ways that suggests it plans to establish an administrative state, collecting taxes and imposing fines on residents. “This seems to be a long game of territorial acquisition,” said Mr. Mahtani, the former adviser to the U.N. peacekeeping mission.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>In Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, on Tuesday, anti-Rwanda protesters attacked several foreign embassies and a United Nations building in an eruption of anger at Congo’s allies for failing to stop M23’s advance. Protests also broke out in Bukavu, a larger city to Goma’s south to which some Congolese officers are thought to have fled.
