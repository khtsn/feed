Trump that is essentially tied, Ms. Harris is looking for any possible advantage — including, perhaps, showing the country that she can take a joke. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/us/politics/harris-trump-georgia-north-carolina-virginia.html" title="">spent Saturday campaigning</a> in the battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina and was expected to fly to Michigan when Air Force Two diverted without notice to New York City.</p><p>One of the most popular recurring features on “Saturday Night Live” is having actors portray presidents and presidential candidates. The comedian Maya Rudolph has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/kamala-harris-maya-rudolph.html" title="">played Ms. Harris to much acclaim</a>. Even the vice president has praised her impression. “She’s so good,” Ms. Harris said last month on the ABC talk show “The View,” adding, “She had the whole thing — the suit, the jewelry, everything.”</p><p>Appearing on live television is a gamble for a presidential candidate, or any celebrity without acting experience, but previous contenders have rolled the dice, including Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2015 and Barack Obama in 2007. (Mrs. Clinton also appeared in<strong> </strong>2008.) Few have done so in the waning days of a campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 2015, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton both joined the show during their parties’ primary races. While some politicians make brief cameos, Mr. Trump — who, as the former host of “The Apprentice,” has significant show-business experience — hosted an entire episode, although the sketches were tame and not seen as particularly hilarious.</p><p>Mrs. Clinton appeared in a single sketch, as a bartender serving the version of herself played by the actress Kate McKinnon, and poked gentle — but toothless — fun at herself.</p><p>“Saturday Night Live” airs on NBC at 11:30 p.m.</p><p>Michael Levenson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Times political reporter covering the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
