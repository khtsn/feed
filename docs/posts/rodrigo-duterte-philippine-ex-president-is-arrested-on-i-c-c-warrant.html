    <h1>Rodrigo Duterte, Philippine Ex-President, Is Arrested on I.C.C. Warrant</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was arrested on Tuesday in Manila, after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity in his war on drugs in which, human rights groups say, tens of thousands of Filipinos were summarily executed.</p><p>He was taken into custody at the airport in Manila after returning from a trip to Hong Kong, according to the Philippine government.</p><p>Mr. Duterte, 79, who left office in 2022, is a populist firebrand who remains one of the Philippinesâ€™ most influential politicians, and he has enjoyed relative immunity despite several accusations against him. Only a handful of people have been convicted in connection with the killings.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p><p>Marlise Simons<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris.</p></div></div>
