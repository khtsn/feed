The fires had burned over 88,000 acres of land, the biggest on record in South Korea, according to the Interior Ministry. The largest blaze in Euiseong County was only about halfway contained on Thursday. </p><p>Rescue crews were also focusing on saving as many relics and heritage buildings as possible after two 1,000-year-old Buddhist temples burned to the ground. Around two dozen buildings, trees, statues and other things with national heritage status have been lost to the flames so far, according to the Korea Heritage Service, the government body responsible for the conservation of national treasures and sites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Gounsa Temple in Euiseong County, the main temple building survived the wildfire while surrounding buildings were destroyed as the wildfire swept through on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A statue of a seated Buddha from the early 9th century that was reduced to ashes.

The southeastern region is home to a large proportion of the more than 4,000 items on the country’s national heritage list.</p><p>In the city of Andong, firefighters and officials worked to protect UNESCO Heritage sites as the inferno threatened to spread to those locations. In the 600-year-old Hahoe folk village, firefighters hosed buildings as helicopters dropped buckets of water from above. Workers relocated signage from the Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy, a tourist attraction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A firefighter protecting Hahoe Village, a UNESCO cultural heritage site, from the wildfire in Andong City.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>While the government has successfully evacuated tens of thousands of residents across at least eight cities and counties, thousands of others have stayed behind. Many remained to protect their homes, businesses, livestock and pets. Local residents pleaded with firefighters to put out fires near their houses or restaurants. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>One Andong resident said he and his wife were at home when their house caught fire. They had tried, but failed, to stop the fire by dousing it with water and were forced to evacuate. But they wanted to stay close to their house to protect their 22 cows, which survived, so they have been sleeping inside their car since Tuesday. </p><p>Earlier this week, strong winds kept helicopters and drones grounded, officials said. One pilot died when a helicopter crashed while fighting the fire, though officials have not disclosed the cause. Smoke and smog decreased road and air visibility, making driving and flying near impossible. The Interior Ministry said a lawn mower had started the first of the fires on Friday. </p><p>Conditions had improved by Thursday, and over 100 helicopters were deployed to the missions, according to the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters. At least one U.S. military helicopter joined the effort, the government said.</p><p>Emergency workers and residents are hoping the weather may turn in their favor, with light rain forecast for Thursday by the country’s meteorological agency. Government officials said this would do little to help put out the fires but could weaken the further spread of the flames.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evacuees from villages affected by the wildfires resting at Sinsung Public School in Andong city on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div><div><p>Chang W.
