In the 600-year-old Hahoe folk village, firefighters hosed buildings as helicopters dropped buckets of water from above. Workers relocated signage from the Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy, a tourist attraction.</p><p>While the government has successfully evacuated tens of thousands of residents across at least eight cities and counties, thousands of others have stayed behind. Many remained to protect their homes, businesses, livestock and pets. Local residents pleaded with firefighters to put out fires near their houses or restaurants. </p><p>One Andong resident said he and his wife were at home when their house caught fire. They had tried, but failed, to stop the fire by dousing it with water and were forced to evacuate. But they wanted to stay close to their house to protect their 22 cows, which survived, so they have been sleeping inside their car since Tuesday. </p><p>Earlier this week, strong winds kept helicopters and drones grounded, officials said. One pilot died when a helicopter crashed while fighting the fire, though officials have not disclosed the cause. Smoke and smog decreased road and air visibility, making driving and flying nearly impossible. The Interior Ministry said a lawn mower had started the first of the fires on Friday. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evacuees from villages affected by the wildfires resting at Andong Yongsang Elementary School on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.
