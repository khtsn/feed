But they diverged significantly over the causes of the war, each side’s role in the conflict and its possible resolution.</p><p>The session came as the United States and France split sharply at the United Nations over a resolution condemning Russia’s aggression. While Europe and most of the world sided with Ukraine, the Trump administration dissented along with Russia, North Korea and Belarus, putting the United States in a camp that it has rarely if ever been in over the history of the United Nations.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/world/europe/france-uk-trump-macron-starmer.html" title="">deepening divide</a> was on display in capitals on both sides of the Atlantic. While the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and European Union buildings in Brussels were illuminated with the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag in solidarity, the White House made no effort to demonstrate support. While many world leaders made the trek to Kyiv to stand with Ukrainian leaders, Mr. Trump focused on sealing a deal to claim the country’s natural resources as recompense for military aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I think a lot of progress has been made,” Mr. Trump said of his efforts to negotiate peace with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “We’ve had some very good talks with Russia. We’ve had some very good talks with others, and we’re trying to get the war ended with Russia and Ukraine.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also said that he might go to Moscow if a peace deal were reached, which he predicted could happen within weeks. That would make him the first American president to visit Russia in more than a decade and would be seen as a boon for Mr. Putin, who faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes.</p><p>But even as Mr. Macron called the president “dear Donald” and repeatedly used words like “friendship” and “shared agenda,” he gently and politely struck a different note from Mr. Trump’s on the war.</p><p>“This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,” the French president said during a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House. “It must not mean a cease-fire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty.”</p><p>Mr. Trump made no mention of guarantees or Ukrainian sovereignty, refused to call Mr. Putin a dictator and falsely stated that the United States had spent three times as much on the war as Europe had. Mr. Macron, careful not to provoke Mr. Trump, made clear that Russia was to blame for the war, not Ukraine, and corrected the president’s assertions about European aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office before their news conference, Mr. Trump, who last week said that Ukraine had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-zelensky-ukraine-comments.html" title="">“started”</a> the war and called the country’s popularly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-trump-russia-war.html" title="">“dictator without elections,”</a> declined to use the term for Mr. Putin, who has ruled as an autocrat for a quarter-century. “I don’t use those words lightly,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>Mr. Macron, by contrast, gave voice to the consensus view in Europe and, until now, in the United States that Moscow is to blame for the war. “This is a responsibility of Russia because the aggressor is Russia,” the French president said.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Trump repeated the false claim that the United States had spent $350 billion to aid Ukraine and “had nothing to show for it,” while Europe had spent only $100 billion. In fact, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Europe has allocated $138 billion to the war effort, compared with the $119 billion given by the United States.</p><p>Mr. Trump also mischaracterized the nature of European aid. “Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine,” he said. “They get their money back.”</p><p>Mr. Macron, who earlier in the meeting had been speaking in French through an interpreter, <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1894098479859077345" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quickly interjected in English</a> and put his hand on Mr. Trump’s arm to correct him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“No, in fact, to be frank, we paid,” Mr. Macron said. As in the case of the United States, he said, there has been a mix of grants, loans and loan guarantees. “We provided real money, to be clear,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump, smiling, made a skeptical face and waved his hand as if to say that he did not buy it.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-promise-ending-ukraine-war.html" title="">failed to broker an end to the war</a> in 24 hours or before his inauguration, as he had promised to do on the campaign trail, said that talks he had started with Mr. Putin could end the war “within weeks, if we’re smart.” He added, “If we’re not smart, it will keep going and we will lose young, beautiful people.”</p><p>The president emphasized his demand that Ukraine sign over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/world/europe/ukraine-trump-mineral-deal.html" title="">hundreds of billions of dollars in mineral rights</a> to repay U.S. military aid, which Mr. Zelensky has resisted. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, however, said U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators were “very close” to a deal, at the “one-yard line,” and Mr. Trump said that Mr. Zelensky could come to Washington to sign it as soon as this week or the next.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s return to power is convulsing relations with European allies as he threatens to impose tariffs on their consumer goods, demands that they increase military spending even beyond a previous target and breaks with them over Ukraine. Relations were inflamed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/vance-europe-immigration-ukraine.html" title="">a speech in Munich by Vice President JD Vance</a>, who suggested that the biggest security threat to European nations was not Russia or China, but their own political and cultural policies.</p><p>Mr. Macron has organized two meetings of European leaders to formulate a plan for dealing with an America that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html" title="">appears to be shifting favor from its traditional allies to Russia</a>. But he then rushed to Washington for a hurriedly organized meeting with Mr. Trump to fortify the president in negotiations over the fate of Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>His visit is part of a blitz of European trips to Washington these days to influence the new administration. President Andrzej Duda of Poland attended the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington over the weekend to meet with Mr. Trump, who kept him waiting for more than an hour. And Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain plans to visit the White House on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/europe/world-war-i-trump-macron.html" title="">a long and complicated history</a>. As the president greeted Mr. Macron at the entrance to the West Wing on Monday, the two engaged in a vigorous handshake in which both seemed in a lighthearted but pointed way trying to assert masculine dominance, reminiscent of similar encounters during Mr. Trump’s first term. During their later session in the Oval Office, they flashed smiles, flattered each other and jocularly shook hands again. At the end of their subsequent news conference, Mr. Macron made a point of hugging Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Macron, who last week warned that “you can’t be weak in front of President Putin,” said that he had cut off his own contacts with the Russian president after the massacre of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha in 2022. But he quickly added that he approved of Mr. Trump’s new effort because his election presented “a new context.”</p><p>At the same time, he emphasized that any agreement with Russia must be “checked and verified” and repeatedly made reference to two cease-fires, called the Minsk accords, that were signed and then broken after Russia’s original invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Mr. Trump, in response, said that it was in the interest of Russia to “make a deal” but did not mention what Moscow must give up or what security guarantees must be negotiated.</p><p>“I really believe that he wants to make a deal,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Putin. “May be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He added that he had spoken with Mr. Putin about the possibility of deploying European peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor any cease-fire and that the Russian president would go along with it.</p><p>Mr. Macron, one of the prime sponsors of the idea of a European peacekeeping force, said he agreed with Mr. Trump that Europe must take on more responsibility. As for the United States, he added that the “Americans will be there in solidarity.”</p><p>Whether Mr. Putin really would accept foreign troops on Ukrainian territory could be an important factor in any negotiations. In an interview released on Monday, Mr. Putin stressed the economic benefits of a rapprochement with the United States, playing to Mr. Trump’s interest in the financial side of international diplomacy.</p><p>As for Mr. Trump, the Russian leader praised him, calling him someone who “does not simply say what he thinks, but he says what he wants.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
