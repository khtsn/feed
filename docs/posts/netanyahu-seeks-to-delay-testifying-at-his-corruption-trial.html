He denies the accusations, which center on claims that he used his influence to help leading businessmen in exchange for gifts and favorable media coverage.</p><p>On Sunday night, Mr. Netanyahu’s legal team filed a request with the court to delay his appearance by two and a half months, according to Amit Hadad, one of the prime minister’s lawyers. The prime minister has been too consumed by running the country during wartime and needs more time to prepare his defense, Mr. Hadad said in a brief phone interview.</p><p>Critics countered that Mr. Netanyahu had an ulterior motive. The prime minister’s “only interest” is<span>  </span>“not to go to jail,” Yair Golan, an opposition leader, said in a radio interview. “Besides that, there is no other real consideration.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The request came as Mr. Netanyahu battled to rebut <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-leaked-documents-hamas-gaza.html" title="">separate allegations involving officials in his office</a>.</p><p>Investigators are examining whether Mr. Netanyahu’s aides leaked sensitive intelligence materials to the news media and doctored the official records of phone conversations at the start of the war involving the prime minister, according to officials briefed on the cases who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss a sensitive matter. The prime minister has denied the accusations, calling them “fake news” intended to undermine his authority at a sensitive moment in Israel’s wars on several fronts.</p><p>The two developments have sharpened a yearslong dispute within Israeli society about Mr. Netanyahu’s integrity, one that helped lead to five elections in less than four years and played a role in years of street protest.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu and his supporters have long argued that the trial is a confected effort to force an elected leader from power on spurious legal grounds instead of at the ballot box.</p><p>His critics, including former allies who broke with him over the issue, say that the trial is a legitimate attempt to hold Mr. Netanyahu to account for wrongdoing, and that his decision to remain in power while standing trial means that he has prioritized his personal goals over the national interest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The recent allegations about Mr. Netanyahu’s aides have given fresh momentum to that criticism.</p><p>One aide, who is under arrest, stands accused of helping to leak classified documents to a foreign news outlet, according to six defense officials familiar with the case. The aide is thought to have done so to help build public opposition to a cease-fire in Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu had an interest in stoking that opposition: The prime minister’s coalition could have collapsed if a truce was reached before Hamas was completely defeated, because several far-right lawmakers within the coalition had threatened to quit.</p><p>Separately, police officers are investigating a complaint that officials in the prime minister’s office tampered with the records of phone calls made by the prime minister on the first day of the war, according to six defense officials briefed on the case. Records detailing what and when the prime minister knew about Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, could prove important in any inquiry into the failure by Israeli political and military leaders — including the prime minister — to prevent the attack and later stem its consequences.</p><p>A former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said his insistence on an independent investigation into such security failures was one of the reasons Mr. Netanyahu fired him from his cabinet post last week. The prime minister has said that an inquiry must wait until the war is over.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office declined to comment for this article but he has publicly denied the claims and presented himself as the victim of double standards.</p><p>In a strongly worded statement issued over the weekend, Mr. Netanyahu questioned why the security services do not appear to have investigated what he described as a “tsunami of leaks” made by others throughout the war, including about cabinet meetings, negotiations with Hamas, and political disagreements within the government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Hezbollah and Iran receive, at times on live television, transcripts of discussions among us about the plans of action against them and our internal debates,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “On all those, zero investigations have been conducted. Zero.”</p><p>He added: “We know exactly what’s going on here. This is an organized manhunt meant to undermine the state’s leadership and weaken us at the height of the war.”</p><p>Myra Noveck<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Ronen Bergman is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, based in Tel Aviv.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ronen-bergman">More about Ronen Bergman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israeli Attacks:</strong><strong> </strong>Israel’s military struck a house in northern Gaza where displaced families were sheltering, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/gaza-jabaliya-israel.html">killing at least 34 people</a>.
