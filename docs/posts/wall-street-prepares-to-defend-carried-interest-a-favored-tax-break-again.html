But are American tech giants making the right call here?</em></p><h2 id="link-5e368450">A new fight over carried interest</h2><p>President Trump has outlined his tax priorities to Republican lawmakers. Among them was a surprise: the so-called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/trump-will-seek-to-end-carried-interest-expand-salt-in-tax-bill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">carried interest “loophole.”</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That could mean Wall Street will have to brace for a big fight to keep one of its most cherished tax breaks.</p><p><strong>Carried interest was one of several items Trump mentioned yesterday,</strong> according to Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. He reiterated ideas he promoted on the campaign trail, including ending taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payouts, as well as expanding deductions for state and local taxes.</p><p>But his call to end the carried interest exemption — and tax breaks for “billionaire sports-team owners” (many of whom <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/nfl-mlb-nba-owners-2024-election-trump-harris/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported Trump</a>) — wasn’t on many observers’ bingo cards.</p><p><strong>A reminder:</strong> Carried interest is the cut that hedge fund, private equity and venture capital investors take from their funds’ profits, which is taxed as capital gains and therefore at a far lower rate than regular income.</p><p><strong>Carried interest has long been criticized as a giveaway to wealthy financiers.</strong> Opponents of the exemption include Republican and Democratic lawmakers and prominent business leaders including Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon. Getting rid of it, they say, could raise billions for the government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That could be important for Trump, who’s seeking to extend other tax cuts he enacted in 2017 and would benefit from ways to offset that lost income. (“<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113962698098343227" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BALANCED BUDGET</a>!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social just now.)</p><p>Presidents have tried to kill it before, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/business/10sorkin.html" title="">Barack Obama</a>, <a href="https://www.eatonvance.com/advisory-blog.php?post=what-bidens-tax-proposal-means-for-the-wealthiest-taxpayers-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> — and yes, Trump, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/08/donald-trumps-economic-speech-annotated/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once called the tax break</a> “good for Wall Street investors and for people like me but unfair to American workers.”</p><p><strong>But the carried interest break has survived again and again, </strong>thanks to powerful defenders in Washington. Members of both parties in Congress, including the then-Democratic Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/business/dealbook/sinema-tax-loophole-carried-interest.html" title="">Kyrsten Sinema</a> in 2021, have opposed efforts to kill the carried interest exemption.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/business/trump-carried-interest-lobbyists.html" title="">Heavy lobbying by industry groups</a> undoubtedly helped keep it alive as well. Financiers’ allies are already <a href="https://nvca.org/press_releases/nvca-statement-on-trumps-carried-interest-comments/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">readying their defenses</a>.</p><p><strong>Could this time be different?</strong> Congressional Republicans appear more loyal to the Trump agenda and more driven by populism. “The battle over carried interest is likely <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3487e2b5-d18e-4f49-b45f-44eede3dd4c9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">going to be the toughest yet</a>,” an unidentified strategist told The Financial Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Then again, Republican lawmakers — who hold only slim majorities in both chambers — are already having trouble <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5132110-speaker-johnson-house-lawmakers-to-work-through-weekend-amid-trump-agenda-stalemate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreeing on a budget</a>.

(They actually described government subscriptions to the Politico Pro service.) The Agriculture Department said it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/media/politico-news-subscriptions-white-house.html" title="">canceled its subscription to Politico Pro</a>.</p></li><li><p>Musk’s cost-cutting group is set to focus on potential cuts at the <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/02/06/2025/inside-doges-march-with-the-social-security-administration-soon-to-come" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Social Security Administration</a>, according to Semafor.

Elez resigned from DOGE yesterday after The Wall Street Journal asked about his links to a social media account that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">advocated racism and eugenics</a>.</p></li><li><p>New opinion polling shows that Musk and his cost-cutting efforts have become <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/06/democrats-elon-musk-donald-trump-00202833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unpopular with the public</a>: A survey by The Economist and YouGov this week, for example, found that <a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econtoplines_c1AfT3R.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">49 percent of respondents</a> had unfavorable views of him, compared with 43 percent who had favorable opinions.</p></li></ul><hr/><h2 id="link-7b01eb77">The Trump E.T.F. goes “patriotic” </h2><p>President Trump’s war against environmental and social investing (along with diversity, equity and inclusion) has hit a new front.</p><p>His social media company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/business/trump-media-financial-services.html" title="">plans to sell financial products</a>, including a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, aimed at what he calls the “patriotic economy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>What’s happening:</strong> Trump Media and Technology Group (which trades under the ticker DJT and jumped 6 percent on the news) filed trademark applications for a bunch of E.T.F.s.</p><p>They’re meant to give investors a chance to put money into “American energy, manufacturing and other firms that provide a competitive alternative to the woke funds and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/crypto-debanking-trump.html" title="">debanking problems</a> that you find throughout the market,” Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s C.E.O., said in a statement.</p><p><strong>Look for these funds to include businesses that line up with Trump’s agenda.</strong> It’s not hard to imagine the right-wing video platform Rumble, crypto companies or gun makers being listed in one of these funds. Consider also American energy companies hoping to drill on federal land or businesses that only manufacture in the U.S.</p><p>It’s Trump’s way of creating an investment philosophy that directly opposes the E.S.G. movement that took hold under former President Joe Biden. Backlash against such efforts prompted lawsuits against companies like BlackRock, and now E.S.G. investing has fallen out of favor.</p><p><strong>The E.T.F.s would allow Trump to anoint companies and executives with his approval. </strong>In Trump’s first term, world and business leaders often booked rooms at the Trump International Hotel in Washington to curry favor.

Some financial products described in the trademark applications may need approval from the S.E.C., but given the Trump administration’s blitz of activity across Washington, they are likely to win the necessary approvals.</p><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Selling financial products regulated by agencies under Trump’s control opens up a wide range of potential conflicts of interest.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-4ddcadf0">What a CBS transcript says about a big media deal </h2><p>After President Trump sued CBS for what he claimed was a deceptively edited “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during the campaign, the broadcaster — under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission — released a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/05/business/media/60-minutes-kamala-harris-interview-transcript.html" title="">full transcript</a> of the interview.</p><p>It’s common practice for news organizations to shorten interviews in news articles or TV broadcasts for the sake of concision. And CBS said the transcript shows that the “60 Minutes” broadcast “was not doctored or deceitful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But Trump asserted yesterday that the show and the network “defrauded” the public, arguing that “CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at ’60 Minutes’ should all be thrown out.”</p><p>What does this mean for the proposed multibillion-dollar merger by CBS’s parent company, Paramount, and Skydance? The setup of the F.C.C. review could give us a clue.</p><p><strong>A recap:</strong> Trump’s charge of media bias at CBS could come up in the agency’s review of the Paramount-Skydance deal. Brendan Carr, the new F.C.C. chairman, requested a full transcript of the interview.</p><p><strong>But that may not necessarily slow the deal review. </strong>While Carr requested public comment on the “60 Minutes” interview, he created a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-107A1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>new</em></a><a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-107A1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> docket</a> for it, rather than using <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/transaction/skydance-paramount" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the one</a> he had opened for the review of the Skydance deal.</p><p>In theory, that means he could rule on the Skydance acquisition before the public comment period on the CBS transcript concludes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>What’s next? </strong>Trump has until today to amend his complaint against CBS — and if his latest statement is any indication, he has not grown tired of the fight.</p><p>For Skydance, knowing the outcome of that case may be as important as getting Carr’s go-ahead.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="link-7c091e00"><span>THE SPEED READ </span></h3><p><strong>Deals</strong></p><ul><li><p>President Trump is said to have tasked Vice President JD Vance and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, with <a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/2725-am/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overseeing the potential government-brokered sale of TikTok</a>.
