The missile landed in waters between North Korea and Japan.</p><p>The military said it was analyzing data to learn more about the missile, but that it believed it was an ICBM. North Korea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/17/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-icbm.html" title="">last tested a long-range missile</a>​ in December, when it test-fired its solid-fueled Hwasong-18 ICBM.</p><p>North Korea confirmed later Thursday that its military had launched an ICBM, saying that its leader, Kim Jong-un, had been present. North Korea “will never change its line of bolstering up its nuclear forces,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The launch on Thursday was the North’s first major weapons test since September, when it fired a new type of Hwasong-11 short-range ballistic missile, which it said could carry a “super-large” conventional warhead weighing 4.5 tons.</p><p>On Wednesday, South Korean defense intelligence officials told lawmakers that North Korea might conduct long-range missile tests before the American presidential election next week. They also said that the North was preparing to conduct its seventh underground nuclear test, in a bid to raise tensions and gain diplomatic leverage with the next U.S. president. North Korea conducted its last nuclear test in 2017.</p><p>In recent weeks, North Korea has posed a fresh security challenge to Washington and its allies by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-north-korean-troops.html" title="">sending</a> an estimated 11,000 troops to Russia to fight in its war against Ukraine. Thousands of them, outfitted with Russian uniforms and equipment, have moved closer to the front lines, preparing themselves for possible battle against Ukrainian troops, South Korean and American officials said.</p><p>The U.S. secretary of defense, Lloyd J. Austin III, and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun of South Korea met in Washington on Wednesday for annual defense talks between the allies. They <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3951794/56th-security-consultative-meeting-joint-communique/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> they “condemned in the strongest terms with one voice” the cooperation between Russia and North Korea that “has expanded beyond transfers of military supplies to actual deployment of forces.”</p><p>Mr. Austin <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3951961/us-south-korea-concerned-north-koreans-may-soon-fight-against-ukrainians/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he was increasingly concerned that President Vladimir V. Putin planned to use the North Korean soldiers to support Russia’s combat operations in its Kursk region, where Ukraine has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/world/europe/russia-kursk-ukraine-invasion-civilians.html" title="">held territory</a> since invading in August.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Putin has gone tin-cupping to get weapons” from North Korea and Iran, Mr. Austin said. “Turning to a pariah state like North Korea for troops just underscores how much trouble he is in.”</p><p>Besides the troops, North Korea has sent 16,000 shipping containers full of artillery shells, rockets and missiles to Russia since the summer of last year, according to Washington and Seoul. When Mr. Putin met with Mr. Kim, the North’s leader, in Pyongyang in June, they restored a Cold War-era treaty of mutual defense and military cooperation between their countries.</p><p>That agreement raised fears in Washington and Seoul that Mr. Kim was forming an alliance with Russia to counter the one between South Korea and the United States, which also features a mutual defense treaty. In return for providing weapons and troops to Russia, North Korea was also seeking to get advanced technologies from Moscow to improve its missiles and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/27/world/asia/north-korea-satellite-spy.html" title="">satellite-launch</a> programs, U.S. and South Korean analysts said.</p><p>Days after Mr. Putin’s visit to Pyongyang, North Korea said for the first time that it had tested technology for launching <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test.html" title="">several nuclear warheads with a single missile.</a></p><p>South Korean defense officials said that the launch appeared to indicate some improvement in North Korea’s ICBM capabilities. The missile fired may have been a new solid-fuel ICBM, said Lee Sung-joon, a spokesman for the South Korean military. When North Korea’s leader visited a munitions factory in September, state media released photos showing what looked like a new and bigger ICBM.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Thursday’s ICBM flew for a longer time than any previous one North Korea has launched — approximately 86 minutes, according to Japan’s Defense Ministry.</p><p>North Korea has launched several ICBMs in recent years, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch.html" title="">ones with solid propellant</a> that are easier to move and hide, and faster to launch, than its old liquid-fuel versions. But all of those missiles were fired at steep angles, rather than being sent across the Pacific.</p><p>North Korea has never demonstrated an ability to fire an ICBM on a normal, flatter trajectory. Another technological hurdle the North has yet to show it has cleared is so-called re-entry technology. After soaring into space, an ICBM warhead must endure intense heat and friction as it crashes back into the earth’s atmosphere and toward its target.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/choe-sang-hun">More about Choe Sang-Hun</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/kim-jongun">Kim Jong-un </a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/lloyd-austin">Lloyd Austin</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Afghanistan’s Best Hope for Change?: </strong>Sirajuddin Haqqani has tried to remake himself from blood-soaked jihadist to pragmatic Taliban statesman. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/asia/afghanistan-sirajuddin-haqqani-taliban.html">Western diplomats are shocked — and enticed</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Life in a Russian Prison: </strong>Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, spent five years in a Russian prison before his release in a historic prisoner swap. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/europe/paul-whelan-russia-prisoner-swap.html">He described the moment of his arrest and the long wait for freedom</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Echoes of China’s Housing Crash: </strong>A pop-up city in Malaysia was an audacious $100 billion project by a top Chinese developer.
