Then, when they came within 650 feet of the building where President Yoon Suk Yeol was believed to be holed up, they came face to face with an even more formidable barrier: 10 buses and cars along with 200 elite soldiers and bodyguards belonging to Mr. Yoon’s Presidential Security Service.

The nation appears rudderless and distracted by infighting at a time when it faces major challenges at home and on the international scene.</p><p>There is already uncertainty around its alliance with the United States as the unpredictable Donald J. Trump prepares to return to the White House. Seoul’s decades-old foe North Korea has sought to score propaganda points from the South’s political quagmire, with its state media reporting that its neighbor was in “paralysis of its state administration and spiraling sociopolitical confusion.”</p><p>And, at home, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/asia/south-korea-plane-crash-jeju.html" title="">the crash of a Jeju Air passenger jet</a> that killed 179 of the 181 people on board on Sunday has added to as list of challenges that range from widespread labor strikes to rising household debts. On Thursday, the finance ministry sharply downgraded its growth forecast for 2025.</p><p>A Constitutional Court is deliberating whether to remove Mr. Yoon, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/14/world/south-korea-impeachment-president-yoon" title="">impeached on Dec. 14</a> by the National Assembly. That came after he abruptly declared martial law 11 days earlier, prompting national outrage and calls for his ouster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On Friday, the besieged Mr. Yoon vowed to fight to return to office through the Constitutional Court trial and showed he had no intention of voluntarily subjecting himself to criminal investigations.

In 1995, prosecutors wanted to question the former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan on insurrection and mutiny charges stemming from his role in a 1979 coup and a massacre of demonstrators the following year. He defied the summons and headed to his southern hometown, trailed by a crowd of supporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The prosecutors chased him there. After an overnight standoff, Mr. Chun surrendered himself.</p><p>But unlike Mr. Yoon, Mr. Chun was out of office when he faced the insurrection charge. Mr. Yoon, though suspended, is still guarded with the full support of his Presidential Security Service, a government agency that hires teams of elite bodyguards and anti-terrorist experts selected from the police, military and other government services.</p><p>“People who have seen him rely on his bodyguards as a shield against his legal trouble will see him as a coward,” Mr. Lim said.</p><p>The investigators warned that they would charge the presidential bodyguards with obstruction of justice.</p><p>“We will do everything we can to provide security for the object of our service according to laws and principles,” the Presidential Security Service said in a statement.</p><p>Public surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans wanted Mr. Yoon ousted and punished for insurrection.
