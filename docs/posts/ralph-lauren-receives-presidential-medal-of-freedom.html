Kennedy, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor. It has been bestowed upon a host of cultural, corporate and political figures, including Babe Ruth, Mother Teresa, Julia Child, Warren Buffett, John McCain and Rush Limbaugh.</p><p>If ever there was a fashion designer worthy of this award, it is Mr. Lauren. A son of the Bronx, Mr. Lauren marketed a preppy image to the upwardly mobile masses, building his eponymous company into a multimillion dollar corporation — one he remains executive chairman and chief creative officer of nearly a half-century after he founded it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The fashion world, which had been largely absent from the event in the past, was well represented at the White House on Saturday. Joining Mr. Lauren in receiving the gilded medallion from President Biden was Anna Wintour, a steely Brit (and longtime supporter of Democratic causes) who has been Vogue’s editor in chief since 1988.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The fashion world was also represented at Saturday’s event by Anna Wintour, the longtime editor in chief of Vogue, who was one of the 18 people honored by President Biden.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Valerie Plesch for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In her introduction, Ms. Wintour, who was dressed in a shin-length plaid coat and forwent her ever-present oversized sunglasses for the occasion, was hailed for using “fashion as a mirror to reflect our culture.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/us/politics/biden-medals-freedom.html" title="">Other recipients</a> on Saturday included Hillary Clinton, Bono, José Andrés, Lionel Messi and George Soros.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Lauren, was joined at the ceremony by his wife of 60 years, Ricky Lauren, dressed in a sleek black suit, and his elder brother Jerry Lauren. Also in attendance were Mr. Lauren’s three children: Andrew, David and Dylan.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Born in New York to immigrant parents in 1939, Mr. Lauren nosed into the apparel market in the late 1960s by introducing a line of men’s neckties, which he sold out of a drawer in a showroom in the Empire State Building. Soon, Mr. Lauren was marketing a holistic shoes-to-suits brand of aspirational prepwear.</p><p>The rest is well-trod fashion history, as Mr. Lauren rode his brand’s pony logo to the celestial heights of American fashion. In a sense, he found success by perfecting the building blocks of the all-American look: bluejeans, polo shirts, white T-shirts, flannels and work boots. As Mr. Lauren <a href="https://robbreport.com/style/menswear/ralph-lauren-designer-american-dream-1235202652/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the luxury magazine Robb Report</a> in 2023, “I loved things that were American.” His brand’s brisk-selling American flag sweaters put an exclamation point on that.</p><p>Mr. Lauren expanded the brand into winsome home goods and personally came to embody the aspirational image pushed through his label’s cinematic ad campaigns. Mr. Lauren’s holdings include a garage full of automobiles and a sprawling ranch in the Colorado mountains. Rife with leather furniture, saddle blankets and polished wood accents, Mr. Lauren’s oft-photographed homes are lived-in tableaus of his well-honed all-American look.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Lauren has displayed his patriotism through work with the United States Olympic team.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Valerie Plesch for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Through his brand, the designer has been a patriotic cheerleader, and if not a friend, at least an acquaintance, to many political figures. For decades, his company has outfitted the United States Olympic team, dressing athletes in all forms of spangled and striped sportswear. In 2022, during a period of national soul-searching about racial inequity, Ralph Lauren <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/style/ralph-lauren-hbcu-morehouse-spelman.html" title="">collaborated with</a> Morehouse College and Spelman College, two historically Black colleges in Atlanta on a collection including silk wrap dresses and a schoolboy blazer — dressy pieces defying the look of today’s sweatpants-loving undergrads.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>There is bipartisan appeal to Mr. Lauren’s clothes. Nancy Reagan and Michelle Obama both wore the brand’s designs during their time in the White House. In 2017, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/fashion/melania-trump-wearing-ralph-lauren-channels-a-predecessor-jacqueline-kennedy.html" title="">Melania Trump wore</a> a cashmere dress from the brand at her husband’s swearing in. Mr. Lauren’s son, David, married George H.W. Bush’s granddaughter Lauren, in 2011.</p><p>Mr. Lauren’s company seems to hold a special significance for the Bidens. Mr. Biden wore a Ralph Lauren overcoat and suit at his inauguration in 2021 while Jill Biden, who has often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/style/jill-biden-vogue-cover.html" title="">been photographed</a> in the brand’s designs (including on the cover of Ms. Wintour’s Vogue last year), was the marquee guest at Ralph Lauren’s most recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/style/ralph-lauren-jill-biden-hamptons-fashion-show.html" title="">runway show</a>, held in the Hamptons in September.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>2025 Trends: </strong>What will we wear, eat, buy, believe and desire in the new year? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/style/trends-predictions-2025.html">Here are 12 predictions</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Evolution of At-Home Beauty: </strong>As the science of skin care continues to expand, some of those advances have landed directly in consumers’ hands. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/style/home-beauty-device-trends.html">Is that a good thing?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Seeking a ‘Music Massage’: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/style/vinyl-listening-bars.html">Vinyl-focused listening bars</a> inspired by ones in Japan are opening across New York, attracting audiophiles and city dwellers looking for a respite from the cacophony outside their doors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obscure Bumper Stickers: </strong>Gone are the days of “Coexist” or “This car climbed Mt.
