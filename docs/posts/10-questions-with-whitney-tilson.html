    <h1>10 Questions With Whitney Tilson</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund executive, entered the New York City mayor’s race last year, hoping to follow in the footsteps of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a business leader who is not part of the political establishment.</p><p>He has portrayed himself as a moderate alternative to the left-leaning candidates and has qualified for more than $2 million in public matching funds. But in a crowded field, he has <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/nyc-2025-poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggled to rise above 1 percent</a> in the polls.</p><p>Ahead of the June 24 primary, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/nyregion/nyc-mayor-candidates-2025.html" title="">leading Democrats in the race</a> visited The New York Times for interviews. We are publishing excerpts from those interviews, and this is the third in the series; our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>We asked Mr. Tilson, 58, questions about 10 themes, with the occasional follow-up, touching on his love for cycling and his <a href="https://x.com/WhitneyTilson/status/1929894281591832743" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">escalating criticism of Zohran Mamdani</a>, a progressive state lawmaker.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>We’ve written previously about where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/21/nyregion/nyc-mayor-democratic-candidates-issues.html" title="">Mr. Tilson and the other candidates stand on key issues</a> and which candidates are raising the most money <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/06/nyregion/nyc-mayor-funding-neighborhood-donations.html" title="">in your neighborhood</a>.</p><h3 id="link-2d28f92"><span>1. What’s the most important issue in the race: affordability, public safety, President Trump or something else?</span></h3><p>I’m trying to elevate the issue of fixing our schools. It’s the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/about-us/funding/funding-our-schools" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">single biggest part of our budget</a>, and I think it’s the root of so many of the other problems we see in our city, from the school-to-prison pipeline to affordability.</p><h3 id="link-19a31fab"><span>What are two concrete actions you would take in your first year to improve schools?</span></h3><p>No. 1, I would champion charter schools. The mayor and the schools chancellor have a great deal of <a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/co-location-handbook.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">control over co-location</a>. <em>[He is referring to the practice of charter schools sharing a building with another school.]</em></p><p>Secondly, I would eliminate <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2023/6/12/23758532/grade-retention-social-promotion-studies-reading-research-mississippi/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social promotion after third grade</a> to force the system to teach kids to read properly.</p><h3 id="link-3938a499"><span>2. Who was the best New York City mayor in your lifetime?</span></h3><p>Bloomberg, you won’t be surprised to hear me say. He was an outsider and business person and was independent of all of the special interest groups in New York, and I felt like he was really fighting for New Yorkers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h3 id="link-3446848"><span>3. Eric Adams recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/curbside-composting-brooklyn.html" title="">delayed the start of some fines for composting</a>. Should composting be mandatory?</span></h3><p>I would delay it. I consider myself an environmentalist, but it’s just sort of one more cost to the city that I worry that we can’t afford right now.</p><h3 id="link-3d5635a1"><span>A cost for New Yorkers or the cost of enforcement?</span></h3><p>Both. Right now, I worry that we’ve made New York City unlivable for too many people with all sorts of well-intentioned mandates and so I would delay this.</p><h3 id="link-234d8b4e"><span>4. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/nyregion/bqe-trucks-sensors-traffic.html" title="">Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is crumbling</a>. How would you fix it?</span></h3><p>I’m not sure I have sat in that traffic recently. So I don’t have any specific thoughts on that particular expressway.</p><h3 id="link-6dba3ad9"><span>5. What’s one issue in politics that you’ve changed your mind on?</span></h3><p>President Biden not running for a second term was something that I was initially quiet about, and I didn’t fully appreciate how much he had deteriorated, physically and mentally. I was sort of fooled by the coverup, I suppose. It wasn’t until after the debate that I realized how bad things were and that he was going to lose in a landslide, and so I very quickly pivoted and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGB64nW8CJU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">got very loud</a> and was one of the most vocal Democratic donors in the country, in terms of going on national television <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/biden-debate-performance.html" title="">calling for him to step aside</a>. I got my wish there.</p><p>The second thing I called for was an open primary and a real horse race into the Democratic convention. I knew that time was short, but I worried that in nominating someone who was the vice president of a deeply unpopular president, that we were simply going to switch from one losing horse to another. I lost that battle, and my worst fears were realized.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-72f53afc"><span>6. There have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/nyregion/eric-adams-residence.html" title="">questions about where Mayor Eric Adams lives</a>. Where do you live?</span></h3><p>98th and Fifth. Upper East Side.</p><h3 id="link-5650668a"><span>How much is your rent or mortgage?</span></h3><p>I was lucky enough — we purchased it in 2002 so I’ve lived there 23 years, and so we pay $5,000 a month in maintenance, everything all in.</p><h3 id="link-756a4ef7"><span>Do you own a car?</span></h3><p>Yes, one car.</p><h3 id="link-adcd16e"><span>What model?</span></h3><p>A Volvo XC60 2018.</p><h3 id="link-2f256f66"><span>How often do you take the subway or bus?</span></h3><p>Every day almost. My primary method of transportation is my bike, and I bike rain, snow or shine, anywhere that I can bike to.</p><h3 id="link-5329838"><span>7. How would you describe your personal financial situation? Are you in the 1 percent?</span></h3><p>I would say 1 percent. I’m comfortable. I’m fortunate. But I could not have self-funded this campaign to any degree, or written even a few million dollars in checks, much less $73 million, which I believe is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/nyregion/cost-of-being-mayor-650-million-if-hes-rich.html" title="">what Mike Bloomberg spent</a>. I probably would not have entered this race were there not the public matching program.</p><h3 id="link-3a59c22e"><span>8. Why have you criticized Zohran Mamdani so strongly?</span></h3><p>I think Zohran Mamdani is very dangerous, and he has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/nyregion/mamdani-deport-paladino.html" title="">using the word genocide</a>, for example, to refer to Israel’s actions. I think that kind of inflammatory rhetoric is very dangerous. I have been very vocal in my criticism, particularly of him, not for expressing sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians, which I share, but for using rhetoric and being out there even in the days after Oct. 7, before Israel had even responded, he was <a href="https://qns.com/2023/10/mamdani-arrested-protest-brooklyn/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">out there leading protests</a>.</p><h3 id="link-60576769"><span>9. What is your bagel order or favorite breakfast sandwich?</span></h3><p>I sort of have a sweet tooth, so a cinnamon raisin bagel with plain cream cheese, or maybe honey walnut cream cheese sometimes.</p><h3 id="link-29a6a811"><span>What shop?</span></h3><p>A little new bagel shop that opened up: <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d23830468-Reviews-Grabstein_s_Bagels-New_York_City_New_York.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grabstein’s</a>.</p><h3 id="link-7dfe2977"><span>10. What’s the last TV show you binged?</span></h3><p>I am a die-hard “Survivor” fan. I have never missed an episode in 25 years, and it’s always been my dream to be on “Survivor.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma G.
