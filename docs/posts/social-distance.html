    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Where were you in March of 2020? When did you realize Covid was a thing that was going to disrupt life as you knew it? I was hiking in Joshua Tree, spending my days delirious at the natural beauty of the desert, unsure if I should return to New York. Each time I refreshed The Times’s coverage, it seemed more and more evident that going home would mean staying indoors for the foreseeable future.</p><p>I came back. I began working at The Times a few months later (from my living room) and soon started writing a newsletter called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/at-home-newsletter" title="">At Home</a>, wherein I tried to help people lead full, cultured lives from their living rooms. It was a project intended to help people find distraction, comfort, meaning, joy, sense, commiseration and community in the midst of what felt at times like intolerable uncertainty. Here’s what to watch, read, cook, listen to, think about. You could attend this virtual disco, or this virtual poetry reading or someone’s virtual birthday party, where you’ll squint at screen after screen of squares of people you know and people you don’t, smiling and focused, so close up and so far away. Remember virtual happy hours? Remember Zoom shirts? Remember when it was weird to see your colleagues’ bedroom décor on video calls? Who would have thought Brian from analytics would choose <em>those</em> table lamps?</p><p>I spent so much time thinking about coping in those days. We all did. In the midst of a lot of confusion and sadness, there was creativity. Pandemic pods. Sourdough mania. Alfresco dining enabled by every conceivable form of outdoor heating element. A friend of mine started a dance troupe in her town that practiced its choreography on Zoom then performed their dances on neighbors’ lawns. Another built a bed in the back of her SUV and drove across the country, sleeping in her car. I reconnected with college pals I hadn’t spoken to in decades; once we realized how easy it was to FaceTime, it seemed ridiculous that we hadn’t been doing it all along.</p><p>Five years isn’t long enough to get perspective, not really. It’s a roundish number so it feels meaningful: a good time for retrospectives, to ask what we learned, how we’ve changed, how we haven’t. The things we swore we’d do differently once “the world opened up again” — are we doing them? I vowed more socializing, more dinner parties, more dancing, more trips, more visiting people just because. No more taking in-person contact with other humans for granted! I’d like to renew these vows, but the world opened up and so did the options. There was so much room for longing in lockdown, so much time to romanticize freedom of movement and to fantasize about the possible lives we’d lead in the future. But unless you put some kind of plan in place for executing these intentions, it was easy enough to just slide back into how it once was: Other humans are lovely at times and annoying a lot of the time and it takes effort to plan a dinner party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But remember when every hug involved calculation? I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/at-home/newsletter.html" title="">wrote about it</a> in the At Home newsletter, how I hoped “this new appreciation for each fleeting moment of contact, the meaning in every casual touch” wouldn’t ever go away. Despite my best intentions, it has. However sincere our lockdown-era intentions to forever relish all the things we missed, we reverted. There’s probably not a lot from that period we want to resurrect, but maybe those plans, those intentions to value each other a little more intentionally, we could consider revisiting.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><p>Government Funding</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Chuck Schumer, center, in the Capitol on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ben Curtis/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><ul><li><p>The Senate passed a spending bill to keep the government running, after Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and several other Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/14/us/trump-government-shutdown-news/senate-vote-shutdown?smid=url-share" title="">allowed the measure to advance</a>.</p></li><li><p>Schumer, who made an about-face on the bill in recent days, said he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/schumer-trump-government-shutdown.html" title="">protecting Democrats</a> from the long-term damage of shutdown.</p></li><li><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/nyregion/aoc-schumer-democrats-ny.html" title="">many in his party disagreed</a>. “I believe that’s a tremendous mistake,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said.</p></li></ul><p>More on Politics</p><ul><li><p>In a speech to the Department of Justice, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-speech-justice-department.html" title="">lashed out at the lawyers and prosecutors</a> who had investigated him or opposed his policies.

It’s easy to understand why: Her virtuosic works allowed us to peer into her mind, but only just. Since her death in late 2021, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/books/review/cory-leadbeater-joan-didion-uptown-local.html" title="">several books</a> have sought to parse her legacy. Next month, Knopf will publish <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/books/new-book-joan-didion-notes-to-john.html" title="">200 pages of her journal entries</a>.</p><p>Here’s another Didion biography for the bookshelf. In this book — subtitled “Joan Didion and the American Dream Machine” — the Times critic Alissa Wilkinson explores Didion’s relationship to film. It is not a hagiography, however: “Its strongest sections,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/books/review/we-tell-ourselves-stories-alissa-wilkinson.html" title="">our reviewer writes</a>, “are the ones that question rather than venerate her.”</p><h3 id="link-63067b6e"><span><strong>RECIPE OF THE WEEK</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Simpson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-1494bbaf">Pasta With Spicy Sausage, Broccoli Rabe and Chickpeas</h2><p>If you’re craving the comfort of a big bowl of pasta, Lidey Heuck’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020968-pasta-with-spicy-sausage-broccoli-rabe-and-chickpeas?algo=identity&amp;fellback=true&amp;imp_id=8858440764022135&amp;req_id=63272395216105&amp;surface=cooking-search-web&amp;variant=0_relevance_reranking" title="">pasta with spicy sausage, broccoli rabe and chickpeas</a> makes an easy and hearty late winter meal. Lidey’s clever move is to add earthy, nutty chickpeas to the traditional Italian combination of sausage and broccoli rabe. Then she takes it all one step further, stirring Parmesan, butter, and lemon into the pan to balance the flavors and add body to the sauce. Her recipe is flexible, too. Substitute broccoli or other study greens in for the broccoli rabe, and feel free to use any kind of sausage or shape of pasta you’ve got on hand. Maybe make it once according to the recipe, then let yourself play. Dishes like these are the most fun to adapt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chris Ramos in the Bay Area.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marissa Leshnov for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>The Hunt: </strong>A California native spent years living in room rentals and a van to save for a home of his own.
