The United States said it would immediately resume providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid.html" title="">which the Trump administration had suspended</a> after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/zelensky-showdown-trump.html" title="">an explosive U.S.-Ukraine meeting</a> at the White House.</p><p>The United States and Ukraine also agreed to conclude “as soon as possible” a deal to develop Ukraine’s critical mineral resources.</p><h2 id="link-217770aa">Russia’s stance</h2><p>Mr. Putin has not yet agreed to halt the war that Russia began more than three years ago. He has said the idea for a cease-fire was “the right one and we definitely support it,” but laid out numerous conditions that could delay or derail any truce. That includes demands that Ukraine cease mobilizing new soldiers, training troops or importing weapons for the duration of any pause in fighting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Putin also said that Russia would continue to insist on a peace deal that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/us-ukraine-talks-rubio-saudi-arabia.html" title="">addressed the “original causes” of the wa</a>r — signaling that he will not stop fighting until he extracts a pledge that Ukraine will not join NATO and that the alliance will reduce its presence in Central and Eastern Europe.</p><p>“There are questions that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to talk them through with our American colleagues and partners,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/putin-ceasefire-ukraine-trump.html" title="">told a news conference on Thursday</a>, just before meeting with Steve Witkoff, who is Mr. Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East but has also been playing a role in the peace talks over Ukraine.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Witkoff told CNN that his meeting with Mr. Putin had lasted three to four hours. While he declined to share the specifics of their conversation, he said it went well and that the two sides had “narrowed the differences between them.”</p><p>The cease-fire proposal could create tension between Mr. Putin’s desires for a far-reaching victory in Ukraine and for close ties with Mr. Trump.</p><h2 id="link-690e6a96">Conversation topics</h2><p>The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to say what topics were on the agenda for the call.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump said on Sunday night that he expected to discuss territorial issues with Mr. Putin as well as the fate of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/europe/putin-trump-russia-ukraine.html" title="">Ukrainian power plants</a>. He also noted that there had already been discussions about “dividing up certain assets.”</p><p>“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe we can. Maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance.”</p><p>Mr. Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by assets or power plants, but his comments came on the same day Mr. Witkoff mentioned a “nuclear reactor” in an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-witkoff-middle-east-envoy-face-the-nation-transcript-03-16-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with CBS News</a>.</p><p>That appeared be a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, which Russia seized early in the war and still controls. The six-reactor plant is Europe’s largest, and its proximity to frontline fighting has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/world/europe/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-explainer.html" title="">long raised concerns</a> about the risk of a radiological disaster.</p><p>It was not immediately clear, though, whether any discussion about the power plant would focus on Russia giving it up — or finding a way to keep it under any truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The power plant sits near the Dnipro River in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, which Russia has officially annexed despite controlling only part of its territory. Surrendering it would mean ceding territory Russia considers its own. It would also give Kyiv’s troops a foothold in a Russian-controlled area that has been relatively protected from Ukrainian attacks thanks to the natural barrier of the large Dnipro River.</p><p>At the same time, energy experts say, the nuclear plant is in poor condition after three years of war and restoring full operations would require a lot of time and investment from Russia. That could mean Russia might see an incentive to try trading it in negotiations for something else, such as the easing of Western sanctions on the Russian economy, experts say.</p><h2 id="link-1a7310c">State of the war</h2></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-12"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="ukraine-russia-kursk-map-wqm7-" data-id="100000010045603" data-source-id="100000010045603"><div slug="ukraine-russia-kursk-map-wqm7-" data-sourceid="100000010045603" id="embed-id-100000010045603">
