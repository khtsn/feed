Putin of Russia ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” against Ukraine from Saturday evening through Sunday, declaring an “Easter truce” that appeared aimed at showing an impatient Trump administration that Moscow was still open to peace talks.</p><p>“We will assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example,” Mr. Putin said in a meeting televised on Saturday with his top military commander, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov.</p><p>Mr. Putin claimed that Kyiv’s response would shed light on Ukraine’s “desire, and, indeed, its ability” to take part in negotiations to end the war.</p><p>There was no immediate response from Ukraine.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-ceasefire.html" title="">Russia previously declared a unilateral truce</a> for the Eastern Orthodox Christmas in January 2023. At the time, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine dismissed the idea as cynical posturing meant to allow Russia to reposition soldiers and equipment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Shortly after the Kremlin released Mr. Putin’s comments, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that Russian forces would observe the Easter cease-fire “provided that it is mutually observed by the Kyiv regime.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
