Putin of Russia ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” against Ukraine from Saturday evening through Sunday, declaring an “Easter truce” that appeared aimed at showing an impatient Trump administration that Moscow was still open to peace talks.</p><p>“We will assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example,” Mr. Putin said in a meeting televised on Saturday with his top military commander, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov.</p><p>Mr. Putin claimed that Kyiv’s response would shed light on Ukraine’s “desire, and, indeed, its ability” to take part in negotiations to end the war.</p><p>In a post on social media an hour after Mr. Putin’s announcement, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine referred to it as Mr. Putin’s “next attempt to play with people’s lives.” Mr. Zelensky did not specify whether Ukraine would also observe a truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Air-raid sirens rang out in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, around 5 p.m. local time, an hour before Mr. Putin’s cease-fire was due to start.</p><p>“Ukrainian air defense and aviation have already begun working to defend themselves,” Mr. Zelensky said. Referring to Iranian-designed Russian drones, he went on: “Russian ‘Shaheds’ in our skies are Putin’s true attitude to Easter and to people’s lives.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-ceasefire.html" title="">Russia previously declared a unilateral truce</a> for the Eastern Orthodox Christmas in January 2023. At the time, Mr. Zelensky dismissed the idea as cynical posturing meant to allow Russia to reposition soldiers and equipment.</p><p>Shortly after the Kremlin released Mr. Putin’s comments, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that Russian forces would observe the Easter cease-fire “provided that it is mutually observed by the Kyiv regime.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In this photograph released by Russian state media, President Vladimir V.

Kirill Dmitriev, an envoy for Mr. Putin who traveled to Washington this month, <a href="https://x.com/kadmitriev/status/1913590007215858112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted the news on X</a>, adding, “One step closer to peace” and an emoji of a dove.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The move came a day after the Trump administration made its impatience plain with Russia’s unwillingness to agree to a monthlong cease-fire, which Ukraine said in March it was ready to observe.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that the United States could decide “in a matter of days” to “move on” from trying to end the war. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/trump-rubio-putin-ukraine.html" title="">President Trump said later</a> that “if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult,” the United States could decide that “we’re just going to take a pass.”</p><p>In his televised meeting on Saturday with General Gerasimov, Mr. Putin sought to portray Russia as seeking peace and Ukraine as the recalcitrant party. He said Russian forces needed to be ready “to repel possible cease-fire violations and provocations by the enemy.”</p><p>“We have always been ready” for peace talks, Mr. Putin said.</p><p>Referring to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and the informal club of nations that also includes Brazil, India and South Africa, Mr. Putin added that Russia welcomed “in every way the efforts of President Trump, our Chinese friends, the chairman of the People’s Republic of China, the BRICS countries and all supporters to achieve a fair and peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis.”</p><p>Kim Barker<!-- --> and <!-- -->Oleksandra Mykolyshyn<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
