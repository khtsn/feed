The defense has denied that Ms. Clark was ever kidnapped.</p><p>A longtime Combs associate who rose from personal assistant to a marketing director, Ms. Clark described the terrifying fallout after Mr. Combs discovered the relationship between Ms. Ventura, known as Cassie, and Mr. Mescudi.</p><p>Ms. Clark testified that after Mr. Combs kidnapped her, he threatened to kill her if she did not help him evade a police investigation into the break-in at Mr. Mescudi’s home. Later that day, she said, she watched Mr. Combs beat Ms. Ventura over what he viewed as a betrayal. “He repeatedly kicked her, and with each kick she would crouch more and more into a fetal position,” Ms. Clark said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/arts/music/kid-cudi-sean-combs-diddy-trial.html" title="">Mr. Mescudi testified that Mr. Combs’s meltdown</a> escalated to his Porsche being set on fire with a Molotov cocktail in early 2012.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Mr. Combs, testified on Tuesday about her experience working for Mr. Combs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office for the Southern District of New York</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Lawyers for Mr. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, have denied Mr. Combs’s involvement in any kidnapping or arson — and have said there was never any criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Ms. Clark said she was fired not long after reporting the kidnapping to an executive at Bad Boy, Mr. Combs’s record label. She said she later received a settlement from Mr. Combs over allegations of wrongful termination.</p><p>Under cross-examination from one of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, Ms. Clark acknowledged that last year, after the criminal investigation into Mr. Combs had begun, she expressed interest in working for the mogul again as his chief of staff.</p><p>Prosecutors have alleged that Mr. Combs’s associates kidnapped Ms. Clark another time — in 2004, shortly after she first began working for him as a personal assistant.</p><p>One day, Ms. Clark said, she realized that three pieces of diamond jewelry that were on loan to Mr. Combs had disappeared. After she reported the missing jewelry, she testified, she was subjected to five days of lie-detector tests to prove that she was not involved in the theft.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Each day, she was taken by a bodyguard for Mr. Combs to a “dilapidated” floor of a Manhattan office building that later became Mr. Combs’s corporate offices. An unnamed man who conducted the testing told her that if she failed, “they’re going to throw you in the East River.”</p><p>“I was petrified,” Ms. Clark said.</p><p>After Ms. Clark repeated those words, Mr. Combs, sitting at the defense table beside his lawyers, shook his head.</p><p>The kidnapping accusations are meant to buttress the racketeering conspiracy charge against Mr. Combs, which accuses him and members of his inner circle of a series of crimes dating back to 2004. The crimes cited in the indictment include sex trafficking, arson, drug violations, bribery, obstruction of justice and two acts of kidnapping — both of them involving Ms. Clark.</p><p>Two weeks into the trial, the witnesses have largely been aimed at corroborating Ms. Ventura’s account of rampant physical abuse and sexual encounters known as “freak-offs,” which she gave during four days of testimony at the start of the case.</p><p>The witnesses that followed have included people who say they witnessed Mr. Combs’s physical abuse of Ms. Ventura or its aftermath and two men who were paid to have sex with Ms. Ventura while Mr. Combs watched. Law enforcement officials have also described for the jury the searches they made of Mr. Combs’s property during the criminal investigation.</p><p>On Tuesday, more law enforcement officials are expected to take the stand, this time from the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department.</p><p>Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
