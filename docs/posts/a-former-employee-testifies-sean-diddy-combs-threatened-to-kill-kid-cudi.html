Lawyers for Mr. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, have denied that Ms. Clark was ever kidnapped — and have said there was never any criminal conspiracy.</p><p>A longtime Combs associate who rose from personal assistant to a fashion marketing director, Ms. Clark is the most prominent former employee to testify at the trial so far. It was not clear during her testimony why Mr. Combs was so adamant about her joining him on the trip to Mr. Mescudi’s house.</p><p>She grew distraught at times on the stand, removing her glasses to wipe tears from her eyes as she described the terrifying fallout after Mr. Combs discovered the relationship between Ms. Ventura, known as Cassie, and Mr. Mescudi.</p><p>Ms. Clark testified that after Mr. Combs kidnapped her, he threatened to kill her if she did not help him evade a police investigation into the break-in at Mr. Mescudi’s home. Later that day, she said, she watched Mr. Combs beat Ms. Ventura over what he viewed as a betrayal. “He repeatedly kicked her, and with each kick she would crouch more and more into a fetal position,” Ms. Clark said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/arts/music/kid-cudi-sean-combs-diddy-trial.html" title="">Mr. Mescudi testified that Mr. Combs’s meltdown</a> escalated to his Porsche being destroyed by a Molotov cocktail in early 2012. Mr. Combs’s lawyers denied the mogul’s involvement.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Mr. Combs, testified on Tuesday about her experience working for Mr. Combs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office for the Southern District of New York</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The cross-examination from one of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, sought to underscore how Ms. Clark repeatedly sought to return to work for Mr. Combs, despite the incidents she said she endured. Ms. Clark acknowledged that as recently as last year, after raids on Mr. Combs’s homes revealed that a criminal investigation of him was underway, she expressed interest in working for the mogul again — this time as his chief of staff.</p><p>While on the witness stand, Ms. Clark described her time working for Mr. Combs as a fast-paced “form of business school,” and an experience that had been characterized by inspiration — but also by fear.</p><p>It was only her first day on the job in 2004, she said, when Mr. Combs alluded to her previous experience working for a rival record producer, Suge Knight. Appearing to underscore his need for loyalty, he told her that “if anything happened, he would have to kill me,” she said.</p><p>Prosecutors have alleged that Mr. Combs’s associates kidnapped Ms. Clark another time — in 2004, shortly after she started work as a personal assistant.</p><p>One day, Ms. Clark said, she realized that three pieces of diamond jewelry that were on loan to Mr. Combs had disappeared. After she reported the missing jewelry, she testified, she was subjected to five days of lie-detector tests to prove that she was not involved in the theft.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Each day, she was taken by a bodyguard for Mr. Combs to a “dilapidated” floor of a Manhattan office building that later became Mr. Combs’s corporate offices. She said that an unnamed man who conducted the testing told her that if she failed, “they’re going to throw you in the East River.”</p><p>“I was petrified,” Ms. Clark said.</p><p>After Ms. Clark repeated those words, Mr. Combs, sitting at the defense table beside his lawyers, shook his head.</p><p>The kidnapping accusations are meant to buttress the racketeering conspiracy charge against Mr. Combs, which accuses him and members of his inner circle of a series of crimes dating back to 2004. The crimes cited in the indictment include sex trafficking, arson, drug violations, bribery, obstruction of justice and the two acts of kidnapping.</p><p>Ms. Clark worked for Mr. Combs in periods between 2004 and 2018, though she left multiple times over disputes with her boss.</p><p>In 2006, Ms. Clark said, she left her job after Mr. Combs “charged” at her in response to another employee reporting to him that Ms. Clark had expressed dissatisfaction about her job.</p><p>She later returned, but she said she was fired in 2012, after reporting the 2011 kidnapping to executives at Bad Boy, Mr. Combs’s record label. At that time, Mr. Combs told her that she would “never work again,” she said, and she later received a settlement from Mr. Combs over allegations of wrongful termination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But Ms. Clark returned again in 2016 to work as creative director to Ms. Ventura, who was a singer on Mr. Combs’s label. She described Mr. Combs directing the minutiae of Ms. Ventura’s music career, including her schedule and what she wore on the red carpet.</p><p>“Soup to nuts, we needed to get approval,” she said.</p><p>Two weeks into the trial, the witnesses have largely been aimed at corroborating Ms. Ventura’s account of living under intense control, enduring rampant physical abuse and participating in sexual encounters known as “freak-offs,” which she gave during four days of testimony during the first week of testimony.</p><p>The witnesses that followed have included people who say they witnessed Mr. Combs’s physical abuse of Ms. Ventura or its aftermath, and two men who were paid to have sex with her while Mr. Combs watched. The defense asserts that Ms. Ventura and another woman that Mr. Combs is accused of sex trafficking are not victims, but rather former girlfriends who agreed to participate in sex that, while “kinky,” was entirely consensual and legal.</p><p>Law enforcement officials have also described for the jury the searches they made of Mr. Combs’s property during the criminal investigation.</p><p>On Tuesday, more law enforcement officials are expected to take the stand, this time from the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department.</p><p>Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
