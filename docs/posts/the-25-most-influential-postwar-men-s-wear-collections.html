    <h1>The 25 Most Influential Postwar Men’s Wear Collections</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><p>In 2022, we compiled a list of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/t-magazine/fashion-influential-womens-collections.html" title="">25 most influential postwar women’s wear collections</a>. To do the same for men’s wear, we first had to assemble a group of esteemed jurors: the Colombian-born French fashion designer Haider Ackermann; Emily Adams Bode Aujla, the American founder of Bode, a brand known for its vintage-inspired men’s wear; T’s men’s style director, David Farber; the New York-based stylist, creative consultant and T contributor Carlos Nazario; and the New York-based Canadian photographer and creative director Tommy Ton. This past April, on a video call that lasted almost three hours, the group debated the merits of 50 collections, with each panelist making the case for the 10 or so that they’d been asked to nominate beforehand. Although there were favorites (four jurors picked at least one Giorgio Armani and Comme des Garçons collection), there were also some upsets (the inclusion of Helmut Lang over his minimalist peers Calvin Klein and Jil Sander) and a few difficult conversations. Could the group, for example, justify putting Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, a mall retailer with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/17/us/clothing-chain-accused-of-discrimination.html" title="">checkered</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/supreme-court-rules-in-samantha-elauf-abercrombie-fitch-case.html" title="">past</a>, on the same list as Junya Watanabe and Dries Van Noten?</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/t-magazine/fashion/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/t-magazine/fashion/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/t-magazine/fashion/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A collage of six people." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/t-magazine/fashion/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/t-magazine/fashion/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/t-magazine/fashion/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/t-magazine/fashion/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN/5tmag-tlist-a-kimmel-slide-9FXN-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The T editor at large and the conversation’s moderator, Nick Haramis (bottom right) with the panelists Carlos Nazario (clockwise from top left), Emily Adams Bode Aujla, Tommy Ton, Haider Ackermann and David Farber.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As we worked to cut the list by half, the goal was to identify a collection’s impact — whether that was reinventing the shape of the suit or challenging what it means to “dress like a man” in the first place. That the outcome would be somewhat subjective was a given; but as always, there were rules: Similar to the women’s wear list, which took Christian Dior’s postwar New Look as its rough starting point, anything before 1945 was disqualified. Nor did a collection need to have been shown on a runway. Everyone agreed not to include the designs of fellow panelists, which was difficult: Bode Aujla, whose garments mix workwear with traditionally female-driven crafts such as quilting and appliqué, has been named men’s wear designer of the year twice, in 2021 and 2022, by the Council of Fashion Designers of America; Ackermann, who’s known for his romantic draping and sharp tailoring, just became the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/style/haider-ackermann-tom-ford.html" title="">new creative director of Tom Ford</a>.</p><p>In the end, this list, which appears in roughly the order it was discussed — rather than in any kind of ranking — is weighted toward more recent offerings, but for good reason. For much of contemporary history, male dress codes reflected a rigid and increasingly outdated notion of masculinity. In 1950, John C. Wood, the president of Brooks Brothers, one of America’s oldest apparel companies, said to a reporter, “They call us conservative, but we think that our styles are simply lacking the bizarre.” Even into the 1960s, it seemed like men had two basic style options: Savile Row-style tailoring or a pair of jeans. But as the definition of manhood expanded, men’s wear became less predictable and more complex: In the 1970s, Vivienne Westwood’s tattered shirts and spiky leather jackets epitomized the nonconformity of the punk movement; the following decade, Jean Paul Gaultier put men in skirts when such a thing raised eyebrows. But it wasn’t until 2001 that the French couturier, who noticed his male clients getting pickier and more provocative about how they dressed, said, “The fashion world is now claiming that men are becoming more like women when it comes to clothes. … I like that idea.” For the most part, so did the panelists. — <em>Nick Haramis</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>The conversation has been edited and condensed.</em></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-4b7823e2">1.

When it came to men’s fashion, that meant voluminous silhouettes, which nobody did quite like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/13/t-magazine/giorgio-armani-fashion-photographs.html" title="">Giorgio Armani</a>. The Italian designer began making suits in the 1960s, but his clothing catapulted into American closets in 1980 when he created the wardrobe for Richard Gere’s character in the Paul Schrader film “<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/required-viewing-american-gigolo/" title="">American Gigolo</a>.” (The message was clear: wearing a suit as good as that could excuse almost any bad behavior.) Over the following decade, Armani’s clothes, which started out as exquisite interpretations of the classics, got progressively looser and more innovative, culminating in his spring 1989 collection, which featured double pleats, floor-skimming cuffs, wide lapels and big pockets. The lighter fabrics of the season (including wool crepe and linen) further enhanced the lack of structure and, when models wore the long double-breasted jackets — not a shoulder pad in sight — the slouch of the cloth recalled the hang of a pocket watch’s chain. The advertising campaigns were photographed by Aldo Fallai, a frequent collaborator of Armani’s, with some of the models instructed to look directly into the camera. “Giorgio developed the men’s waistline, which is something nobody was doing before,” Fallai <a href="https://system-magazine.com/issues/issue-3/aldo-fallai" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a 2014 interview</a>. “The waistline became wider by going higher.” At 90, Armani still oversees his brand, but that 1989 collection remains the most enduring articulation of his signature style. <em>— Rose Courteau</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Looks from the spring 1989 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Giorgio Armani</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>David Farber:</strong> For me, there are three designers — Giorgio Armani, Hedi Slimane and Thom Browne — who changed the way men dressed through the silhouettes they introduced. And in all three cases, it came down to a staple: the suit. First and foremost, there’s Mr. Armani, who threw everything we’d come to know about men’s tailoring — particularly from brands like Brooks Brothers, which weren’t as much about comfort or ease — out the window. Gone was the idea of a sharp crease. He introduced a kind of rumpled chic, and a ton of gray and beige.</p><p><strong>Emily Adams Bode Aujla:</strong> The campaigns by Aldo Fallai are burned in my head; the clothes speak for themselves in those pictures. If you think about what was happening in America at that time — “The Godfather” (1972) had come out in theaters the previous decade — Armani’s clothes were a complete rejection of what we thought of as elevated Italian fashion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>In a circa 1980 interview, Armani discusses his approach to men’s wear.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>You should never forget that men’s dress should almost always be understated. That is to say, one’s personality shouldn’t take over. One should dress in a fairly sober manner, speaking in general, and avoid being too exhibitionist. He shouldn’t expose himself too much, and get people to turn around for him on the street. That is the standard that I believe a man should always keep in mind. That is not because of a matter of virility or of displaying one’s masculinity, but because I believe that looking at a person, you should be able to grasp his personality.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/t-magazine/fashion/Screenshot-2024-09-04-at-10/Screenshot-2024-09-04-at-10-superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In a circa 1980 interview, Armani discusses his approach to men’s wear.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Carlos Nazario:</strong> He changed the way men presented themselves in the street.

Before the French-born Tunisian Italian designer’s first show as creative director of Dior Homme in 2001, the dominant silhouette had been looser and less constructed — thanks in large part to the influence of Armani. Slimane raised armholes, made the silhouette slimmer, cinched waists and sent a mix of boyish professional and street-cast models down the runway. He caused such a seismic style shift that Karl Lagerfeld would later say that Slimane’s clothes were the reason he felt compelled to go on a diet. In 1996, Pierre Bergé, Yves Saint Laurent’s longtime partner in business and life, hired Slimane, who had no formal academic design training, to be the director of the men’s collections at Saint Laurent. (He would return 16 years later as the house’s artistic director.) It was there that he first introduced the world to his sexy, mysterious underground club kid look — which also reflected his personal style. At Dior Homme, he leaned even further into his own point of view. Following his debut there, which felt more like a rock concert — with models in sequined pants, shimmering fabrics and unbuttoned shirts — Saint Laurent himself, who sat front row with Bergé, led a standing ovation. — <em>Emilia Petrarca</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Looks from the fall 2001 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jean-Luce Huré for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>Farber:</strong> It was all there from the beginning — that razor-sharp, superslim silhouette.</p><p><strong>Nazario:</strong> I remember suddenly wanting to be <em>really</em> skinny.</p><p><strong>Farber:</strong> You and Karl.</p><p><strong>Haramis:</strong> That look had such a chokehold on anyone who lived in New York at the time.</p><p><strong>Farber:</strong> It wasn’t just special-occasion dressing; it was about who you wanted to be.</p><p><strong>Tommy Ton:</strong> That skinny silhouette had also been attributed to Raf [Simons].

Two years later, the American designer from Allentown, Pa. — who got his start as an account executive at Giorgio Armani’s New York showroom and then worked as the men’s creative director of Club Monaco — made his New York Fashion Week debut. From the start, the hallmarks of Browne’s now instantly recognizable style were in evidence: shrunken proportions, a gray color palette, Pee-wee Herman-esque whimsy. But it took a few years to fully realize the Thom Browne universe as we know it today. For fall 2007, as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZZGZo5luzI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fourth movement</a> of Gustav Mahler’s “Symphony no. 5” played, he sent out a parade of muscular models in dramatically undersize suits and extra-long, Scrooge-like sleeping caps. There were plaid jackets and skirts, voluminous capes and even a bridal train for the finale. As the critic Tim Blanks wrote of the collection, “It’s simply not possible for men’s wear to ever be the same again.” —<em> E.P.</em></p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-22"><div><figcaption><span>Looks from the fall 2007 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Courtesy of Thom Browne</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>Farber:</strong> People were very confused by those shrunken suits.

Kawakubo, who had been attracting attention beyond her native Japan for her unstructured silhouettes, ripped fabrics and dark colors, debuted a line of men’s basics, Comme des Garçons Homme, in 1978. It wasn’t until her spring 1985 collection, though, that she added high-end men’s wear, launching her Homme Plus collection in the alleyway behind Comme des Garçons’ Paris headquarters. Less gothic than her earlier creations, the clothes were modeled by artists and other creative people who walked the runway in loose, ankle-skimming trousers that alluded to traditional Japanese <em>hakama</em> pants. On top, she played with the silhouette of jackets, incorporating extra lining in some areas and leaving other parts unlined. Much of it was made from dyed cotton and linen in a limited palette of blue, white, black and gray. Though Kawakubo has famously rejected conventional ideas of wearability — a women’s collection from 1997, for instance, used fabric stuffing to create giant protrusions on various parts of the body — her slouchy, nonchalant vision remains quite relevant. This 1985 collection also drew the attention of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, who would <a href="https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/journal/fashion/one-memorable-look-jean-michel-basquiat-comme-des-garcons-10411640" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">walk in the spring Homme Plus show</a> two years later. — <em>R.C.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-30"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The designer Rei Kawakubo in 1985.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thomas Iannaccone/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Image</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Another look from the spring 1985 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Comme des Garçons</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p><strong>Farber:</strong> There’ve been so many amazing Comme des Garçons shows, so I went back to the beginning.

Poetically unkempt guys everywhere found a home in those rumpled suits, untucked shirts and cropped trousers. The natural fabrics were often dyed with indigo and mud to look worn in and faded.

With the sun beating down on Paris’s Palais-Royal, the American designer, a trained architect and founder of the streetwear brand Off-White, sent a cast of ethnically diverse models (and a few musician friends like Kid Cudi, Steve Lacy and Playboi Carti) down an ombré rainbow runway in sharply tailored suits with puffer jackets and hoodies. He turned bags, wallets and card holders into apparel, merging them with holsters, vests and harnesses. And in titling the show We Are the World — a reference to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3wNuru4U0I" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1985 charity single</a> written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie — and inviting 1,500 students of all ages to sit alongside front-row regulars like Rihanna and ASAP Rocky, he made a powerful statement about the future of the industry. “There are people [here] who look like me,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/fashion/louis-vuitton-virgil-abloh-paris.html" title="">he told the Times</a>. “You never saw that before in fashion.” Abloh’s own story ended abruptly in 2021 when he died of cancer at age 41. — <em>Kin Woo</em></p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-36"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: the musician Steve Lacy, who walked in the spring 2019 show, backstage; a look from the collection; a model backstage at the show; Playboi Carti on the runway.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Courtesy of Louis Vuitton</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p><strong>Farber:</strong> I have a fond memory of being there. But looking at it again, I didn’t realize how it sort of lives on from that moment to the present day. The mix of tailoring and sportswear and even accessories — it seemed organic. Now I feel like accessories are being pushed down our throats, even if they don’t always feel connected to the clothes. But here, the guy who wore that suit also had that bag. There was so much hype around that show. But when I look at it now, it’s not about hype. It was about things like inclusivity. There were even touches of whimsy in the set, which had a “Wizard of Oz” theme.</p><p><strong>Nazario:</strong> It was cheesy. We arrived onto the yellow brick road.

And then there’s the obvious impact of that show: the casting; the emotion in the room, which I’d never felt before and haven’t felt again; and what Vuitton meant for the wearer from that moment on. It forever changed the way fashion houses choose who gets those jobs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><p><h2 id="link-3391b7cd">6.

But it took almost a decade for the brand to present runway shows solely dedicated to men’s wear, which it did in 1997, under the direction of Mrs. Prada, as she’s known, and the English designer Neil Barrett, who worked under her as design director. For the spring 1999 season, Prada’s men’s runway presentation included the debut of the Linea Rossa collection, which would become hugely successful. Though Prada wasn’t the first luxury house to make sportswear, what it was proposing — a quieter style that straddled the line between business casual and activewear, with none of the loud branding and logos of most athletic gear — was wholly new. In short, this was the birth of athleisure. The collection included traditional suiting in Prada’s now-signature silhouette — a relaxed, slightly wide shoulder with shortened lapels — as well as weekend staples like windbreakers, anoraks and ergonomic sling bags. “Our idea is to mix technology with normal dressing,” Mrs. Prada said around that time. “In the long term, I see formal dressing for special occasions and an increasing number of people wearing sportswear almost all day long.” — <em>Jameson Montgomery</em></p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-44"><div><figcaption><span>Looks from the spring 1999 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Courtesy of Prada</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><p><strong>Ton:</strong> It was athleisure before we knew the term.

In place of his usual tailored jackets and vests and pleated trousers, there were bulky scarves and kaffiyehs worn over layers of oversize trench coats, bomber jackets and hooded sweatshirts. Titled Riot Riot Riot, the collection was a departure from Simons’s earlier attempts to make more conventional men’s wear feel cool. Instead he refined the dingy uniforms of youth, creating a type of streetwear well before the term was talked about in fashion circles.

But in 1990, the Florentine fashion house found an unlikely savior: a relatively untested Texan named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/tom-ford" title="">Tom Ford</a>, who, at age 29, was hired to lead the women’s ready-to-wear division. A success from the start, he took over men’s wear soon after and was appointed creative director in 1994. Ford reimagined Gucci’s runway shows, doing away with the industry-standard white cube venue and plunging audiences into darkness to ensure that all eyes were on the individually spotlighted models. For spring 1997, he presented a largely black collection for men and women that made a statement, intentional or not, about gender equality: For the most part, it was the guys who were nearly naked. Though the lineup did include high-sheen overcoats and plenty of knitwear, nearly every man with a shirt on had it unbuttoned to his navel or completely open. Sweaters were of a loose enough gauge to be almost transparent, and one was paired with only boxer briefs. Near the show’s end, two models — a man and a woman, one after the other — came out in matching thongs each held together by the house’s intersecting monogram. — <em>J.M.</em></p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-58"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/05/autossell/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-4/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-4-superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A backstage interview with the fashion designer Tom Ford following the spring 1997 show.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p><strong>Bode Aujla:</strong> I picked this collection largely because of that girl and guy in the G-strings.

The clothes were much looser, more casual and, in a sense, sportier than what other designers were showing, with garments layered in the way an athlete might style shorts over leggings. Some of the shoulders were tailored to point slightly upward — perhaps a nod to one of Owens’s favorite musicians, Gene Simmons from the band Kiss.

I think that first Paris collection solidified the statement he’s made on men’s wear. Starting with fall 2009, Rick has been very consistent with an elongated top, drop-crotch pants or long linear gown and stomping boots. The Pitti Uomo collection that David mentioned felt a bit more rock ’n’ roll. In fall 2009, he’s exploring that gothic or monastic silhouette that would go on to permeate his later collections. That’s when he really started having fun.</p><p><strong>Bode Aujla:</strong> I think Tommy’s right. The clothes in that other collection just aren’t as Rick defining.

With the headline “<a href="https://archive.vogue.com/article/1999/10/1/puffy-takes-paris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Puffy Takes Paris</a>,” the story centers the American rapper and producer — who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/arts/music/diddy-sean-combs-businesses-raid.html" title="">settled a lawsuit with his former girlfriend</a> last year that included allegations of physical abuse and rape, and who has since been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diddy-sean-combs-lawsuit-allegations.html" title="">accused in multiple lawsuits of sexual abuse and other offenses</a>, all of which he has denied — alongside the model Kate Moss and the designers Oscar de la Renta, Jean Paul Gaultier and Karl Lagerfeld. The year before, he’d founded his own sportswear label, Sean John, one of the first of his many entrepreneurial ventures beyond music. The brand became a beacon for the convergence of fashion, hip-hop and Hollywood. Nowhere was that mix more apparent than at the fall 2003 Sean John runway show. Celebrities weren’t only in the audience but also on the runway, and the then-unknown actor Channing Tatum modeled a fur-collared coat over a pair of white long underwear. The looks offered a New York rap fantasy: sunglasses-inside swagger, puffer coats and suits with silk ties.

Before its launch, Puffy had been an arbiter of culture who could sell anything. But this was the moment when people started taking him seriously as a designer, which, for better or worse, cemented him as a presence in the fashion industry. The look — glamorous, ostentatious and sort of tacky — was everywhere. And I thought it was done well this season.

But while the French designer was amplifying a burlesque ideal of femininity, he was also queering gendered ideas of fashion with his spring 1985 men’s collection, titled Et Dieu Créa l’Homme (And God Created Man), which included sarongs and wide-leg trousers with wrapped front panels that made them look like skirts. The year before, Gaultier had incorporated the sailor stripe into his Boy Toy collection for men, citing Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s homoerotic 1982 film “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/movies/querelle-anthology-film-archives.html" title="">Querelle</a>” (based on the 1947 Jean Genet novel) as inspiration. Promotional images for the collection showed a tall, muscular man in a short plaid skirt standing on a dock next to a woman in a longer pant-skirt combo, their stomachs peeking out from nearly identical cropped sweaters. Although mainstream fashion didn’t adopt Gaultier’s then-radical concept, he was able to expand the outermost boundary of men’s wear, creating space for other designers to explore and, more distantly, for the likes of Harry Styles and ASAP Rocky to experiment. —<em> R.C.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-76"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier, photographed in 1984 in one of his skirt suits.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">© Richard Kalvar/Magnum Photos</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Models in looks from the spring 1985 men’s and women’s collections.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guy Marineau/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-36"><div><p><strong>Farber:</strong> It can be a bit of an eye roll now to hear about skirts on the runway.

The performance complemented the electric day-to-night feeling of the collection, with its leather jackets, oversize graphic tees and sweatsuits spliced with laces. “I went to high school with all these guys out there vogueing today,” Oliver <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/post-apocalyptic-warriors-and-voguing-on-the-runway-at-hood-by-air-mens-fall-2014" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Vogue after the show</a>. “The way I view design comes from the aesthetic of being at a ball.” — <em>Jessica Testa</em></p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-80"><div><figcaption><span>From left: a look from the fall 2014 collection; models backstage at the show.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>From left: Joe Kohen/Getty Images; Dominique Maître/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images; Monica Schipper/Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-38"><div><p><strong>Nazario:</strong> This was the moment when everyone was like, “What <em>is</em> this?” It was so charged and messy, borderline vulgar. The vision was fully realized, but the budgets were just so small. And that was its charm. I think it really influenced the way that fashion used communities, the way that clothes were presented and who was allowed to have an opinion. Shayne was influenced by what was happening in Europe; it’s probably valid to say there was a conversation going on between Shayne, Rick [Owens] and Riccardo [Tisci].

Splashy, menacing images of the dog appeared on sweatshirts, scarves and shorts — though the Italian designer later played down the breed’s ferocity, <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/riccardo-tisci-gq-designer-of-the-year-2012" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying that Rottweilers represent</a> “power and sweetness.” The black jersey shirts were particularly favored by Rihanna, Usher and several members of the Kardashian-Jenner family, who wore them in numerous paparazzi photos. It’s now a requirement for designers to have street credibility and a crew of famous friends, but that started with Tisci’s 12-year reign at Givenchy. (He began by overseeing the couture and women’s lines in 2005 and added men’s wear in 2008.) Dark and seductive, his Givenchy was also slyly witty: That 2011 collection included fuzzy hats with dog ears. — <em>J.T.</em></p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-87"><div><figcaption><span>Looks from the fall 2011 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>From left: Karl Prouse/Catwalking/Getty Images; Alain Gil-Gonzalez/Abaca Press/Alamy; Karl Prouse/Catwalking/Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-41"><div><p><strong>Ton:</strong> It was a pivotal moment to see a luxury house like Givenchy tackling streetwear.

After graduating from New York University in 2001, the American designer traveled to Italy to work with tailors and patternmakers and returned home with a small collection of thoughtfully constructed essentials. Three weeks later, he threw his latest collection in a duffel bag and flew to Paris to try to sell it. (The store Colette bought almost everything; eventually, the brand was carried at Bergdorf Goodman and then Dover Street Market, following a studio visit from Rei Kawakubo herself.) Kimmel made clothes that evoked larger-than-life characters. For his early look books, he and his half brother, the photographer Alexei Hay, played dress up with their friends: the actor Dennis Hopper and the artists Ryan McGinley, John Baldessari and Dan Colen. In later seasons, his presentations were increasingly cinematic, demonstrating his showmanship and range. Spring 2010, one of the brand’s last collections, channeled a Western aesthetic with suede chaps and denim coveralls. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/magazine/jim-krantzs-wild-west.html" title="">Jim Krantz</a>, who photographed original Marlboro Man ads, shot the collection on real cowboys on a ranch in New Mexico; <a href="https://www.adamkimmel.com/projects/v/j8zbekmjyrb84h4psbeh6kwedxbeez" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an accompanying video</a> by the director Meredith Danluck, the bull rider Rocky McDonald mounted a bucking bronco in a Kimmel tuxedo. — <em>E.P.</em></p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-92"><div><figcaption><span>Looks from the spring 2010 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Courtesy of Adam Kimmel</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-43"><div><p><strong>Ackermann:</strong> These days, there’re so many collections based on outerwear.

In 1968, Lauren, who was born Ralph Lipschitz in the Bronx, came out with his first Polo label collection. (Despite never having played the sport, he loved its style.) He quickly became known for textured fabrics — tweed, silk, corduroy — and relaxed tailoring, as epitomized by his unstructured Easy Suit, introduced in 1970. “The coat feels like a shirt and looks like a jacket,” he said. In 1974, he released a collection of double-breasted waistcoats, suits with big lapels and wide ties that Robert Redford wore in that year’s film adaptation of the 1925 F.

They changed the store’s name several times before landing, in 1976, on Seditionaries. By then, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/sex-pistols" title="">Sex Pistols</a>, whom McLaren managed, were wearing clothes from the shop.

More intricately detailed pieces included the famous bondage suit from the 1976 collection, a unisex ensemble with an abundance of zippers and buckles.

Two decades earlier, though, in 1976, the company had filed for bankruptcy. It found its footing again in 1992, when a new chief executive, Mike Jeffries, was hired following the brand’s purchase a few years earlier by the Limited, Inc. His plan: to attract adolescent customers with a sexy take on collegiate Americana involving rugby polos, cargo shorts and a lot of plaid. The company commissioned the photographer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/mario-testino-bruce-weber-harassment.html" title="">Bruce Weber</a> to shoot black-and-white, often homoerotic pictures that were printed on shopping bags and lined the walls of Abercrombie’s cologne-scented, wood-paneled stores, where customers were usually met by shirtless male greeters. The company was later criticized for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/17/us/clothing-chain-accused-of-discrimination.html" title="">exclusionary marketing and hiring practices</a>, which favored slim, white models and employees and, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-67991750" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the F.B.I. launched an investigation</a> into claims that Jeffries sexually abused several men between 2009 and 2015; Jeffries has denied these claims.

Recently, Abercrombie has undergone yet another successful rebrand with more sophisticated clothes for a slightly older clientele: In the first quarter of 2024, sales were up 31 percent over the year before. And yet, as cargo shorts return to the runway once more, the influence that Abercrombie had on young millennials — and on men’s style — is hard to deny. — <em>J.M.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-109"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Abercrombie &amp; Fitch billboard, photographed in 2005 on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Richard B.

From the moment the first model came out in Milan wearing a red silk pussy-bow blouse with loose cotton pants and fur-lined sandals, it was clear that the Italian designer had cast aside Giannini’s jet-set aesthetic in favor of his own vintage-inspired vision. Romantic and exuberantly androgynous, the collection featured wool berets, skinny scarves and lace tops, all worn by willowy models. Two days after his first men’s show, Michele was appointed creative director of the brand, a position he would hold for nearly eight years before stepping down in 2022. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/t-magazine/alessandro-michele-gucci-interview.html" title="">As Frank Bruni wrote for T in 2018</a>, “He isn’t just selling robes, slippers, handbags, <em>things</em>, though he certainly wants customers to buy those, which they’ve done in numbers that have returned Gucci to peak cultural relevance and extraordinary financial success. He’s selling a <em>sensibility</em>: eccentric, eclectic, inclusive.” (And one that was exuberantly bizarre: he’d sometimes send out models with their identical twins or carrying silicone heads that looked just like theirs.)

A few years later, the label hired the Dutch designer Lucas Ossendrijver, hoping that he’d do the same for men’s wear. While Elbaz was best known for his festive, formal attire, Ossendrijver, who had previously worked under Slimane at Dior Homme, was interested in “lived-in” clothes, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/meet-lucas-ossendrijver/" title="">he told T in 2008</a>; he found traditional suits “boring.” By the summer of 2010, when he showed his spring 2011 collection in Paris, he’d refined a casual yet elegant aesthetic inspired by activewear and aerodynamic design. Semi-sheer tops twisted around torsos. Hems and seams were left raw. Fabrics were tactile, some of them stiff and ridged and others imprinted with swirls and stripes. The athletic sandals combined lizard skin with sporty straps. Long sleeveless jackets were worn over bare chests, accessorized with metallic studded necklaces. Commercial success followed, pushing Lanvin further toward cultural relevance. In 2010, H&amp;M released a very popular men’s and women’s collaboration with the brand and, in 2013, Lanvin became the official tailor of England’s Arsenal Football Club.

She held her first Paris runway show in 1991, adding men’s wear in 1996, and through it all delivered goth nobility: Her clothing was moody, sophisticated and often black. But for her spring 2014 men’s wear collection, the designer surprised her audience with florals. Though the blooms were ebony-hued, the wisteria appliqués creeping down the tongues of white shoes and swirling around the chests of blush pink vests were also distinctly pretty. The collection evoked Edwardian tea parties, with domed hats, three-piece suits and vertical stripes — some barely visible beneath buttoned tailcoats and others blaring from trousers. It was unexpectedly whimsical, even Tim Burton-esque. (One journalist used the description “Beetlejuice stripes.”) “This is private Ann, on Sundays,” <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-menswear/ann-demeulemeester" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Demeulemeester told Vogue at the time</a>. “People don’t know, but I love my garden.” It was her last men’s collection before stepping away from the brand. — <em>J.T.</em></p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-126"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Details from the spring 2014 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Firstview</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stripes and flowers on the runway.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Firstview</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-59"><div><p><strong>Ackermann:</strong> It’s clothes with a soul, and maybe I’ve been missing that.

A tweed jacket, worn over a polka-dot tie, was fastened with a safety pin. Punkish snagged sweaters were layered over sensible shirts. A top hat and brogues complemented jeans covered in plaid patches. It was a city kid remix of Ralph Lauren’s Anglophilia, and the dichotomy was irresistible.

At his fall 2016 men’s wear show, that rich-bohemian romanticism found its ideal habitat: the Palais Garnier opera house in Paris, a venue that he’d been trying to book for 15 years. <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-menswear/dries-van-noten" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He told Vogue at the time</a> that he wanted to create a collection that matched its grandeur. “For me it was really good to be able to show here onstage and not in a room,” he said. “It turns your world a little bit upside down.” According to the show notes, Van Noten based the clothes on a central character that he referred to as a “Peacock Peacenik,” and looked to the psychedelic imagery of the 1960s to inform many of his designs. Some coats were covered with swirly, hallucinogenic graphics by the artist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/arts/design/wes-wilson-dead.html" title="">Wes Wilson</a>, who designed fliers for Ken Kesey’s original acid tests, others with military ribbons and symbols. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/23/style/dries-van-noten-fashion-shows-paris.html" title="">Van Noten’s spring 2025</a> men’s wear show this past June was his last one.

We then went up a creaky staircase and through a little door, which is when we realized that we were on the stage of this amazing architectural gem. The collection was in part military inspired, so there’s an officer’s coat and lots of olive. Eventually, we started to see some embellishment — maybe an embroidered snake down one arm.

Tired of wearing hand-me-down suits to school, he learned to sew his own jeans. When he founded his own line in Paris in 1986, he focused on the clean-lined, workwear-like silhouettes that defined his youth. America was an enduring creative touchstone for the designer; in 1997, he moved his business to New York and, that summer, he showed the spring 1998 collection, his first dedicated to men’s wear. The lineup of largely black-and-white tailoring included vests that resembled bulletproof tactical gear, utilitarian belts worn like cummerbunds and lots of denim, most notably in the form of Lang’s famous paint-splattered carpenter jeans, which inspired countless imitations. In promoting garments of humble American origin, Lang challenged the supremacy of European fashion; the following year, he even pushed the date of his women’s show up a month to precede the ones in Milan and Paris. Other designers soon followed his lead and New York has been first on the official fashion calendar ever since. — <em>J.M.</em></p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-142"><div><figcaption><span>Looks from the spring 1998 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Firstview</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-66"><div><p><strong>Farber:</strong> Jil Sander and Calvin Klein’s influence on men’s wear was huge, but I chose Helmut because he took that minimalism and built on it. Over the years, he played with punk and New Wave influences. There’s so much in this spring 1998 collection: sharp tailoring and monochrome dressing, but also the idea of modern armor with the inclusion of a padded bulletproof vest and suiting with a distressed denim jacket and paint-splattered jeans.</p><p><strong>Nazario:</strong> It felt like the convergence of a lot of things that were happening in fashion, but in a very concise way. And I love the introduction of a lot of urban styling cues like wearing a tank top underneath a white shirt. From that time forward, I don’t think there’s been a moment when Helmut wasn’t a part of the conversation.</p><p><strong>Ton:</strong> To me, 1998 was the year of Helmut. The unfussiness of a simple suit contrasted with utilitarian garments like a worker vest was such an interesting proposition. This collection also merged high fashion with streetwear.</p><p><strong>Ackermann:</strong> I’ve gone to a few of his shows; the models seemed to walk straight at you. There was no gimmick.

In January 2015, when she was 24, she debuted her clothes, which bring together indigenous craft techniques, including Indian quilting, Ghanaian beading and Burkinabe weaving with Savile Row-like tailoring, as part of the emerging designer showcase Fashion East at London Fashion Week. Wales Bonner — who has since curated exhibitions at New York’s <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5637" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Art</a> and London’s <a href="https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/grace-wales-bonner-time-new-dreams/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serpentine North Gallery</a> — sought inspiration for the collection, titled Ebonics, in the work of Black writers and artists like Langston Hughes and Marlon Riggs. She subverted expectations about gender and class with combinations such as a silk cummerbund with a pinstriped-denim suit and a halter top with high-waisted trousers or a mushroom-colored, crushed velvet suit embellished with cowrie shells and Swarovski crystals. — <em>K.W.</em></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-147"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner (center), photographed in 2016 after winning the LVMH Prize at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-68"><div><p><strong>Farber:</strong> I remember being in London with a colleague who said, “We should go see this new designer Grace Wales Bonner.” I didn’t know anything about her.

In the show notes, Grace wrote, “This collection was quite historical, going further into the history of how Black people were represented in paintings in the 19th century, and how that manifests itself today. It’s about looking back and then looking forward.” To be so young and to carry that kind of weight — I’m not surprised by how successful a career she’s had.</p><p><strong>Nazario:</strong> I’m a big Grace fan, and I think the way she makes work inspires a lot of designers.</p><h2 id="link-41f612f7">25.

But for his spring 2015 show, Green stripped back the conceptual statements and focused instead on the construction, telling Dazed magazine that he wanted the clothes “to feel beautiful, in a way.” The core of the collection was a utilitarian workwear jacket made of cotton, nylon and tarpaulin that he interpreted in a limited palette of white, black and a supersaturated cornflower blue. Worn by barefoot models who emerged to a melancholic soundtrack that included the Irish New Age singer Enya, the garment looked almost delicate, with strings that tied at the front.
