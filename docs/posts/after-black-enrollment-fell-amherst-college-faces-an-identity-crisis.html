Some schools saw only minor changes in their enrollment makeup, according to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/15/upshot/college-enrollment-race.html" title="">analysis</a> by The New York Times.</p><p>But at others, including Amherst, Black and Hispanic enrollment declined sharply last fall — the first class affected by the new ruling — with Amherst experiencing one of the steepest drops. Hispanic enrollment in Amherst’s freshman class dropped to 8 percent last fall, compared with 12 percent a year earlier. </p><p>The Trump administration is trying to use that Supreme Court case to increase the pressure on universities to eliminate diversity efforts. It is promising to punish schools it believes might be circumventing the decision. The moves have added to the tension at schools like Amherst as they try to avoid legal challenges, but also face faculty, students and alumni urging their school to fight back. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Conservatives argue diversity efforts meant to boost Black, Hispanic and other groups have resulted in discrimination against Asian and white students, the contention that formed the crux of the Supreme Court case. “Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” the Supreme Court said in its decision. </p><p>Despite the decision, Michael A. Elliott, Amherst’s president, said the school’s 200-year-old mission, which emphasizes educating students from all <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/about/president-college-leadership/mission" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backgrounds</a>, has not changed.</p><p>“My goal is to be able to execute our mission and to do so in a way that’s in compliance with the law,” Dr. Elliott said in a telephone interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural of notable alumni at the Black Student Union.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Amherst was one of the first highly selective colleges to eliminate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/amherst-college-legacy-admissions.html" title="">legacy</a> preferences, which tend to favor white students. It was also the lead author of a brief in the Supreme Court case arguing for the “educational benefits of a diverse student body and the societal benefits of educating diverse future leaders.” </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the brief, Amherst argued that eliminating race-conscious admissions would “have a drastic resegregating impact” and predicted it could lose about half its enrollment of Native American, Black and Hispanic students.</p><p>Since that prediction largely came true, many at Amherst are concerned that fewer Black and Hispanic students on campus will make it less attractive to those groups, prompting a cycle of further declines.</p><p>Marllury Vizcaino, a freshman from Washington Heights, in Manhattan, said she was the only Black student in her required first-year seminar last fall, and one of only two Black students in her chemistry class.</p><p>“I didn’t feel like I was welcome because I didn’t really see students who looked like me,” Ms. Vizcaino said, adding, “I can’t really talk about it without getting upset.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bryce Dawkins said that part of her attraction to Amherst was its population of Black students.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Bryce Dawkins, a senior from Oakland, Calif., majoring in English and Black studies, said that diversity attracted her to Amherst.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“When I was applying to college, I was looking at Amherst particularly because the number of Black students was so high,” she said.</p><p>During a book talk on campus in October, one of Amherst’s notable Black alumni, the professor and writer Anthony Abraham Jack, said he felt a deep sadness over the changes.</p><p>“I just can’t tell you how hard of a walk it was when the numbers came out,” said Dr. Jack, a 2007 graduate who teaches today at Boston University and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/10/magazine/college-inequality.html" title="">grew up</a> in a low-income household in Miami. “The place that changed my life and the place that I love, probably more than any other, is hurting.”</p><p>Concern about the numbers frequently comes up in faculty meetings and alumni gatherings; at the Charles Drew house, a dorm for Black students named for the pioneering Black physician; and at the Multicultural Resource Center, a gathering place for students of color.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The campus newspaper, The Amherst Student, described diversity as the <a href="https://amherststudent.com/article/acces-to-amherst-students-reflect-on-demographic-changes-in-largest-cohort-yet/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“ever-present backdrop”</a> during a visit by 130 prospective students last fall. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the Supreme Court’s decision on affirmative action, colleges can no longer consider applicants’ race.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Since its freshman class demographics were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/us/black-enrollment-affirmative-action-amherst-tufts-uva.html" title="">disclosed</a>, Amherst has been working to reverse the decline in Black and Hispanic students while still complying with the law. (When international students are included, this year’s freshman class was 9 percent Black, but that number declined from 19 percent last year.)</p><p>Colleges are no longer allowed to consider applicants’ race after the Supreme Court decision. So highly selective schools are seeking students who are the first to attend college in their family, visiting communities in rural areas and expanding financial aid for low-income students.</p><p>Amherst added four people to its recruitment team, who traveled a broad swath of the country to find students who might help the school yield a more diverse class. Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi were on the list. So was Texas’ Rio Grande Valley.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>On March 21, Amherst <a href="https://www.amherststudent.com/article/college-publishes-admissions-statistics-for-class-of-2029/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that it had offered admission to 1,175 students. Ninety-six are from rural regions, an increase from 37 last year. </p><p>Amherst said it did not have a racial breakdown for the newly admitted students, but Matthew L. McGann, Amherst’s dean of admission and financial aid, said that a quarter of the students would be the first in their family to attend college, a school record.</p><p>Dr. Elliott said he believed that more than one factor was at play in last year’s demographic shift, and pointed out that the school’s small size amplifies percentage changes.</p><p>And he is optimistic about the incoming class.</p><p>“We’re really encouraged by what we see so far,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Books that Bryce Dawkins, a Black studies major, is using for her thesis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Applicants must accept by May 1, and it is hard to say how many will say yes. Many schools, including those in the Ivy League, are competing for the best and brightest students from racial minority groups.</p><p>“The largest number of students who say ‘no’ to Amherst, end up in New Haven at Yale and other places like that,” Dr. McGann said in an interview. He acknowledged that there were also declines in the number of Black students offered admission last year, adding that one year is not enough to suggest a trend.</p><p>Dr. Jack said he believed that Amherst may have been more careful than many other schools in using measures, such as high school grades, to select its class.</p><p>“It felt like there was a conversation about trying not to get sued,” said Dr. Jack, a professor of higher education leadership. </p><p>Conservatives have only intensified their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/trump-pressure-universities.html" title="">scrutiny of schools</a> in recent weeks. The Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/california-universities-affirmative-action-doj.html" title="">announced</a> last month that it would investigate admissions policies at four California universities. And Edward Blum, an activist who is the driving force behind the lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court case, has said he is examining school data for evidence of “cheating.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Universities around the country are grappling with the demographic shifts caused by the landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Mr. Blum has said that his effort to end affirmative action is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/14/us/martin-luther-king-legacy-affirmative-action-reaj/index.html#:~:text=Blum%20told%20CNN%20he%20was,I%20Have%20a%20Dream%E2%80%9D%20speech." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inspired</a> by the work of Martin Luther King Jr., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/us/edward-blum-affirmative-action-race.html" title="">arguing</a> that “an individual’s race and ethnicity should not be used to help them or harm them in their life’s endeavors.”</p><p>In an interview, Jeffrey Wright, the Amherst alum and actor who starred in the 2023 film “American Fiction,” a satire on how the publishing industry stereotypes race, characterized Mr. Blum’s reference to Dr. King as “the most egregiously cynical thing that I’ve heard in a long time.”</p><p>Mr. Wright, who was recently on Amherst’s campus speaking at a literary event, sees Mr. Blum’s work as part of a movement to roll back civil rights, reminiscent of the Jim Crow era.</p><p>In recent months, Amherst leaders have held a flurry of meetings with campus constituencies, trying to reassure them that they are working to prevent resegregation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>After attending one such meeting with the Black Student Union, Zane Khiry, a senior from Avenel, N.J., and a former officer of the group, said he remained skeptical. </p><p>“They had a choice between prizing diversity and playing it safe.
