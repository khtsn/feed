On Friday, the economy recorded 0.1 percent growth from July to September, but it is forecast to contract over the entire year. And economists do not expect to see a return to growth in 2025, unless a new government can make significant changes quickly.</p><p>Driving that point home, Germany’s largest auto supplier, Bosch, said on Friday that it planned to cut 5,500 jobs, beginning in 2027. More than two-thirds will be at German factories.</p><p>High energy prices, a complex bureaucracy, aging public infrastructure and geopolitical developments have hurt Germany’s export industry. Political paralysis under the previous government exacerbated the situation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The three-party coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz spent the last year bickering over issues from energy to immigration before finally collapsing this month. Early elections on Feb. 23 are likely to result in a new government, which will have the opportunity to turn things around.</p><p>But economists warn that this will require changes to tax and welfare policies, as well as deregulation and investment in infrastructure. “Without major policy changes, the German economy’s long-run growth potential is extremely limited,” said Salomon Fiedler, an economist at Berenberg, a private bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstration outside a Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Many point to a lack of clear signals from Berlin on where they should direct investment.</p><p>An example was an abrupt decision by the government to end subsidies for electric vehicles at the end of last year, in an effort to slim down the budget. Automakers, which had been ramping up production of battery-powered cars, saw demand plunge after spooked customers pulled back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The fallout from that decision has led to enormous job cuts in the automotive industry this year. On Wednesday, Ford Motor announced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/business/ford-layoffs-europe.html" title="">it was eliminating 4,000 jobs in Europe</a>, most of them in Germany. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/volkswagen-plant-closures-germany.html" title="">Volkswagen</a> is threatening to close up to three of its 10 German factories as part of the restructuring needed to return the brand to profitability.</p><p>After losing natural gas from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Mr. Scholz’s government quickly pivoted to importing liquefied natural gas, which has kept homes warm and reserves full, but also has resulted in a 40 percent jump in prices from the year before. Nevertheless, the government went ahead with plans to shut down the country’s last nuclear reactor.</p><p>Analysts point out that such zigzag strategies make it difficult for business leaders to plan investments or predict costs. That frustration has translated into record levels of pessimism among Germany’s industrial leaders, according to a survey by the <a href="https://www.ifo.de/en/press-release/2024-11-20/german-industry-increasingly-pessimistic-about-its-own-competitive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ifo Institute in Munich</a>.</p><p>“There was no clear line from politicians and therefore great uncertainty,” said Stefan Sauer, an economic researcher who worked on the report. “That’s probably one of the main reasons the mood is so bad and why competitiveness is suffering as a result.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ford plant in Cologne, Germany.

The company has been struggling for years to decarbonize its steel production, as the price of powering its existing coking plants has soared.</p><p>Beyond the industrial giants, the German economy also depends on innovation and expertise. But in an increasingly digital world, Germany is lacking new start-ups that will help drive the next generation of growth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Government financing is available to help entrepreneurs start business, but when it comes time to scale them, many move to the United States, where venture funding is more widely available and taxes are lower.</p><p>“Our main problem is not what is happening to ThyssenKrupp,” Danyal Bayaz, the finance minister for the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg, told the German American Conference at Harvard last week. “It is why is the last successful German start-up 50 years old?”</p><h2 id="link-5ec60cea">The Looming Threat of Trump Tariffs</h2><p>Germany, the world’s third-largest exporting nation, sells cars, chemicals and machines around the world. But all three sectors are suffering, as geopolitics and supply chain shifts in recent years have disrupted global trade.</p><p>Last year, the United States replaced China as Germany’s most important trading partner, sending goods worth €157.9 billion, or $164.3, across the Atlantic. But with President-elect Donald J. Trump promising <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/trump-tariffs-china.html" title="">across-the-board</a> tariffs as a cornerstone of his economic policies — including levies of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/trump-enthusiasm-tariffs.html" title="">60 percent or more</a> on goods from China — that number could drop, further hurting Germany.</p><p>Many German companies are already heavily invested in the United States, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and dozens of automotive suppliers, as well as leading chemical and pharmaceutical firms. But those companies also export from their U.S. factories and could be hurt if Mr. Trump’s plans set off a wider trade war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In the last year, German companies invested €15.7 billion, or $16.3 billion, in the United States. Cheaper energy prices and lower taxes were the main attraction, but many companies also benefited from the incentives offered by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/climate/climate-policies-trump-would-reverse.html" title="">promised to repeal</a>.</p><p>During his first term in office, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/south-carolina-bmw-us-german-trade.html" title="">Mr. Trump repeatedly targeted Germany</a> for what he called its “massive trade deficit.” Germany’s trade surplus with the United States has not shrunk significantly over the last four years, reaching €63.3 billion in 2023, raising concerns that Mr. Trump could again make it an issue.</p><p>Regardless of how Mr. Trump’s economic policies play out, economists do not expect them to benefit Germany.</p><p>“Whether it’s the prospects of tariffs or U.S. tax cuts and deregulation indirectly undermining German competitiveness, it’s hard to see how U.S. economic policies will not be negative for the German economy,” said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING Bank.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy">More about Melissa Eddy</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
