Blinken, met in Jordan with King Abdullah II and called it “a time of promise but also peril for Syria and its neighbors” before flying to Turkey to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p><p>Mr. Blinken said it was essential for Syria’s new government, led by a Sunni Islamist group that the United States and others have called a terrorist organization, to respect basic principles of human rights, including the protection of minorities, and to ensure that Syria “is not used as a base for terrorism by groups like the Islamic State.”</p><p>He and Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, also delivered a message to Israel on Thursday, saying that its military presence in Syria, where it has taken control of a buffer zone along the Syrian-Israeli border, must be temporary. After the Assad government fell last weekend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/israel-demilitarized-zone-syria.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">Israel moved troops into the area</a> and has carried out hundreds of airstrikes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">against the regime’s military assets</a>, saying it worried that extremists could exploit the power vacuum and seize abandoned weapons to attack Israeli territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Israel is concerned that that vacuum could be filled by terrorists, by extremists, and so it moved forces into the buffer zone,” Mr. Blinken told reporters in Jordan. “It has told us and told others that that’s a temporary move, just to ensure, again, that this vacuum isn’t filled by something bad.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Antony J.

But he said that the United States had “every expectation” that Israel’s military presence there would not be permanent.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu said Israeli troops would remain in Syrian territory “temporarily,” but did not provide a definite timeline for them to withdraw.</p><p>“The collapse of the Syrian regime created a vacuum on Israel’s border and in the buffer zone,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The rebel alliance that toppled Mr. al-Assad — whose family ruled more than 50 years — was led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group once affiliated with Al Qaeda. The group’s leaders have said that they long ago abandoned the goal of global jihad and would work with all sects in Syria, but their agenda remains to be seen. Some analysts say the international community should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-terrorist-designation.html" title="">remove the terrorist label</a> from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to enable countries to send aid to Syria and to exert influence over the group.</p><p>Turkey on Thursday appeared to be the first country to send a high-level official to Syria since the rebels seized control of the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Families looking for information on detained relatives at the Al Mujtahid Hospital in Damascus, Syria, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ibrahim Kalin, the head of Turkey’s national intelligence agency, known by its acronym MIT, was seen in Syria’s capital, Damascus, in footage showed on Turkish television. Mr. Kalin was shown leaving the Umayyad Mosque with armed personnel around him while dozens of Syrians recorded videos.</p><p>It was the same mosque that the leader of the Syrian rebel offensive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/syria-hts-jolani.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">Ahmed al-Shara</a>, formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, visited on Sunday to commemorate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-damascus-rebels-assad-video.html" title="">the success of the rebellion</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Turkey’s intelligence agency did not immediately comment on Mr. Kalin’s visit to Damascus. But the trip came as Mr. Blinken indicated concerns about new offensives by Turkish forces and a Turkish-backed militia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/12/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#syria-isis-united-states-kurds" title="">against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria’s northeast</a>, calling it “really important at this time that we’re not sparking any additional conflicts.” Turkey calls the Kurdish force a terrorist group, tied to rebel Kurds in Turkey.</p><p>The Kurdish-led civil administration in Syria’s northeast said on Thursday that it had raised the Syrian independence flag above all government buildings, a largely symbolic move that it said affirmed “Syria’s unity and national identity” — apparently a signal to the new leaders in Damascus, who also have ties to Turkey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The control tower of the Aleppo Airport was riddled with bullet holes on Thursday after fighting over the previous week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For years, the de facto autonomous region and its military wing, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, have positioned themselves as an independent party in the Syrian civil war, unaligned with either the Assad regime or the opposition. In recent days, however, they have expressed a readiness to communicate with the new government in Damascus.</p><p>The chaos in Syria has given Israel a chance to severely weaken the military forces of a country that has long been a bitter enemy, without waiting to learn whether it will remain one. Israeli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/12/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-syria-buffer-zone-assad" title="">warplanes have conducted over 350 strikes across Syria</a> in recent days, targeting the remnants of the former government’s Navy, as well as chemical weapons, warplanes and long-range missile caches, according to the Israeli military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The Israeli military has also moved into a 155-square-mile zone on the Syrian-Israeli border that was intended to be a demilitarized area monitored by United Nations peacekeepers.

Video from the excursion — including of what were said to be deserted Syrian military fortifications — was later broadcast on several Israeli networks.</p><p>“It’s clear that we will remain here for quite some time,” Benny Kata, a local military commander, said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqODaV7KXSY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Israel’s public broadcaster. “We’re prepared for this.”</p><p>Any deal to restore the buffer zone appears distant, given the upheaval in Syria and Israelis’ concerns about the rebels who now lead the country. Mr. Netanyahu’s office said Israeli soldiers would remain in Syrian territory “until there is an effective force that will enforce” a 1974 cease-fire in the buffer zone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Israel’s allies have mostly stayed quiet on the capture of territory in the buffer zone and beyond, although France on Wednesday called for Israel to withdraw and respect Syria’s sovereignty.</p><p>In Damascus on Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/mazen-al-hamada-syria-activist-dead.html?smid=url-share" title="">a funeral attested</a> to the emotions loosed by the fall of the brutal Assad government.
