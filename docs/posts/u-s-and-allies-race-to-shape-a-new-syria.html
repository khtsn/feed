Blinken, met in Jordan with King Abdullah II and called it “a time of promise but also peril for Syria and its neighbors” before flying to Turkey to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p><p>Mr. Blinken said it was essential for Syria’s new government, led by a Sunni Islamist group that the United States and others have called a terrorist organization, to respect basic principles of human rights, including the protection of minorities, and to ensure that Syria “is not used as a base for terrorism by groups like the Islamic State.”</p><p>He and Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, also delivered a message to Israel on Thursday, saying that its military presence in Syria, where it has taken control of a buffer zone along the Syrian-Israeli border, must be temporary. After the Assad government fell last weekend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/israel-demilitarized-zone-syria.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">Israel moved troops into the area</a> and has carried out hundreds of airstrikes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">against the regime’s military assets</a>, saying it worried that extremists could exploit the power vacuum and seize abandoned weapons to attack Israeli territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Israel is concerned that that vacuum could be filled by terrorists, by extremists, and so it moved forces into the buffer zone,” Mr. Blinken told reporters in Jordan. “It has told us and told others that that’s a temporary move, just to ensure, again, that this vacuum isn’t filled by something bad.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Antony J.

But he said that the United States had “every expectation” that Israel’s military presence there would not be permanent.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu said Israeli troops would remain in Syrian territory “temporarily,” but did not provide a definite timeline for them to withdraw.</p><p>“The collapse of the Syrian regime created a vacuum on Israel’s border and in the buffer zone,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The rebel alliance that toppled Mr. al-Assad — whose family ruled more than 50 years — was led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group once affiliated with Al Qaeda.

Some analysts say the international community should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-terrorist-designation.html" title="">remove the terrorist label</a> from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to enable countries to send aid to Syria and to exert influence over the group.</p><p>Turkey on Thursday appeared to be the first country to send a high-level official to Syria since the rebels seized control of the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Families looking for information on detained relatives at the Al Mujtahid Hospital in Damascus, Syria, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ibrahim Kalin, the head of Turkey’s national intelligence agency, known by its acronym MIT, was seen in Syria’s capital, Damascus, in footage showed on Turkish television.

Israeli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/12/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-syria-buffer-zone-assad" title="">warplanes have conducted over 350 strikes across Syria</a> in recent days, targeting the remnants of the former government’s Navy, as well as chemical weapons, warplanes and long-range missile caches, according to the Israeli military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The Israeli military has also moved into a 155-square-mile zone on the Syrian-Israeli border that was intended to be a demilitarized area monitored by United Nations peacekeepers.
