He was 83.</p><p>His family said in a statement that his death, in a hospital, was caused by long Covid.</p><p>Mr. Mendes released more than 30 albums, won three Grammys and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2012 for best original song (as co-writer of “Real in Rio,” from the animated film “Rio”).</p><p>His career in America took flight in 1966 with Brasil ’66 and the single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRLd2V3m3kI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Mas Que Nada,”</a> written by the Brazilian singer-songwriter Jorge Ben. The Mendes sound was deceptively sophisticated rhythmically but gentle on the ears, suavely amplifying the original guitar-centered murmur of bossa nova with expansive keyboard-driven arrangements and cooing vocal lines that usually included Mr. Mendes himself chiming in alongside a front line of two female singers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Signed by Herb Alpert, Mr. Mendes’s group, Brasil ’66, scored a gold record with its first release on his label, A&amp;M Records.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">A&amp;M</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The group’s lilting, sensual pulse came to embody an adult contemporary cool in the 1960s that contrasted pointedly with the ascendant youth culture dominating the pop charts in the wake of the Beatles.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It was completely different from anything, and definitely completely different from rock ’n’ roll,” the Latin music scholar Leila Cobo observed in the 2020 HBO documentary “Sergio Mendes in the Key of Joy.” “But that speaks to how certain Sergio was of that sound. He didn’t try to imitate what was going on.”</p><p>After venturing to the United States for the first time in 1962 to perform at a bossa nova concert at Carnegie Hall on a bill with many of the music’s innovators — including his mentor, the composer Antonio Carlos Jobim — Mr. Mendes ultimately returned to Brazil, only to flee in 1964 in the wake of a violent military coup that witnessed his own brief arrest.</p><p>He then recorded and toured America with a new ensemble, Brasil ’65, but he was generating only tepid audience response when the other members of his band decided to head home to Brazil. Mr. Mendes stayed behind; he wanted to try one more time for American success.</p><p>His last gig with the group was in Chicago at a club called Mother Blues. In the HBO documentary, he recalled coming through the doors that night and seeing a young woman onstage playing the guitar and singing. “Wow, what an incredible voice,” he remembered thinking. “Very different.” He introduced himself to her, learned that her name was Lani Hall, and invited her to become the lead singer of his new group. “Well,” she said, “you’ll have to ask my father.” Ms. Hall was 19 at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>After securing her father’s reluctant permission, Ms. Hall flew with Mr. Mendes to Los Angeles and went to work. Mr. Mendes later brought in a second singer, the Brazilian-born Bibi Vogel. “When I heard the two girls singing together,” he said, “I thought, ‘Man, I really like this sound.’ The more we rehearsed, the more I thought, ‘This is so good!’”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil ’66 performing in 1970 on “The Engelbert Humperdinck Show” on ABC.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The group, newly named Brasil ’66, made its debut at a resort in the Bahamas — and was paid to stop playing by the management after patrons complained that they could not dance to their music.</p><p>A chastened Mr. Mendes brought the band back to Los Angeles. Almost immediately, he received an invitation to audition Brasil ’66 for the trumpeter Herb Alpert’s new record label, A&amp;M. Mr. Alpert signed them on the spot. The album that ensued, “Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil ’66,” quickly went gold on the strength of “Mas Que Nada” and other tracks that would become staples of the band’s repertoire, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS1RLT3BZJQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Going Out of My Head,”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmO8PbwZrXA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“One-Note Samba.”</a></p><p>In 2011, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.</p><p>“Their sound was captivating,” Mr. Alpert reflected in the documentary, “a hybrid of Brazilian music, a little bit of jazz, folk, African, blues. It had all of those elements. And then, to top it off, it had this fabulous singer, Lani Hall. I just fell in love with the sound. It was very, very, unusually special.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mendes and the singer Lani Hall of Brasil ’66 in a Los Angeles recording studio in 1967.

Diagnosed with <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/osteomyelitis#:~:text=Osteomyelitis%20is%20inflammation%20or%20swelling,can%20happen%20at%20any%20age." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">osteomyelitis</a>, an inflammation of bone tissue, when he was 3, he spent the next three years in a cast until his father was able to obtain the newly discovered “wonder drug,” penicillin, for him. Young Sergio became one of the first to take it in Brazil, and he was cured.</p><p>Still prohibited from physical recreation, he was given a piano and music lessons by his mother, which led to studies at the Conservatory of Music in Niterói, across Guanabara Bay from Rio de Janeiro. One afternoon in 1956, at a friend’s house, he heard the Dave Brubeck Quartet’s record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Take Five”</a> and was smitten with jazz.</p><p>He began playing with a local dance band at 17, and he continued to play jazz in every sort of venue around Niterói before finally venturing across the bay to Rio by ferry, to substitute for a friend at a new club, Bottles Bar, in the city’s infamous Flying Bottles Lane, a strip of tiny nightclubs in the Copacabana entertainment district that was known for its rough crowds but was also where some of the best bossa nova could be heard.</p><p>Audiences at a nearby club, Lojas Murray, sometimes took up collections to pay young Sergio’s ferry fare home. Soon he was hosting influential Sunday afternoon jam sessions at another Bottles Lane venue, the Little Club. This led to the formation of the Bossa Rio Sextet, a jazz unit that very quickly became popular across Brazil and recorded the album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0RoVIL5-eA&amp;list=PLQE6UVX1PE8U9zJtu8yRdG3LPZ19g_wXp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Você Ainda Não Iuviu Nada!”</a> (“You Haven’t Heard Anything Yet!”), released in 1962. With arrangements by Mr. Jobim and Mr. Mendes, it was one of the first albums to mix bossa nova with a jazz ensemble.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mendes, on piano, performed with his band the Bossa Rio Sextet at Carnegie Hall in 1962.

The next night, at Birdland, New York’s pre-eminent jazz club, Mr. Mendes met the celebrated alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, who invited him to stick around and not go right back to Brazil so that they could record together. The resulting album, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSeBbZx1m7I" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Cannonball’s Bossa Nova”</a> released in 1963 brought Mr. Mendes to the attention of Nesuhi Ertegun, vice president in charge of jazz at Atlantic Records, who signed Mr. Mendes to a contract and produced his first American release under his own name, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeWGLpztANc&amp;list=PL_72ShF5Ej8EXHMPbsU43tmJ5V69PKa0r" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Swinger From Rio,”</a> recorded in late 1964 and released in 1966.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The first American album under Mr. Mendes’s own name was released on the Atlantic label in 1966.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atlantic</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The subsequent signing of Brasil ’66 with A&amp;M left a contractual tangle that Mr. Ertegun equably resolved by retaining rights to Mr. Mendes’s instrumental records only. Of the dozen or so albums Mr. Mendes went on to make with Brasil ’66 for A&amp;M, from 1966 to 1972, nearly all went gold or platinum. The title track of the group’s biggest seller, their version of the Beatles’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFe0sc8XW94" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Fool on the Hill,”</a> released in 1968, sold four million copies as a single. Mr. Mendes later received a letter from Paul McCartney thanking him for his arrangement of the song.</p><p>That same year, an appearance on the Academy Awards broadcast performing Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s “The Look of Love” boosted Mr. Mendes and Brasil ’66 to international attention. Ms. Hall left the band in 1970, having fallen in love with Mr. Alpert, whom she would marry three years later.</p><p>Mr. Mendes continued to record, with and without his ensemble, for more than 50 years. He performed at the White House, toured with Frank Sinatra and, after a late-1970s lull, scored a Top 10 hit in 1983 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtcfEMf3NxU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Never Gonna Let You Go,”</a> a pop song written by Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann and sung on Mr. Mendes’s recording by Joe Pizzulo and Leeza Miller. He also reconnected with Lani Hall that year, acting as producer of her vocals on the title song for the James Bond film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwm1H0dxAKY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Never Say Never Again.”</a></p><p>Finding himself dismissed in the 1990s as a relic who had made “elevator music” in the 1960s, Mr. Mendes returned to his Brazilian roots with the 1992 album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlV59UbrY-E&amp;list=PL_72ShF5Ej8EIeSh0-JgqQJrQ0m2sPdwU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Brasileiro,”</a> which won a Grammy for best world music album. In the 21st century, he reignited his career once more through collaborations with a host of young artists, including the Black Eyed Peas, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, India.Arie, John Legend, Justin Timberlake, Q-Tip and Pharrell Williams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mendes performing in 2011.

All the time.”</p><p>Describing his music, Mr. Mendes once said: “The word is ‘joy.’ ‘Alegria.’ The next party. I’m ready.”</p><p>Bernard Mokam<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
