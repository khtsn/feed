He joined SpaceX as it was developing Starship, the largest and most powerful spacecraft ever constructed.</p><p>During Mr. Henry’s tenure at SpaceX, the company secured <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/1bd5d826c1e74a4abee083dde1652348/view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $102 million Air Force contract</a> to study how Starship could deliver military cargo to points around the world within 90 minutes.
