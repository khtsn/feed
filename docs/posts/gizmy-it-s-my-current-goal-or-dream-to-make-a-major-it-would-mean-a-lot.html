                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>Congratulations, Jack. You came in first place in a very tough group, beating BESTIA and now NIP. How does it feel?</strong></p>
                  <p>It feels good. As you said, it probably was the hardest group in the tournament just because of how the seeding was done. Pretty unfortunate. But yeah, very happy that we came through with the two wins. Feeling good.</p>
                  <p><strong>It wasn&#39;t looking good after Dust2, but you managed to come back with two convincing wins, especially the one on Nuke, one of NIP&#39;s strongest maps. Are you happy with the way the team responded?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah, for sure. I mean, we lost Dust2 in a way that we could move on from. We didn&#39;t get tactically outplayed or anything. To put it quite simply, we just lost too many entries. They aimed better than us. We just couldn&#39;t kill them. There were maybe one or two rounds where our endings were sloppy. But beyond that, there wasn&#39;t anything too big to worry about.</p>
                  <p>I said outside, &#39;Let&#39;s reset. We have a good prep for Nuke. We can win that, for sure.&#39; And we did. We came back firing and closed it out.</p>
                  <p><strong>You&#39;ve had a very strong start to the year. You beat NAVI in Bounty, you won Copenhagen Gaming Week Showdown. And yet, somehow it seems you&#39;re still flying under the radar. What has been the secret to this level of form?</strong></p>
                  <p>From an IGL perspective, it&#39;s just basically always pushing for quality gameplay. I study the game a lot, so I understand good reactions, good afterplant setups, ways in which we should take zones, stuff like this. And it takes time, but when you put this all onto the team, and they all understand and follow this belief of how to play, and you have quality, talented players doing that, then it becomes cohesive, and wins become a lot easier.</p>
                  <p>Of course, I&#39;m very happy with the players we have here. Everyone is understanding. Everyone listens to criticism very well. Everyone adapts to new setups, new meta changes.</p>
                  <p><strong>When ryu left for Astralis, it was expected that there would be a dip in the team&#39;s form, but that hasn&#39;t been the case, and Rainwaker has been playing really well. Did you expect him to adapt to the team so quickly and to be playing at this level right away?</strong></p>
                  <p>Somewhat, yes. I mean, rain is a really talented player anyway. He&#39;s been farming the tier-2 scene for a long time now, which is really good. And, I would say, kind of slotted in into anchor roles. Anchor/lurk roles are probably one of the easiest slots you can fit into in a team in terms of simplicity. For our team, at least.</p>
                  <p>And so I think things are quite simple for him to begin with. kakafu and I were very vocal in how we wanted him to play, how we wanted him to do things in certain situations. He&#39;s picked it all up greatly. Overall, it&#39;s not a big surprise that he has fit in seamlessly. It&#39;s good.</p>

                    <p>Rainwaker is averaging a 1.18 rating with Monte</p>
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>This victory was very important for your Major chances. You&#39;re now 18th in the world. What would it mean to reach the tournament with you leading the team?</strong></p>
                  <p>It&#39;s my current goal, or dream, I guess, to make a Major. It would mean a lot. We&#39;ve been working hard for the past year. Like, really, really hard. Especially for me, personally, because I&#39;m also doing university alongside it. Some grueling days. It would be very nice to make the Major. We&#39;re very confident. Of course, no jinxes. It would be great.</p>
                  <p><strong>Now that you&#39;ve survived such a tough group, how far do you think you can go here?</strong></p>
                  <p> Well, we take it game by game, so we&#39;ll see our opponent. I think we&#39;re playing fnatic tomorrow. It&#39;s a competent team. We have to take it game by game, see what we can do, come with a good understanding of how we want to play this game, what rounds we want to run. I have full confidence in the team for us to even win the event.</p>
