    <h1>We Are Running Out of Firefighters at a Perilous Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Earlier this month, the United States was on the verge of a nightmare scenario. Several Western wildfires were raging at once. In California, San Bernardino County was in a state of emergency; the nearby Bridge Fire had destroyed <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2024/9/8/bridge-fire/updates/0b9a5d9f-5ede-4b53-be5f-a0c9dad4fe86" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">54 structures</a>, stretching the state’s resources thin. Smoldering fires were reigniting across Washington and Oregon, and the Davis Fire <a href="https://dem.nv.gov/Resources/Davis_Fire/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bore down</a> on ski resorts near Reno, Nev., burning 14 structures. There <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR5OXYcMaJQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wasn’t a single elite operations unit</a> available — the kind you call in to manage major wildfires.</p><p>Cooler temperatures have brought some relief, but at any moment fire conditions might sweep back in, as they often do in California in September.</p><p>In the era of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/14/climate/wildfire-climate-change-urban-firestorm.html" title="">climate change and forest mismanagement</a>, it’s tempting to shrug one’s shoulders and presume that firefighter shortages are inevitable. But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p><p>Unlike urban firefighters, wildland firefighters are specially trained to take on the wildfires that plague the West. For years, those employed by the federal government have complained about profound levels of attrition driven by poor pay, increasingly exhausting working conditions and a lack of mental-health support. And unless Congress gets it together, a government shutdown on Oct. 1 will cut their wages across the board.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 2020, I was one of them, part of a crew in Northern California working to quell the August Complex, the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/mendocino/home/?cid=FSEPRD860382" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largest fire in California history</a>, and the North Complex, which <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-29/north-complex-fire-claims-16th-victim" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed</a> 16 people. My crewmates were the most courageous people I’ve ever known, unflappable in the face of danger, and the sense of service made it worth it.</p><p>But the physical and spiritual cost of this work was sobering. Firefighters typically work 16-hour shifts, but shifts can stretch to 30 hours or more. They do this every day for two to three weeks. They take two days off and start again. And this goes on for six months.</p><p>Right now firefighters are entering a period known as “Snaptember,” where exhaustion from the long days and trying conditions frays nerves. Where I lived and worked in California, we spent nights sleeping in apocalyptic fields of ash. We spent countless hours choking on smoke. Poison oak blistered our skin. The compensation for me, as an entry-level firefighter, was around $13.45 an hour. Unwilling to put my body through that for a second year, I quit. Of the 20 members of that crew, only five are left four years later.</p><p>When one of my crew members retired in 2022, he <a href="https://wildfiretoday.com/2022/04/14/experienced-wildland-firefighter-explains-why-he-resigned/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> a letter directed at the Forest Service, outlining its failures to support its firefighters. My former superintendent followed up with a letter describing, in dismay, a “mass exodus of our operational knowledge.”</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/wildland-firefighters" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">35 percent</a> of wildland firefighting jobs in California were vacant, according to ProPublica. When experienced firefighters flee, we lose decades of wisdom and expertise, putting the remaining firefighters and the public at greater risk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 2019, a <a href="https://www.grassrootswildlandfirefighters.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">group</a> of current and former wildland firefighters began calling for better pay, better mental and medical health services and better working conditions. Their work helped persuade the Biden administration in 2021 to temporarily raise the base pay of the federal firefighting work force to $15 an hour, as well as the pay for those who were more experienced.</p><p>That was a good start. But a temporary measure does little to keep tenured firefighters in the business.</p><p>Time and again, proposals to raise pay permanently and improve working conditions snake through Congress before eventually getting sidelined by other priorities. But in August, the House and Senate <a href="https://nffe.org/press-release/nffe-praises-house-and-senate-appropriators-for-approving-permanent-wildland-firefighter-pay-increase/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved budgets</a> that make President Biden’s temporary increase permanent. Now would be a good time for Congress to pass a federal spending bill so it becomes a reality.</p><p>But debate over a voter ID requirement attached to the spending bill threatens a government shutdown, which could mean the temporary pay bump would expire in the middle of fire season. Meanwhile, <a href="https://thehotshotwakeup.substack.com/p/after-finding-a-750m-budget-hole" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a rumored budget shortfall</a> has prompted the Forest Service to tell some Western regions that it must cut its seasonal firefighters by Oct. 1, leaving places like California with little outside support. And California may need extra resources soon: The <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/wind-mountain-valley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Santa Ana winds</a>, which usually kick up this month, will bear down from the Sierra Nevada mountains, likely spreading wildfires across Southern California.</p><p>So far, it has been an intense fire season, but not yet a record-breaking one. That should not relieve you; it should alarm you. If we face another record-breaking season soon — and we will — how will this broken system respond? It won’t.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In early September, 620 firefighters held the Davis Fire back from burning hundreds of homes near Reno, despite 60-mile-per-hour gusts. If the Santa Ana winds set Southern California ablaze in the coming weeks and we run out of crews and management teams, the Forest Service may have to decide whether to save lives in Reno or Los Angeles.</p><p>Before and since working as a firefighter, I have been a long-haul trucker, a journalist, a translator and a botanist. My job on the fireline was harder than the rest of those combined. My former crewmates in California are still chain-sawing and heaving arm- and face-fulls of poison oak away from advancing fires by the light of headlamps. They deserve long-term funding to build a robust mental health support system and at least $30 an hour, not $15.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>SR</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Want to Stop Wildfire Catastrophes?
