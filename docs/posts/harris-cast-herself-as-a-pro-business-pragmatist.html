    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In a closely watched speech on economic policy this afternoon in Pittsburgh, Kamala Harris promised “a new way forward” for the middle class, and portrayed Donald Trump as on the side of billionaires.</p><p>During the address, Harris wove together her vows to lower costs for the middle class and help small businesses into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/harris-economic-speech-pro-business.html" title="">a broader pitch for pragmatic economic leadership</a>. “We shouldn’t be constrained by ideology, and instead should seek practical solutions to problems,” Harris told the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, as her aides handed out a roughly 80-page policy paper on her economic plans.</p><p>Her speech, in which she said “I am a capitalist,” appeared designed to push back against Trump’s efforts to label her as a radical “communist.” It was also an attempt to appeal to the kind of moderate swing voter who have told pollsters that they trust Trump more on the economy.</p><p>Harris also attacked Trump’s economic plans, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/trump-taxes-tariffs-economy.html" title="">he outlined in a speech yesterday</a>. Trump’s pitch is to cut taxes on American businesses, while imposing high tariffs on foreign competitors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Israeli defense system intercepting missiles over northern Israel today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atef Safadi/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-47f10a3">The U.S. is trying to broker an Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire</h2><p>American diplomats are working to convince senior Israeli and Hezbollah officials to stand down before their rapidly escalating conflict turns into a wider regional war. U.S. officials hope that finding a way to step back from a war with Hezbollah could help put pressure on Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader, to agree to a deal that would end the fighting in Gaza and lead to the release of the remaining hostages. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/world/israel-gaza-hamas-hezbollah" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The diplomatic push comes amid signs that the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel is heating up. Hezbollah fired a missile today at Tel Aviv for the first time, and a top Israeli military leader told soldiers to prepare for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon. Israel continued its barrage of attacks, killing at least 51 people since this morning, the Lebanese health minister said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Filling sandbags in Clearwater, Fla., today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ricardo Arduengo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2de0f7d7">Helene becomes a hurricane as it heads toward Florida</h2><p>Helene was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/24/weather/tropical-storm-helene-hurricane" title="">upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane</a> this afternoon as it traveled on a path that forecasters expect will bring heavy rain to Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula and western Cuba.
