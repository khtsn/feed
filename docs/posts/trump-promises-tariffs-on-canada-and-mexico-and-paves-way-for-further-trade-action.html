Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Monday directing various agencies to study a wide variety of trade issues with an eye toward future tariffs, but he did not impose any new levies immediately, as he had previously threatened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still, the executive order could tee up a variety of significant trade actions in the months to come. The order directed Mr. Trump’s officials to deliver reports to him, mostly by April 1, assessing unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, U.S. technology controls and discriminatory foreign taxes.</p><p>It ordered U.S. officials to examine flows of migrants and drugs from Canada, China and Mexico to the United States, and the compliance of those three countries and others with their existing trade agreements with the United States.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
