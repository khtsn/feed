</span> yesterday. Things started on Karmine Corp&#39;s undefeated pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/482505/natus-vincere-vs-karmine-corp-champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1-playoffs-lr1/?game=215385&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Icebox</a>, where both sides continued using the no-duelist Omen compositions that brought them success in the past.</p>

<p>The beginning of Icebox was all Karmine Corp as they opened with a 7-1 lead. NAVI struggled to fend off the opposition&#39;s site hits and consistently dropped early picks, but managed to claw it back to 8-4 at the half off the back of heroics from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29867/hiro">
		hiro	</a>
</span>.</p>

 
<p><em>hiro wins a decisive 1v3 to bring NAVI up to four.</em></p>

<p>The second half mirrored the first, this time with Karmine Corp struggling to respond to NAVI&#39;s site hits as NAVI brought it back to par at 10-10. Chaotic rounds led to overtime, where Karmine Corp finally managed to close out the map 14-12 to continue their undefeated streak. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10307/marteen">
		marteen	</a>
</span> was a standout performer, racking up 26 kills and 163 ADR on Omen.</p>

<p>The second map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/482505/natus-vincere-vs-karmine-corp-champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1-playoffs-lr1/?game=215386&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>. NAVI easily took a 9-3 lead on their attack, with <span data-ref-id="7">

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/384/shao">

</span> shutting down any hopes of a retake, and hiro claiming yet another impactful 1v3 clutch in round 11. Karmine Corp mounted a comeback, winning six rounds in a row, but <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/18677/ruxic">
		Ruxic	</a>
</span> made a bold play in the final round, teleporting behind the opposition with his Omen ultimate and finding three. Both of NAVI&#39;s Controllers in Ruxic and Shao dominated with 26 kills apiece and 295 and 272 ACS respectively. </p>

 
<p><em>Ruxic emerges from the shadows where Karmine Corp least expects it.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/482505/natus-vincere-vs-karmine-corp-champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1-playoffs-lr1/?game=216537&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Ascent</a> was the decider. This was NAVI&#39;s first showing on the map after they stopped first-banning it in Week 4, and they chose a double-Sentinel composition featuring Yoru, Deadlock, and Tejo. On the other side, Karmine Corp adopted a standard Sova-KAY/O composition after a weak double-Duelist showing against FUT previously. </p>

<p>The first half was fairly close, with Karmine Corp winning multiple economic disadvantage rounds, but NAVI ended the first half with a 7-5 lead on their attack despite the defensive nature of their composition. It seemed like NAVI were in position to win the match easily after converting the bonus in the second half, spurring them to a 12-7 lead, but Karmine Corp clawed all the way back to 12-11 before falling at the final hurdle, and NAVI won the map 13-11. hiro toyed with his opponents throughout the map with his Cypher utility, ending with 23 kills to only 14 deaths.</p>

<p>With this win, NAVI survives elimination and will face the loser of <span data-ref-id="10">

</span> on Sunday. Karmine Corp are home early, demanding an elite performance from the French organization in Stage 2 if they still hope to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a>.</p>



<p>FUT and Vitality last met in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/429387/fut-esports-vs-team-vitality-champions-tour-2025-emea-kickoff-ubsf" target="_blank">upper bracket semifinal</a> of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2276/champions-tour-2025-emea-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> earlier this year. Since then, both teams have fallen a long way down in the standings, with the loser guaranteed to rank only in the top eight of the region after FUT placed fourth in Kickoff and Vitality placed fourth at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>.</p>

<p>FUT opened the series on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/482506/fut-esports-vs-team-vitality-champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1-playoffs-lr1/?game=216584&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Fracture</a>, a map Vitality hadn&#39;t played since Bangkok. The first half was back-and-forth; after a 4-1 start for FUT, Vitality brought it back to a 6-6 half with simple executes and sharp shooting. <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13258/cyvoph">
		CyvOph	</a>
</span> in particular found 14 kills, four of which were first kills, in the first half alone. </p>

<p>The second half, however, was all FUT. The Turkish squad won six rounds in a row on their attack, sprinting towards a 13-7 win. <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6510/atakaptan">
		AtaKaptan	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8369/yetujey">
		yetujey	</a>
</span> put up stellar numbers, the former ending with a KDA 17/9/8 and the latter with 18/11/6.  </p>

<p>The second map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/482506/fut-esports-vs-team-vitality-champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1-playoffs-lr1/?game=215389&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>, where Vitality switched to a double-Duelist composition with <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5022/derke">
		Derke	</a>
</span> on Raze and <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/312/sayf">
		Sayf	</a>
</span> on Yoru. FUT picked up right where they left off, easily shutting down Vitality with nine rounds in a row after dropping the pistol round. Vitality struggled to find success anywhere on the map, investing two timeouts and ending their round win drought only in round 12 to end the half 9-3 in FUT&#39;s favor.</p>

<p>Vitality prolonged the map slightly with a second pistol, but it was a futile effort and FUT closed out Split 13-6 in a statement win for them after a shaky showing versus FNATIC yesterday. They will face the losers of <span data-ref-id="18">
