</span> to determine who will challenge Shopify for the crown.</p>

<p>The two-map series played out on Abyss and Haven, Abyss being G2&#39;s pick and Haven being Shopify&#39;s pick. Shopify won Abyss 17-15 and Haven 14-12.</p>

<p>This matchup of juggernauts was a rematch of the upper final of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1750/game-changers-2023-championship-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">last year&#39;s Game Changers Championship</a>, where Shopify won 2-1. However, the tale of this matchup extends even further back to 2022, where G2 defeated <span data-ref-id="4">

<p>“Last year we finally got them,” meL said in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivG3vJciQ0s&amp;ab_channel=VALORANTChampionsTour" target="_blank">pre-match teaser</a>.  “This one&#39;s to settle the score.” </p>

<p>The series kicked off on G2&#39;s map pick of Abyss. While Shopify was last seen playing Vyse on the map in North America, this time they opted to mirror G2&#39;s more standard composition featuring Jett and KAY/O. </p>

<p>Shopify opened up an early 6-1 lead off of the back of unstoppable site hits, but a chaotic Sheriff thrifty win in round 8 and an outrageous no-scope Operator shot from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36175/rezq">
		rezq	</a>
</span> in round 9 brought G2 back into the game, narrowing the gap to a 7-5 lead in favor of Shopify at the half. </p>

 
<p><em>Crisp Sheriff shots give G2 a way back in (with some help from the environment).</em></p>

<p>The second half began with another Shopify pistol win as the North American squad extended their lead to 10-6. Once again, G2 fought back; a 1v3 from rezq in round 17 kept them in the map and a tense 1v1 from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20064/vania">
		Vania	</a>
</span> in round 24 brought it to overtime. Overtime was a string of constant attack round wins for both sides, but Shopify finally took the long-awaited defense round in the end to win Abyss 17-15. </p>

<p><span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17976/florescent">
		florescent	</a>
</span> topped the scoreboard with 33 kills, 10 of which were first kills, a 1.37 rating, and 189 ADR, while meL trailed close behind with 25 kills and a rating of 1.21.</p>

<p>The next map, Haven, featured another standard mirror matchup as both teams went for Neon-Breach compositions. G2 carried the first pistol to a 4-1 start on their defense, featuring a sharp <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/24149/amy">
		amy	</a>
</span> ace in round 5 to avoid a potential thrifty. Shopify answered back with a hard-fought B postplant in round 6 with G2, carrying the momentum to equalize at 4-4. The first half ended at 6-6 after a continued back-and-forth battle. </p>

 
<p><em><span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/24149/amy">
		amy	</a>
</span> stands tall on the C site and takes down Shopify on her own.</em></p>

<p>The two teams stayed neck-and-neck for the rest of the match. Every attempt at breaking away by either team was met with a swift answer; G2 winning the second pistol was countered by Shopify&#39;s early buy round wins to keep score tied at 8-8. G2 won a thrifty in round 18 with a 1v2 clutch from amy, but Shopify immediately won a thrifty of their own thanks to a 4K from <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17397/noia">
		Noia	</a>
</span>. </p>

<p>It seemed that G2 had finally found stable footing in round 22 when rezq aced with Neon&#39;s Overdrive ultimate to take her team up to 12-10. However, Shopify rallied with strong site holds to secure yet another overtime. This time, Shopify ended overtime quickly, demonstrating clean, coordinated plays to take Haven 14-12 and the series 2-0. </p>


<p><em>Experience and teamplay bring Shopify over the line.</em></p>

<p>Statistically, both Cypher players dominated the server. amy ended the map with an impressive 1.47 rating, 29 kills, and 186 ADR, while Noia followed with a 1.35 rating, 25 kills, and 157 ADR.</p>

<p>This victory sets Shopify up for an opportunity at winning back-to-back Game Changers championships as they reach the grand final without dropping a map. </p>

<p>“I think we just try our best to have fun,” <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/21486/sarahcat">
		sarahcat	</a>
</span> said regarding her team in the post-match interview. “The more fun you have, the easier it is to win, the less nervous you are.” </p>

<p>Shopify Rebellion will return in the grand final on Nov. 17 with a double map ban advantage. G2 Gozen will next play in the lower final on Nov. 16.</p>
