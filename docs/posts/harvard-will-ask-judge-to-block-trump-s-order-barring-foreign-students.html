It was unclear how many newly arriving graduate students are international.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump, in the same proclamation, also urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/06/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restricts-foreign-student-visas-at-harvard-university/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consider revoking current visas</a> for Harvard students, a move that would affect the school’s entire international enrollment.</p><p>An estimated 5,000 international students are currently enrolled at Harvard and another 2,000 recent graduates are in the United States on visas permitting students to remain temporarily after graduation to work.</p><p>The earlier ban attempts had been issued by the Department of Homeland Security and have been temporarily blocked by Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the Federal District Court in Boston, where Harvard has filed two lawsuits against the administration.</p><p>In a statement Wednesday night, Harvard vowed to protect its international students.</p><p>Kirsten Weld, president of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said the Trump administration’s order “wreaks havoc on the lives of thousands of young people.”</p><p>The school has become a focal point of the administration’s effort to conform higher education with Mr. Trump’s political agenda, one originally focused on antisemitism, but now broadened to attack diversity, equity and inclusion programs and transgender athletes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States,” Mr. Trump wrote in the proclamation, “because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers.”</p><p><em>This story is developing.
