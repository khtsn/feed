And she could not be more self-actualized about it.</p><p>The role required “wrestling with the flashes of my own insecurity and ego,” Moore explained. “I was being asked to share those things that I don’t necessarily want people to see.”</p><p>She was speaking in a video interview last week, dressed in casual black and big glasses, twisting and tucking her legs under her, on her office couch, with every thought. Filming through that discomfort was a “gift — silver lining, blessing, whatever you want to call it,” she continued. “Once you put it all out there, what else is there? There’s nothing to hide. Being able to let go was another layer of liberation for me.” The following night, she won <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26rGLetuNt8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Critics Choice prize</a> for best actress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Her career and cultural resurgence is overdue, said Ryan Murphy, the showrunner and a friend who at long last convinced her to work with him in last year’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/arts/television/feud-capote-vs-the-swans.html" title="">“Feud: Capote vs. The Swans</a>.” She had the beauty and aura of an old-school movie star, he said, with the professional discipline to match, but the flexibility of a seeker: “Game to do anything,” he said. “She’s a pathfinder. We all talk about what she’s done for the business and for other women.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/11demi-moore-01-qpkw/11demi-moore-01-qpkw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/11demi-moore-01-qpkw/11demi-moore-01-qpkw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/11/multimedia/11demi-moore-01-qpkw/11demi-moore-01-qpkw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A portrait of Demi Moore, with long black hair, wearing a gray sweater.

Whenever I have an emotional dilemma or I need advice, I do not go to my shrink — I go to her.”</p><p>With “The Substance,” Moore is the Oscars’ best actress front-runner too, for playing Elisabeth Sparkle, a onetime A-lister turned TV fitness instructor who is unscrupulously put out to pasture for the Hollywood sin of existing past 50. Her desperate solution is to inject herself with the mysterious concoction of the movie’s title, and birth — through a gaping wound in her spine — a more youthful self, named Sue (Margaret Qualley). They’re supposed to switch weekly, while the other vegetates. But in the battle for nubile flesh — and thus popularity — Elisabeth loses, grotesquely so.</p><p>“The Substance” is a bit of a genre-buster: Moore has described the project as a cross between Oscar Wilde’s classic, “The Picture of Dorian Gray”; the 1992 black comedy “Death Becomes Her”; and a Jane Fonda workout video. It’s vying for best picture as well, and the French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat was nominated for directing and for her script.</p><p>It’s mostly sparked conversation for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/movies/the-substance-coralie-fargeat.html" title="">none-too-subtle message</a>. But Moore’s singular performance — which also draws on her real-life past as a sex symbol whose form was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/movies/demi-moore-the-substance.html" title="">both worshiped and castigated</a> — is not just metaphor. It is enthrallingly physical, a feat of wordless emotional range: She has comparatively little dialogue; is hardly onscreen with a co-star (at least when both are conscious); and communicates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/movies/demi-moore-the-substance-clip.html" title="">mostly through tight shots</a>, often gazing at her own reflection — “which is really not the most comfortable place to be,” Moore said. “We look for what’s wrong.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In a scene from “The Substance,” Moore’s character Elisabeth vacuums while her other self (played by Margaret Qualley) peers over her shoulder from a billboard.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false"> Mubi</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The prosthetics that turn her into a wizened creature “were their own mixed bag of tricks,” she added, and “figuring out the logic and the rules, because it’s also a world that doesn’t exist.

I’m the writer, director, one of the editors, and one of the producers of “The Substance.” So we’re here with Elisabeth Sparkle, who is played by Demi Moore, who is the main character of the film. And she has to split the time with her alter ego, Sue, and she just wake up for what’s supposed to be a week. But the other self has taken a bit more time, and then it’s the moment where she realizes that something is wrong in the process. So this is the first transformation of Elisabeth, where she realized that her finger has dramatically aged. And what interested me into that aging was that it was not going to be totally realistic, but that it was going to be more as a deformation and some kind of metamorphosis. That kind of distorts her. And here the idea with all those close-ups that goes more and more macro on the fingers, is to project Elisabeth’s fears and Elisabeth’s thoughts about what’s happening to her. So now we enter a mental space where she projects all of her fear about what’s happening onto the shots. And so here she realized that it’s because the other self, Sue, played by Margaret Qualley, has taken more time and more fluid from her body that it has caused this degeneration. So here she’s calling the service the substance to try and find a way to revert this. And here we have the image of the billboard. That is the first time that the image of her other self is starting to dominate her. Look at her. And the other thing that starts to diminish her is that this voice doesn’t recognize her name. Elisabeth Sparkle, but it’s just when she says her number, “I’m 503,” that she gets an answer. So it’s the first time of almost dehumanization where she becomes smaller, weaker, and also the shot where I shot her from above, where I film her discomfort, the fact that she’s now threatened, and the point of view of the camera that is almost as a face off with her double and above her, as if she was tiny and kind of oppressed by the situation, makes her feel smaller into frame, while the other self kind of takes the lead. So here we see her anger and the fact that she tries to cope with her stress and her anger by just cleaning the apartment, trying to cope with the situation. And again, there is this billboard that is everywhere. There is no way to escape from her. And here again, through the object, through the vacuum cleaner, we see that Elisabeth’s attention has spotted something disturbing. And here we hear the music. The music that is from Sue’s world. The “Pump It Up,” that starts to overwhelm her. And again, she starts to feel smaller and smaller into frame. Meanwhile, Sue becomes bigger and bigger with this hypersexualized body that becomes as a giant, as a giant image that kind of tyrannize you. And that kind of makes you feel so small and so ugly compared to all this flesh, to all this perfection that becomes as an injunction that becomes higher and higher.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/substance-anatomy1-fmzc/substance-anatomy1-fmzc-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The writer and director Coralie Fargeat narrates a sequence from her film starring Demi Moore.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mubi</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In an email, Qualley gushed about her co-star. “Demi is the magic blend of deep consideration and the ability to courageously live in the present,” she said. She learned something every day; their collaboration was “one of the great gifts of my life,” Qualley added.</p><p>The production, which stretched over five-and-a-half months in France, was also among the most strenuous of Moore’s 40-year-career, she said. “G.I. Jane,” the 1997 Ridley Scott action drama in which she buffed up to play a Navy S.E.A.L.-esque recruit, “was physically very challenging,” Moore said, “but it was very straightforward. This was emotionally and physically draining every day — <em>every day</em>. Even the simplest scenes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>And yet it was the leap she sought, after stepping back from acting intermittently over the years: first, soon after her ’90s heyday, to raise the three daughters she shares with Bruce Willis, her ex-husband; and then to take stock of herself.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>One thing that emerged from this period, alongside a renewed focus on sobriety, was her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/books/demi-moore-memoir-inside-out.html" title="">unflinching, best-selling 2019 memoir,</a> “Inside Out.” In it, among many other traumas, she details the disordered eating and overexercising she engaged in for years — she once put a lock on her refrigerator — and how she emerged with a far less fractured sense of self.</p><p>The “Substance” role was not handed to Moore; Fargeat considered other actresses and it took a half-dozen meetings between the two to finalize the casting. In one of those encounters, Moore shared a copy of her book (written with Ariel Levy, of The New Yorker). It was a plain-on-the-page vehicle, Moore said, to show how much Fargeat’s story resonated with her — and, she added, “not from a place of the wound, but from the place that actually had healing.”</p><p>Moore was not interested in litigating blame. “Look, women being marginalized at a certain age, particularly in the entertainment industry, is the least-new information of the entire movie,” she said.</p><p>Neither was she only highlighting what she called “that painful state that I think we’ve all experienced, because we’re human, which is of compare and despair.” What drew her to the screenplay was the way those impulses were turned inward, violently. “Because I can look and say there is nothing that anyone else has done to me, that is worse than what I have done to myself.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>There were vast gulfs between her and the lonesome, career-obsessed Elisabeth, she said. But, she added: “Emotionally, it wasn’t that big of a reach. I really did understand her.”</p><p>Moore escaped — or persevered through — a turbulent, peripatetic childhood, striking out on her own at 16. She was a soap opera regular by 19, then made her name on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/movies/brat-pack-documentary-takeaways.html" title="">the Brat Pack movies</a> like “St. Elmo’s Fire,” and became a superstar with a string of ’90s hits including “Ghost,” “A Few Good Men” and “Indecent Proposal.” Earning a $12.5 million paycheck for “Striptease,” in 1996, made her the highest-paid actress in the world, but did not engender good will. (She acquired the sneering nickname “Gimme Moore.” Willis, who then made even bigger bank as an action hero, got no such derision.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Moore with Pilaf, the one-pound micro Chihuahua that’s the favorite of her six dogs.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Another flashpoint came with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BM7eAM8g4UX/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=1a2d75eb-dddb-4039-b116-fd3b34297be6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her 1991 Vanity Fair cover,</a> photographed by Annie Leibovitz. Moore was seven months pregnant with her second daughter and Leibovitz snapped a shot of her, bejeweled and naked, ostensibly as an end-of-day family photo. Long before celebrities gleefully bared their bumps, Moore’s elegant flaunt remains one of her proudest achievements, she said in her memoir. “It helped move the needle culturally, whether I intended it to or not,” Moore wrote. “To help women love themselves and their natural shapes, that’s a remarkable and gratifying thing to have accomplished, particularly for someone like me who spent years doing battle with her body.”</p><p>The idea that she bared her skin — in movies or elsewhere — out of confidence was a long-held public misperception, she told me. “I was so uncomfortable. I was trying to just find ways of overcoming it.” </p><p>These days, Moore is trying to absorb the critical and industry adulation for “The Substance,” without weighing it too heavily. “Whatever happens, I just keep focusing on remembering not to make it mean too much, but also not to make it mean too little,” she said. “But I can enjoy all of it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>She seemed to turbocharge her Oscar campaign with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/movies/demi-moore-the-substance-oscar-nomination.html" title="">her win at the Golden Globes</a> last month. (She had been nominated before, but never won.) In her stunned speech, she mentioned a producer who negated her as “a popcorn actress,” and also repeated some wisdom from a woman she met decades ago, who told her blankly that she would never be good enough — “but you could know the value of your worth, if you put down the measuring stick.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“It just hit me so deeply,&#34; Moore said to me, as she nuzzled her one-pound micro Chihuahua, <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/demi-moore-dogue-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pilaf</a><strong>, </strong>the most favored of her six mini dogs. (Don’t fret: “They all have it pretty good.” They all sleep in her bed; they travel; a timid dachshund was on his way to meet with a trainer, for a confidence boost. “Literally everything is built around these silly dogs.”)</p><p>The Globes also introduced a factoid about Moore, that she is “an avid doll collector,” with a separate residence “for her 2,000+ vintage dolls.” In her book, she says she started amassing toys when her children were young, to make up for what she missed in her own childhood. Her assemblage extends beyond just figurines — she has miniatures and oversize pieces, quilts and oddities. “I am a curiosity collector,” she said.</p><p>Imperfections, she has learned, are worth noticing.</p><p>“Not that I like being scared and vulnerable,” she said, “but I know it’s a rich place to be.
