The red letters beside her portrait cried out with an urgency that never dimmed for a quarter century.</p><p>“Please help me find Song Hye-hee!”</p><p>After she vanished on a winter night in 1999, her father, Song Gil-yong, made looking for her his life’s work. As he traveled the country putting up banners and replacing ones that had faded in the sun and rain, his face became deeply creased and tanned.</p><p>The banners, each roughly the length of a car, stretched across sidewalks as office workers hurried past. After dark, they caught the glow of streetlights and neon signs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“He was always hopeful that she was out there somewhere,” said Na Joo-bong, 67, the chairman of a national organization for missing children in South Korea and one of Mr. Song’s closest confidants. “He had one wish: to hold her hand one day.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00xp-father-handout-flhb/00xp-father-handout-flhb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00xp-father-handout-flhb/00xp-father-handout-flhb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00xp-father-handout-flhb/00xp-father-handout-flhb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man in a blue jacket looks at photos of women hanging on a wall." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00xp-father-handout-flhb/00xp-father-handout-flhb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00xp-father-handout-flhb/00xp-father-handout-flhb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00xp-father-handout-flhb/00xp-father-handout-flhb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00xp-father-handout-flhb/00xp-father-handout-flhb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1929w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d07083ee-ef9e-52b3-89c6-164da089aef2" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Song Gil-yong in his apartment in 2013, looking at pictures of his wife and his missing daughter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Na Joo-bong</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The banners made Mr. Song a symbol of parental devotion in his country. But he paid enormous personal costs. His wife took her own life. His relationship with his eldest daughter splintered. His savings dwindled with each new banner he bought and each mile he drove in his small white truck.</p><p>This summer, lying gaunt and exhausted on a hospital bed, he wondered if he would ever see Hye-hee again.</p><p>Song Hye-hee, a sophomore at Songtan Girls’ High School in Pyeongtaek, a city south of Seoul, had dinner with friends and boarded a bus home on Feb. 13, 1999. She never arrived.</p><p>The bus driver told Mr. Song, then 45, that she had gotten off at the last stop, just over a mile from home, along with a man in his 30s who smelled like alcohol. The family home was in a poorly lit part of town with unpaved roads.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The police classified Hye-hee as a runaway because South Korean law only considered children missing if they were under 8. That threshold would later be raised. But the initial police response forced Mr. Song and his wife to look for her on their own.</p><p>Days after she went missing, Mr. Song pleaded for help and the police began investigating Hye-hee’s case as a potential kidnapping. But they found no trace of her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bus stop in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, near a place where Hye-hee was last seen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The search became the singular focus of her parents’ lives. They sold their dog-breeding business and emptied their savings to buy banners and fliers. As they traveled the country hanging banners on roadside trees and utility poles, they subsisted on soju, cigarettes and instant ramen noodles.</p><p>Mr. Song’s wife helped him hand out fliers until her fingers were raw, he said in television interviews. Together, they would retrieve fliers from bathroom trash bins and hand them out again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I’ve never spent a day without thinking about Hye-hee,” he told a television interviewer in 2013. “I don’t think anybody can live comfortably after losing a child.”</p><p>The emotional weight of the search proved too much for Mr. Song’s wife, who Mr. Song said was an orphan. She died by suicide a few years after their daughter disappeared, he said. He found his wife lying on the floor, hugging a pile of fliers with photographs of Hye-hee.</p><p>His wife’s death prompted him to try taking his own life several times until his eldest daughter, Eun-ju, convinced him not to.</p><p>“She said she’d also become an orphan if I died,” he said in a television interview.</p><p>When he resumed his campaign, he worked alone. He usually left his state-subsidized studio apartment in his truck at dawn and returned after sundown. On some days, he took ferries to remote islands off South Korea’s coastline, where he handed out fliers on the off chance that Hye-hee might be living there.</p><p>Mr. Song funded his daily essentials and his campaign with the income he earned from working on construction sites and selling cardboard waste. He turned impatient as his body weakened and his family grew uncomfortable with the publicity he received.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“He wondered how much longer he could continue doing what he did,” said Ma Myong-nak, 59, who ran a sign factory in Pyeongtaek and printed more than a thousand banners for Mr. Song over the past decade.</p><p>But he couldn’t imagine doing anything else.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Song family home in Pyeongtaek is now abandoned.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In his Pyeongtaek apartment, Mr. Song taped pictures of Hye-hee and his wife on the wall near his pillow. He couldn’t fall asleep without seeing their faces, Mr. Na said.</p><p>“He felt sick if he didn’t go out looking for her,” said Choi Jong-hyun, 43, the manager of a highway rest stop west of Pyeongtaek where Mr. Song often handed out fliers to travelers. “His sense of guilt was so great that he couldn’t lead a normal life.”</p><p>Mr. Song’s hopes were raised over the years by strangers who reached him by the phone number printed on his banners, saying they knew where his daughter was.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In 2012, he was with a <a href="https://youtu.be/xQ7GJbCbVDA?t=272" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">television producer</a> in his apartment when he received a text message from a man who claimed to have seen Hye-hee in a nearby town. Mr. Song ran outside, jumped into his truck and started driving.</p><p>He burst into the police station where the caller had agreed to meet. But the man’s description of the woman he had seen did not match a computer-generated image of 30-year-old Hye-hee. Mr. Song wept on the drive home.</p><p>The statute of limitations for prosecuting suspects in Hye-hee’s case expired in 2014, and the physical demands of the search were catching up with Mr. Song. He fell several times from a ladder he climbed to hang up the banners, suffering a herniated disk and a severe brain injury.</p><p>But the search continued.</p><p>At a Presbyterian church he attended in his neighborhood, people described him as socially withdrawn. He would stay for lunch after Sunday services before spending the rest of the day hanging banners. “He had a broken heart,” said Lee Jae-il, a member of the congregation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Na Joo-bong, the chairman of a national organization for missing children in South Korea, said he had promised to continue looking for Mr. Song’s missing daughter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Song’s quest alienated his elder daughter, who struggled with the constant public attention and her in-laws’ gossip, Mr. Na said. In 2018, she scrapped his truck, which she had lent him, hoping to end what she saw as a self-destructive obsession, Mr. Na said. She did not respond to a request for an interview.</p><p>Mr. Song purchased another truck with money he received from an anonymous donor. But another blow came in 2022, when his teenage granddaughter, Eun-ju’s eldest child, died by suicide, Mr. Na said.</p><p>“If my first daughter dies, too, I’ll have nothing left,” Mr. Na recalled him saying.</p><p>Mr. Song was starting to question in earnest whether Hye-hee was still alive, and grieving his shattered relationship with Eun-ju, Mr. Na said. Even then, his friends, afraid of hurting him, found it difficult to broach the idea of ending his search.</p><p>“It’s not easy to give up something you’ve been doing for 25 years,” said Kim Rye-yeong, 39, who befriended him in his final years. “Looking for his daughter gave him the strength to live on.”</p><p>By his own count, Mr. Song had driven about half a million miles, distributed three million leaflets and hung 2,500 banners by 2017.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“I feel happiest when I’m hanging banners and passing out fliers,” he said in a 2020 newspaper interview. “I don’t care if this seems like an obsession.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The village where the Songs lived before Hye-hee went missing in 1999. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Woohae Cho for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Eventually his strength gave out. In August, Mr. Song was hospitalized with Covid-19 and heart disease.</p><p>Days later, at around noon on Aug. 26, he was driving in Pyeongtaek when he suffered a heart attack and his truck crossed the centerline, colliding with an oncoming vehicle. Mr. Song was pronounced dead in a hospital, according to Kim Byung-sik, a local police inspector. He was 71.</p><p>Since then, the banners that once dotted the country’s landscape have largely disappeared. But Mr. Na, who promised Mr. Song that he would continue looking for Hye-hee, said he planned to put up the ones he left behind.</p><p><em>If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 in the United States to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or visit </em><a href="http://speakingofsuicide.com/resources" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources</em></a><em> for a list of additional resources.
