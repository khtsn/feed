    <h1>NYT v. Sullivan: Will the Landmark Defamation Ruling Survive?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In any given year, the United States Supreme Court hears only 80 or so cases. That means that — in a nation with more than 1.3 million attorneys — the group of lawyers who get to argue before the nine justices is an exclusive club. For years, it was Roy Katriel’s dream to gain access to that club. He would regularly trawl through the dockets of the country’s 13 federal appeals courts, looking for cases to latch onto that seemed ripe for Supreme Court review.</p><p>Katriel, who grew up in Venezuela but moved to Miami in 1983, had the immigrant’s zeal to succeed in his adopted homeland. After graduating from college at 18 and briefly pursuing a career in engineering, he became a lawyer. By 2004, he was running his own little law firm, its offices down the road from the beach in a San Diego suburb.</p><p>Until 2020, the closest Katriel had come to the Supreme Court was having written a so-called petition for a writ of certiorari, asking the justices to hear a case involving the federal rules of evidence. The court rejected his request, but Kannon Shanmugam, one of the country’s leading Supreme Court litigators, emailed Katriel to congratulate him on a petition that was “exceptionally well done.” That small act of kindness inspired Katriel to hunt for his next opportunity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>One day late in 2020, Katriel came across a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. It involved a $60 million lawsuit that Shkelzen Berisha, the son of Albania’s former strongman, filed in 2017 against Guy Lawson, a journalist in New York. Berisha accused Lawson and his publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, among others, of having defamed him in a book called “Arms and the Dudes” that linked Berisha to organized crime and illicit ammunition sales. (He denies any such ties.) A federal judge dismissed Berisha’s lawsuit, finding that Lawson’s reporting, even if it turned out to be inaccurate, was protected under the First Amendment. In September 2020, a three-judge appeals panel upheld the lower court’s ruling.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>When Katriel first read the 11th Circuit’s decision, it seemed open-and-shut. Starting in 1964 with its landmark decision in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court had made it hard for those in the public eye to win defamation cases. To prevail, they had to prove that the defendant knew that what they were publishing was false or had acted with reckless disregard as to its accuracy — a standard that has come to be known as “actual malice.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/magazine/09mag-sullivan/09mag-sullivan-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/magazine/09mag-sullivan/09mag-sullivan-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/magazine/09mag-sullivan/09mag-sullivan-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Roy Katriel at a desk." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/magazine/09mag-sullivan/09mag-sullivan-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/magazine/09mag-sullivan/09mag-sullivan-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/magazine/09mag-sullivan/09mag-sullivan-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/magazine/09mag-sullivan/09mag-sullivan-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a909f893-7f35-5c4f-bb07-5335bd8a7ccb" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Roy Katriel in his California office in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Casarez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The court’s theory was that a vigorous, probing press was an essential safeguard of democracy, a key to holding the government and other institutions in check. If a public figure could seek debilitating damages every time a news organization made a mistake, the media would either start to censor itself or be sued into oblivion. Both scenarios ran counter to the First Amendment’s guarantee of a free press — and the core American belief in the value of unfettered speech.</p><p>Yet in the years since Donald Trump was first elected president, railing against “fake news” and “crooked” journalists, the Sullivan decision and its actual-malice standard had entered the cross hairs of the conservative legal movement. Quietly at first, a small group of right-wing lawyers, judges and activists set out to water down or abolish this decades-old precedent, which they viewed as unfairly protecting the mainstream media that many on the right loathed. Over the years, Trump and allies like Sarah Palin, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz and the casino mogul Steve Wynn — in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-829/341639/20250131173910823_24-%20Petition.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a petition</a> to the Supreme Court this year — cajoled the courts to overturn Sullivan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>By the time Berisha’s appeal was rejected in 2020, this campaign was already gaining momentum, thanks in part to support from officials at a network of conservative groups like the Federalist Society, the Claremont Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Weakening Sullivan was a way to weaken the media. A year earlier, the mission picked up the crucial public support of Justice Clarence Thomas, who said in his 1991 confirmation hearings that he had “no agenda” to overturn Sullivan but now argued that it was not grounded in the original meaning of the First Amendment.</p><p>Katriel was a constitutional originalist, like Thomas, and the justice’s critique of Sullivan resonated with him. Now, as Katriel perused the court filings associated with Berisha’s lawsuit, it dawned on him that perhaps he could use this case to invite the Supreme Court to do what Thomas wanted: reconsider aspects of Sullivan.</p><p>Katriel emailed one of Berisha’s lawyers, Jason Zoladz, in December 2020 and offered to draft a petition for a writ of certiorari requesting that the Supreme Court hear an appeal. The goal was “to have the United States Supreme Court review whether the ‘actual malice’ standard for defamation cases involving public figures should be reexamined,” he wrote.</p><p>Zoladz discussed the matter with Berisha, and the lawyer replied to Katriel that he was “interested in exploring your assistance.” In February 2021, Katriel filed his <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1063/167810/20210201150758875_40588%20pdf%20Katriel%20br-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">petition</a>. “The question presented is whether this Court should overrule the ‘actual malice’ requirement it imposed on public figure defamation plaintiffs,” it began.</p><p>Back when Berisha filed his lawsuit, Simon &amp; Schuster had enlisted Elizabeth McNamara, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine, a leading law firm representing publishers and media companies, to defend itself and Lawson. McNamara was surprised to hear that Berisha was appealing to the Supreme Court, with the help of a new lawyer. She and her colleagues had never heard of Katriel. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1063/179383/20210517133732949_20-1063%20-%20brief%20in%20opp%20for%20e-filing%205-17-2021.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Her reply</a> to his petition was disdainful. Berisha’s goal, she wrote, was simple: “to make it harder to criticize powerful individuals.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Now it was up to the justices to decide how to handle the case. Katriel, McNamara and their clients wouldn’t have to wait long to learn their fates. With the help of a Trump-appointed judge and a flawed research paper in an academic journal, the outcome would have potentially grave consequences for the First Amendment and the freedom of the press.</p><p><strong>One of the defining </strong>traits of the modern American media is the ability of journalists — whether they work for major national outlets or obscure blogs — to investigate government officials, billionaires, corporate executives, university presidents, religious leaders, celebrities and the like, undaunted by the fear of retaliatory litigation. This is not the case everywhere. In democracies like Britain, public figures have generous legal grounds to sue news outlets for negative coverage and can even seek injunctions to prevent articles from being published, a climate that can make hard-nosed investigative journalism financially risky if not unpalatable. The freedom of American journalists to dig into and expose the secrets of the powerful may be unmatched anywhere in the world.</p><p>This state of affairs can be traced, in large part, to a full-page ad that appeared in The New York Times on March 29, 1960. The tale has been expertly told by Anthony Lewis in his book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/100843/make-no-law-by-anthony-lewis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Make No Law”</a> and, more recently, by Samantha Barbas in <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/actual-malice/hardcover" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Actual Malice.”</a> The civil rights movement was in full swing, and across the South, government officials were doing everything in their power to preserve white supremacy. The ad was a fund-raising appeal to support the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and to bankroll a voter-registration drive in the South. It ran under the headline <a href="https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/documented-rights/exhibit/section4/detail/heed-rising-voices.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Heed Their Rising Voices,”</a> and it criticized unnamed “Southern violators of the Constitution” for their efforts to destroy King. Above a long list of civil rights activists, celebrities and political and religious leaders who endorsed its message, the ad cataloged the ways in which Southern officials had “answered Dr. King’s peaceful protests with intimidation and violence.”</p><p>The gist of the ad was true: Southern authorities were engaged in brutal repression that many observers likened to the tactics of dictators such as Stalin. But some of the details in the ad were exaggerated or wrong. For example, it falsely stated that students protesting at Alabama State College had been padlocked inside a dining hall “in an attempt to starve them into submission.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The 1960 advertisement at the center of New York Times v. Sullivan.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Times was a national newspaper, with a circulation of about 650,000, but its readership in the South was minuscule. On the day the ad ran in 1960, a grand total of 394 copies went to subscribers, libraries and newsstands in Alabama. Yet local journalists there spotted the ad, and a couple of the state’s newspapers published articles about it, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience — including L.B. Sullivan, a city commissioner in Montgomery. His responsibilities included overseeing Montgomery’s police force, whose behavior the “Heed Their Rising Voices” ad had condemned. On April 8, he sent an angry letter to The Times stating that the ad, which had not named him, nonetheless amounted to a personal accusation of “grave misconduct.” He demanded a retraction.</p><p>Less than two weeks later, when no retraction was forthcoming, Sullivan filed a lawsuit in a local court accusing The Times and some of the ad’s signatories of libel. He sought damages of $500,000. At the time, it was relatively easy for plaintiffs, regardless of their public stature, to prevail in such cases. Unlike in a criminal trial, in which the defendant is presumed innocent, the starting point in libel cases, based on centuries of “common law” originating in England, tended to be that what the defendant wrote was false. It was up to him to prove otherwise. A result was that “publishing criticism — even truthful criticism — of public officials was a dangerous undertaking for a newspaper,” as Barbas <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/the-enduring-significance-of-new-york-times-v-sullivan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put it</a>.</p><p>In the weeks after Sullivan filed his lawsuit, other Alabama officials — none of them named in the ad — followed his lead, seeking a total of roughly $3 million in damages from The Times. Such penalties posed an existential threat to the barely profitable newspaper. Sullivan and his colleagues were not trying to hold The Times accountable for minor inaccuracies. They were seeking to send a message to it and other influential news organizations: If they aggressively covered the civil rights struggle, documenting the illegal and at times violent ways that white Southerners were fighting to maintain power, they would incur catastrophic costs.</p><p>Why did Sullivan and his colleagues care what papers like The Times, with its paltry Southern readership, wrote about them? Because civil rights leaders had been relying on the national media to provoke outrage among the broader public about Southern racism, and this unwanted attention was causing trouble. More protesters were arriving from Northern cities. And through legislation and law enforcement, the federal government was taking a more muscular approach to protecting civil rights. More news coverage meant more meddling.</p><p>Sullivan was an unapologetic bigot. He campaigned for his commissionership on a hard-line anti-integration platform, and he railed against the influence of outside “agitators,” whether they were student protesters or carpetbagging Northern reporters. On more than one occasion, when mobs of Klansmen and other angry whites attacked demonstrators, Sullivan instructed the police not to intervene until the victims were sufficiently bloodied. “Providing police protection for agitators is not our policy,” he explained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>What <em>was</em> part of the policy — for Sullivan and his peers across the South — was trying to delegitimize the media as lying propagandists who were seeking to indoctrinate and brainwash gullible readers. The Times, with its unparalleled influence and small army of reporters, was demonized as the worst of the worst. At least in the South, these anti-media tactics worked. Out-of-state journalists were routinely assaulted. The libel lawsuit became just another weapon in the same arsenal.</p><p>Sullivan’s case went to trial in the Montgomery courtroom of Judge Walter Jones, who maintained segregated seating, was a devout promoter of all things Confederate and believed in what he called “white man’s justice.” (The 72-year-old judge was also apparently a pedophile. He had been arrested on charges of molesting a boy in a local Y.M.C.A., and his study was reportedly adorned with photos of nude boys.) As the Sullivan trial was about to get underway, some prospective jurors showed up to court in Confederate uniforms, toting pistols. Jones instructed the jury to assume that Sullivan had been injured by the ad. It took the jurors barely two hours to return a verdict against The Times. The newspaper was ordered to pay Sullivan $500,000. It was the largest libel judgment in the state’s history.</p><p>For racist Southerners, this was the equivalent of an invitation. The courts could be used to scare the press into silent submission. Over the next few years, Southern officials would bring libel suits against the media seeking damages totaling nearly $300 million (roughly $3 billion today). The Times, fearing a tidal wave of litigation, barred its reporters from setting foot in Alabama, and its lawyers urged staff members not to write articles about the state’s racism. The newspaper appealed the verdict, but nobody was surprised when Alabama’s highest court affirmed the decision. That left one last hope: the U.S. Supreme Court. But this seemed like a long shot. The Constitution guaranteed people the right to freely express themselves, but there were limits. You couldn’t shout “fire” in a crowded theater, for example. Libelous speech was another exception. The Supreme Court did not regard it as protected by the First Amendment, and states were therefore free to come up with their own standards governing what constituted defamation and when people could collect damages.</p><p>Long before L.B. Sullivan came along, such disparities had left an opening for litigious and deep-pocketed plaintiffs to use state libel laws to muzzle — or bankrupt — their critics. In one notorious case, the industrialist Henry Ford sought an astronomical $1 million in damages from The Chicago Tribune for an editorial that called him an ignorant anarchist. The case dragged on for three years before a Michigan jury awarded Ford <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/08/15/118157125.html?pageNumber=1" title="">6 cents</a> in damages.</p><p>Now the stakes were higher: the ability of the national media to write about the civil rights movement as it unfolded across the South.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>To handle the Supreme </strong>Court appeal, The Times hired a Columbia University law professor named Herbert Wechsler. He argued that in an era when government officials like Sullivan were weaponizing libel law, a hands-off approach was dangerously outdated. People had a right to protect their reputations, but the First Amendment barred the government from impeding a free press. The Alabama verdict made it so perilous “to criticize official conduct that it abridges the freedom of the press,” Wechsler wrote in the appeal. “It transforms the action for defamation from a method of protecting private reputation to a device for insulating government against attack.” He proposed a new framework: To win damages, a government official should be required to prove that the defendant knew that what he was writing was false.</p><p>The Supreme Court accepted the case for review. To prepare, Wechsler, his wife and a colleague dived into the history of the First Amendment. The surviving records of the debates among the framers of the Constitution shed little light on precisely what they intended, and the amendment’s text was short and vague — ambiguity, perhaps, that was designed to preserve flexibility for future generations to reinterpret the amendment’s 45 words as the world evolved.</p><p>One clue to at least some of the framers’ thinking emerged during the heated national debate over the 1798 Sedition Act, which penalized criticism of the government. The act’s swift demise — and the contemporary consensus that it ran counter to the young nation’s ideals — was evidence to Wechsler that, from the outset, the First Amendment was designed to protect citizens’ rights to sharply question their government. By rendering and then upholding a libel verdict that was meant to stifle outside scrutiny, Alabama’s courts had infringed upon that right.</p><p>Despite its long odds, the appeal garnered considerable attention, in part because the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Earl Warren, had recently become the country’s most powerful champion of civil liberties. Around the time that the court was hearing New York Times v. Sullivan, it was also preparing to issue major rulings governing desegregation, school prayer and obscenity. In one sign of the Sullivan case’s cachet, Dr. King showed up to witness oral arguments in January 1964; one justice asked the civil rights leader to autograph a copy of his book, “Stride Toward Freedom,” about the bus boycotts in Alabama.</p><p>Two months later, the court announced its unanimous decision. It was a stunner: The justices found that Alabama courts had violated the constitutional protections of free speech and a free press. William J. Brennan Jr. wrote the court’s majority opinion on behalf of himself and five other justices. As a starting point, he noted that the case was being heard “against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.” Maintaining that commitment was a central purpose of the First Amendment, and it was the prism through which L.B. Sullivan’s libel lawsuit — and the Alabama courts’ handling of it — needed to be viewed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Yes, there had been inaccuracies in the “Heed Their Rising Voices” ad, but “erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate,” and writers and publishers needed “breathing space” to engage in robust argument and criticism without worrying that a factual slip-up could cause financial ruin. Brennan was essentially adopting the framework that Wechsler proposed for evaluating libel claims by a government official like Sullivan. Such a figure could not collect damages “unless he proves that the statement was made with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not,” Brennan wrote. Deliberate smears were actionable; accidental errors were not. The burden of proof would rest with the plaintiff.</p><p>L.B. Sullivan’s efforts to intimidate the press had backfired to such a degree that his name would live on as an enduring symbol of American press freedoms. And Brennan’s 39-page majority opinion was just the start. (The three other justices signed on to concurring opinions that espoused even broader interpretations of the First Amendment: that public officials should be barred, even in cases of deliberate falsehoods, from bringing libel claims against their critics.) In the coming years, the court delivered a succession of rulings that built on the landmark case. In 1967, there was Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, which expanded Sullivan’s logic to apply to public figures — business leaders, celebrities or university presidents, for example — in addition to government officials. “Our citizenry has a legitimate and substantial interest in the conduct of such persons, and freedom of the press to engage in uninhibited debate about their involvement in public issues and events is as crucial as it is in the case of ‘public officials,’” Chief Justice Warren wrote in that case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Supreme Court that decided Times v.

Robert Welch Inc., the court further broadened that group to include what are known as “limited purpose public figures.” These were people who weren’t necessarily famous but had injected themselves into a public controversy by, for example, becoming prominent activists for or against abortion rights. The 5-to-4 decision even acknowledged that in rare cases, someone might fall under this umbrella involuntarily. (Think of an air traffic controller on duty when a plane crashes.) The logic was the same: People needed to be able to investigate and write about those in the public sphere, even if they accidentally got a fact wrong.</p><p>This was hardly the end of libel lawsuits. There were plenty in the years ahead — by some counts, even more than before Sullivan. The decision was a protection for journalists working in good faith, but not for those who lied or exhibited a reckless disregard for the truth. (Private people had to clear a much lower bar to win libel suits; they typically just had to show that someone had acted negligently, not that they had known that what they were writing was false.) Some suits succeeded. Many others failed. But Sullivan and its successor cases changed the dynamic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Journalists and publishers now knew that as long as they were making a good-faith effort to ascertain the truth, they were free to dig into the rich, famous and powerful. This realization — along with factors like the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act, which made it much easier to obtain government records — helped usher in a new age of American journalism devoted to exposing malfeasance, questioning authority and promoting the public interest.</p><p>Reporters uncovered wrongdoing in Vietnam, the White House and the Pentagon. It was not a coincidence that The Washington Post cracked open Watergate in the years after Sullivan; if the burden of proof in a defamation case had still rested with the defendant, and if even honest mistakes had remained punishable under the law, the costs of publishing such a series of investigations might have been prohibitive. (As his presidency circled the drain, Richard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/24/archives/nixon-and-a-right-of-reply.html" title="">Nixon blamed</a> the Sullivan decision and had his administration draft legislation that he hoped would make it easier for politicians to win libel lawsuits.) Journalists — along with activists like Ralph Nader — dug into the tobacco, auto and chemical industries, whose top executives knew they were distributing deadly products. And they revealed the crimes, lies and half-truths of actual and aspiring presidents, senators, governors, cabinet secretaries and Supreme Court justices.</p><p>In short, the actual-malice standard would distinguish the United States, with its tradition of unbridled free speech and expression, from many other democracies, and it would become an indispensable safeguard for American journalists and everyday citizens who hoped to hold their leaders and other powerful actors to account.</p><p><strong>For decades, support </strong>for Sullivan and the court’s ensuing libel decisions was widespread, across the political spectrum. As recently as 2010, Congress <a href="https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ223/PLAW-111publ223.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed a law</a> that endorsed “the full extent of free-speech protections to authors and publishers that are available in the United States” and criticized the weaker protections against libel lawsuits that exist in other countries. In a barely recognizable act of bipartisan unity, not a single lawmaker in either chamber voted against the legislation.</p><p>But beneath the surface, dissent was building. In 1993, the future Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan — then an assistant law professor at the University of Chicago — wrote <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=11530&amp;context=journal_articles" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an academic article</a> questioning some aspects of the Sullivan decision and related libel cases. (She worried that by freeing news outlets from the fear of litigation, the ruling facilitated the “tabloidization” of the mainstream media, and she thought that too many people — not just powerful government leaders — lacked recourse when they were defamed.) In a 2012 <a href="https://charlierose.com/videos/17653" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Charlie Rose, Justice Antonin Scalia said that he abhorred the Sullivan precedent. A small handful of conservative academics and lawyers who specialized in suing the media echoed those sentiments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Then, in February 2016, Donald Trump arrived at the sprawling Fort Worth Convention Center in Texas for a rally. After placing second in the Iowa caucuses, he had won the next three contests. Super Tuesday, in which Republican voters in 11 states would cast their votes for their party’s nominee, was looming, and Trump was campaigning in Texas — home to his rival Ted Cruz — looking for a knockout.</p><p>The crowd cheered and hooted and waved TRUMP placards. The candidate seemed to feed off the audience’s energy. After a while, Trump turned to one of his favorite targets.</p><p>“I’ll tell you what,” he declared. “I think the media is among the most dishonest groups of people I’ve ever met. They’re terrible.” Trump licked his lips. “Believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems. They’re going to have such problems. And one of the things I’m going to do — and this is only going to make it tougher for me, and I’ve never said this before — but one of the things I’m going to do, if I win, and I hope I do, and we’re certainly leading, is I’m going to open up our libel laws, so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.” Wild applause. “So we’re going to open up those libel laws, folks, and we’re going to have people sue you like you’ve never got sued before.”</p><p>This was a bizarre vow, apparently the first time a major presidential candidate had used the reform of libel laws in a stump speech. In any case, there was no need to “open up our libel laws” to hold reporters to account for writing purposely false articles. The actual-malice standard covered that; there was no legal protection for people writing something defamatory that they knew to be false. Plus, this wasn’t a law that the president or Congress could tinker with. It was a question of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the First Amendment.</p><p>While it was easy to dismiss Trump’s vow as the confused rant of someone whose career had been defined in part by threatening and sometimes filing libel lawsuits, almost always without success, his words served as a starter’s pistol for an assault on the Sullivan decision. The campaign faced long odds — many of the court’s justices had expressed support for the precedent, which protected conservative outlets as well as traditional media — but it would soon gain powerful new backers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Just weeks after Trump’s rally in Fort Worth, a Florida jury handed down a crippling verdict in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit that the wrestler Hulk Hogan — with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html" title="">secret backing</a> of the tech billionaire Peter Thiel — had filed against the website Gawker. Then, just days before Trump won the election, a dean at the University of Virginia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/business/media/rolling-stone-rape-story-case-guilty.html" title="">prevailed</a> in a multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit against Rolling Stone magazine. The victories showcased the power of litigation to kneecap prominent publishers, and the triumphant lawyers in the two cases would use their newfound fame to become leading advocates of overturning Sullivan.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hulk Hogan, with his lawyers David Houston and Charles Harder, after the Gawker verdict in 2016.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dirk Shadd/The Tampa Bay Times, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Charles Harder was one of the attorneys who represented Hulk Hogan — and, starting in late 2016, the Trump family. “I think the actual-malice standard is too stringent,” he <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ailes-media-litigator-charles-harder-930963/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> The Hollywood Reporter that fall. Two months later, he <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/charles-harder-gawker-lawyer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, ruefully, that “there are a lot of celebrities and public figures who don’t bring lawsuits because the standard is so high.” (This conveniently ignored the victories that Harder and other lawyers had won in and out of court, as well as the other successes — such as articles that were diluted or never saw the light of day — that they achieved by merely threatening to sue.)</p><p>About a year later, Harder got a call from a lawyer representing an actress named Kathrine McKee. McKee had accused Bill Cosby of rape. Cosby’s lawyer responded by calling McKee a liar. McKee sued for defamation. But her case had been dismissed, with federal judges finding that McKee was a public figure and that Cosby technically did not defame her.</p><p>Harder and a colleague volunteered to handle an appeal to the Supreme Court. In their <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1542/45213/20180501102009877_Petition%20for%20Writ%20of%20Certiorari%20ONLY.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">petition</a> for a writ of certiorari, they argued that the justices should narrow the definition of who qualified as public figures and therefore had to satisfy the actual-malice standard. The Supreme Court refuses to hear more than 99 percent of the appeals it receives, usually without a word of explanation, but Harder was hopeful. He thought the case was a promising vehicle for chipping away at the application of Sullivan and its progeny.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Ten months after the petition was filed, in February 2019, the Supreme Court announced, in a single sentence, that it would not accept the McKee case for review. But there was an enormous asterisk — one that transformed what might have been a resounding defeat into a major victory for Harder and his allies.</p><p>Justice Thomas wrote <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1542_ihdk.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an opinion</a> declaring that, while he agreed that the court should not hear McKee’s appeal, the justices should use a more “appropriate case” in the future to reconsider Sullivan. His argument was unrelated to McKee and Cosby. His point was that the text of the First Amendment said nothing about protecting libelous speech about public figures. Before the Sullivan decision, libel was a matter of state law, not federal, and that was where it belonged, Thomas argued. “The States are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm,” he wrote.</p><p>This was manifestly untrue. The Supreme Court created the actual-malice standard because courts in Southern states were incapable of striking such a balance and instead were allowing local officials to use libel lawsuits to punish news organizations that covered the civil rights movement.</p><p>Even so, and despite the fact that Thomas was writing only for himself, his words carried weight; he was perhaps the foremost figure in the conservative legal movement, certainly in the federal judiciary. His denunciation of Sullivan would reverberate loudly — with judges, activists and lawyers like Roy Katriel.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth McNamara, the </strong>lawyer for Guy Lawson and Simon &amp; Schuster, had taken to constantly refreshing the Supreme Court’s website each morning that decisions were due to be announced, waiting to learn whether the court would accept Katriel’s plea to resuscitate Berisha v. Lawson. On July 2, 2021, she got the answer she was looking for. “The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.” The Supreme Court would not hear the appeal. The journalist had won. The Albanian politician’s son had lost. McNamara’s initial reaction was relief. Then she realized there was more to it than the single sentence — <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-1063_new_gfbi.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">11 pages more</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Thomas had written a dissent, declaring that he would have taken the case and used it, just as Katriel had suggested, to reconsider the actual-malice standard. In the McKee case, Thomas argued that Sullivan strayed from the original meaning of the First Amendment. Now the justice took a new tack, arguing that “lies impose real harm.” He cited a few examples. One was the 2016 shooting at a Washington pizzeria that online conspiracists baselessly claimed was the headquarters of a pedophilia ring involving Hillary Clinton. “Or,” he added, “consider how online posts falsely labeling someone as ‘a thief, a fraudster, and a pedophile’ can spark the need to set up a home-security system,” which was a reference to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/technology/change-my-google-results.html" title="">a Times article</a> about a Canadian woman who was accused of defaming her perceived enemies online. The court, Thomas wrote, should no longer “insulate those who perpetrate lies from traditional remedies like libel suits.”</p><p>Thomas didn’t explain how a lower bar for libel suits could have helped dissuade thousands of social media users from peddling the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. And the case of the Canadian woman also had nothing to do with Sullivan. (It wasn’t even a matter of American libel law.) A Canadian judge had ordered the woman to stop posting about some of the litigants. She disobeyed. It was up to her victims to get American tech companies to remove her defamatory online posts, and when many refused, there was little recourse: The websites couldn’t be held liable because of a federal law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, that insulated companies from liability for what users posted on their online platforms.</p><p>Thomas, it seemed, was performing a sleight of hand, using the unquestionable spread of disinformation on social media as ammunition to roll back safeguards that protected the traditional media.</p><p>For McNamara, the real surprise came when she flipped the page. Thomas’s opinion had been fairly predictable. But he wasn’t the only justice who dissented. Neil Gorsuch did, too.</p><p>Gorsuch acknowledged that back in 1964, the Supreme Court had a compelling reason to create the actual-malice standard: to shield the handful of national news organizations from crippling libel lawsuits whenever they wrote about powerful people or institutions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>But over the ensuing decades, Gorsuch explained, the media landscape had changed. Major newspapers were whispers of their former selves. Into the void spilled 24-hour cable news and online news platforms that were beholden to virality and clicks, not truth and accuracy. At the time of the Sullivan decision, Gorsuch continued, “many major media outlets employed fact-checkers and editors, and one could argue that most strived to report true stories” because readers would pay more for reliable information. “Less clear is what sway these justifications hold in a new era where the old economic model that supported reporters, fact-checking, and editorial oversight is disappearing.”</p><p><strong>Where was Gorsuch </strong>coming up with this? Primarily, it turned out, from a recent law-review article that its author — David Logan, a professor and former dean at the Roger Williams University School of Law in Rhode Island — had sent to two of Gorsuch’s colleagues on the court. Over the course of his eight-page dissent, Gorsuch referred to Logan’s piece 17 times. And when it came to numbers to support his argument, the justice leaned almost entirely on data included in Logan’s article.</p><p>Supreme Court justices routinely cite academic work in their opinions, perhaps hoping that the implied rigor of scholarly publishing will bolster the credibility of their arguments. But Gorsuch’s near-total reliance on a single professor’s paper was extraordinary — especially because Logan was hardly a star, regularly churning out scholarly papers that, he told me, seemed to vanish into a void.</p><p>Logan had previously regarded the Sullivan decision as a landmark civil rights victory. But his thinking started to change in the Trump era, amid rising tides of misinformation. Logan wondered if this had something to do with the rarity of successful libel lawsuits, a trend he <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1073865" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously studied</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-36"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago in December, two days after Disney agreed to settle a defamation case he brought.

Sullivan.” Much of the 56-page paper was devoted to a pair of analytical arguments. In the first, Logan claimed that the high threshold that Sullivan erected against defamation lawsuits by public figures contributed to the tsunami of sensationalism and disinformation that was swamping online media.</p><p>It was quite a leap. There was no denying that social media was a powerful channel for misinforming citizens and tarnishing reputations. Nor was there any doubt that the purveyors of online lies rarely faced legal consequences. But that reflected how difficult it was to sue such people — mostly anonymous (and presumably not very wealthy) Twitter and Facebook trolls. In addition, social media companies were protected by Section 230. Logan devoted barely a paragraph to that law. How was any of this the fault of Sullivan? His paper didn’t explain.</p><p>Logan’s other argument was similarly tortured. To win damages in defamation cases, public figures had to prove that publishers knew that what they were publishing was probably false. Logan asserted that this had given publishers reason to think that “publishing without verification is the safest legal route, as an attempt to verify that turns up contrary information before publication can constitute reckless disregard for the truth and support liability. As a result, publishers are incentivized to do little or no fact-checking, confident that the more slipshod their investigation, the less likely they are to be guilty of ‘actual malice.’ In short, under an ‘actual malice’ regime, ignorance is bliss.”</p><p>To support this inflammatory hypothesis — that journalists would knowingly publish questionable information, because the act of trying to determine its accuracy would expose them to liability — Logan provided no evidence or examples. Had he spoken to a single reporter, editor, publisher, media executive or practicing First Amendment lawyer to ascertain whether there was even a kernel of truth to his theory? He told me that he had not. His argument, he said, was based on logic. “It was the product of an academic doing his research,” he explained when I pushed him on this. “We don’t actually road-test” theories with people who have real-world experience, he added, noting that this was why the academy was often referred to as the “ivory tower.”</p><p>It wasn’t until near the end of the paper that Logan presented his most substantive findings. He had analyzed data compiled by the Media Law Resource Center, a group for lawyers that defend news outlets. He found that the number of trials involving First Amendment cases against media companies had declined from an average of 27 a year in the 1980s to just three in 2017. (He failed to mention that a virtually identical trend had reduced the number of all federal civil trials over the same period. In other words, there was no reason to think this trend was peculiar to First Amendment cases or had anything to do with Sullivan.) Generalizing from a small number of recent trials, Logan concluded that media outlets’ rate of success was inching higher.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>Moreover, he asserted, even when media outlets lost, they often avoided paying damages. For example, he wrote, less than 10 percent of the time that juries awarded damages in such lawsuits did the payouts survive appeals. “In sum,” he concluded, “the threat that defendants today face from libel litigation is virtually nil.”</p><p>Logan was nearing retirement, and he knew the article was the last of his four-decade career. He really hoped it would get noticed. He placed an order for dozens of printed copies from Ohio State. He sent them to academics and other thought leaders. He also mailed a copy to Justice Thomas, who a year earlier made waves with his opinion in the McKee case. He sent another copy to Justice Kagan, who wrote the law-review article questioning aspects of Sullivan and whom he had known for years as a fellow law-school dean.</p><p><strong>At the heart of </strong>Gorsuch’s opinion was the premise that “the actual malice standard has evolved from a high bar to recovery into an effective immunity from liability.” This was not a new argument, but thanks to Logan, Gorsuch now could marshal data: The number of media-defamation trials had gone from an average of 27 a year to three in the most recent year studied, he wrote. Gorsuch noted that even when a plaintiff managed to win damages at trial, those awards withstood appeals only one out of 10 times. “The bottom line? It seems that publishing <em>without</em> investigation, fact-checking, or editing has become the optimal legal strategy,” Gorsuch wrote, before quoting Logan’s claim that “ignorance is bliss.” It was time, he concluded, to reconsider Sullivan.</p><blockquote><h2>‘It was like lightning striking. How many of us write a law-review article that kick-starts a national conversation?’</h2></blockquote><p>The outcome wasn’t quite what Roy Katriel hoped for when he volunteered to take the appeal, but getting a second justice to declare his support for reconsidering Sullivan nonetheless felt like a win. His client, Shkelzen Berisha, agreed. The dissents showed that his lawsuit “was not a baloney thing,” Berisha told me.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>From his home office, Logan read Gorsuch’s dissent with giddy disbelief. He had never seen a Supreme Court opinion lean so heavily on a single academic source — and that academic was him! Congratulatory calls and emails poured in. Logan was interviewed by CNN and NPR. “It was like lightning striking,” he told me over lunch at a Manhattan steakhouse. “How many of us write a law-review article that kick-starts a national conversation?”</p><p>He was right. The addition of Gorsuch’s voice to the growing chorus calling for a reconsideration of Sullivan triggered a flurry of news articles, op-eds, TV and radio coverage and academic and political discussions — and, among the proponents of overturning Sullivan, rejoicing.</p><p>“Sheer brilliance,” <a href="https://x.com/libbylocke/status/1411059904740212738" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> the lawyer Libby Locke, one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/business/media/clare-locke-dominion-voting-fox-defamation.html" title="">loudest voices</a> calling for Sullivan’s reversal. She <a href="https://x.com/libbylocke/status/1411058914230157313" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quoted</a> Gorsuch’s line about only one in 10 jury awards surviving on appeal.</p><p>Logan had arrived at that stark ratio by extrapolating from a table in a Media Law Resource Center report that looked at dozens of media trials. From 2010 to 2017, there were 21 cases in which juries awarded damages to plaintiffs that were upheld by the trial court. In only two of those cases — 9.5 percent of the total, or one in 10 — did judges affirm the damages on appeal.</p><p>But that didn’t mean that the damages in the other 19 cases were overturned. In fact, eight of those cases were settled before any appeal. Four more were never appealed at all. And the appeals in three other cases were pending at the time the report was published. That left just six cases in which higher courts had ruled on damages. In four of those cases, appeals courts modified the damages awarded by jurors. In the other two, the damages were affirmed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>Those numbers told a very different story from what Logan implied and Gorsuch seized on. It was not true that only one in 10 jury awards survived on appeal. The true figure was much higher: one in three. And the ratio was based on a sample size of six, so tiny that it was ridiculous to try to draw any serious conclusions.</p><p>Michael Norwick, an attorney at the Media Law Resource Center, helped compile the data on which Logan based his article. Five days after the Supreme Court rejected the Berisha petition, Norwick sent a letter to Gorsuch via the court’s public information officer. “I write to point out inaccuracies in the Dissent in hope that you will consider amending it,” he wrote, before detailing the problems with the data.</p><p>Nobody responded. But a few weeks later, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-1063diff_dc8e.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">altered</a> Gorsuch’s dissent. Among other changes, the line about only one in 10 awards surviving on appeal became one in three. (“This is the closest I will get in my career to winning a case before the Supreme Court,” Norwick joked to friends.) Despite the quiet correction, the false one-in-10 figure would become a talking point for lawyers and others seeking to overturn Sullivan.</p><p>Norwick also sent his letter to Logan. He didn’t reply. The professor told me that any mistake in his article “didn’t strike me one way or the other as being significant.” His article about how the media deliberately avoids the truth wasn’t clarified or corrected.</p><p><strong>Will the Sullivan decision </strong>survive<strong> </strong>Trump’s second term? That will be up to the Supreme Court. The first step would be for the court to decide to hear a case that might give it the opportunity to reconsider the 61-year-old precedent. Four justices need to vote to accept a case; so far, there appear to be only two votes: Thomas and Gorsuch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><p>There are reasons for skepticism that another two votes exist. In 2023, in a case involving a Colorado man sending threatening messages to a prominent local singer, most of the justices embraced the logic behind Sullivan. Notably, the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-138_43j7.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">majority opinion</a> was written by Justice Kagan, the author of the long-ago law-review article questioning the court’s libel precedents. And shortly before Trump was sworn in this year, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-217_9o6b.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a majority opinion</a> in an unrelated case that cited Sullivan as established precedent. Some lawyers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/supreme-court-libel-precedent.html" title="">saw this</a> as evidence that the ruling was safe, at least for the time being.</p><blockquote><h2>‘Plaintiff respectfully requests that the court revisit the actual-malice standard under New York Times v. Sullivan.&#39;</h2></blockquote><p>But even if most of the justices are satisfied with Sullivan, what about the precedents that extended the actual-malice standard to a wide range of public figures, not just government officials? Kagan sharply criticized those rulings in her law-review article. Short of reconsidering Sullivan, one option for the court would be to accept a case — like Steve Wynn’s — that seeks to roll back those subsequent precedents and make it easier for those who don’t hold elected office to win libel lawsuits.</p><p>Or what if the president himself were to ask the court — which has shown a willingness not only to buck precedent but also, at times, to defer to Trump — to overturn or weaken Sullivan? Not in a speech or a social media post, but in a formal petition presented by reputable lawyers?</p><p>That possibility is not far-fetched. Last spring, Trump’s lawyers filed an appeal with the 11th Circuit in Atlanta — the same court that nearly three years earlier rejected Shkelzen Berisha’s appeal in his libel lawsuit against Guy Lawson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><p>Trump’s submission was related to a suit that he filed in federal court in 2022, claiming that CNN had defamed him by describing him as an authoritarian-minded liar and comparing him to Nazis. The suit was heard by Judge Raag Singhal, a Trump appointee who was no fan of the Sullivan decision or CNN. Yet Singhal dismissed Trump’s lawsuit, noting that CNN’s statements about Trump were opinions, not facts, and therefore were not defamatory.</p><p>Trump appealed last March. His lawyers disputed a number of Singhal’s conclusions, but they also made no secret of Trump’s backup plan if the appeal failed on the merits. “Plaintiff respectfully requests that the court revisit the actual-malice standard under New York Times v. Sullivan,” they wrote. “Recognizing this court cannot overrule Sullivan, Plaintiff makes this argument to preserve the issue in the event of further review.” The next stop, in other words, would be the Supreme Court.</p><p>The sense of Sullivan’s fragility is already influencing news outlets. After Trump won in November, ABC News had to decide what to do about a lawsuit that Trump filed against the broadcaster eight months earlier. The anchor George Stephanopoulos described a jury as having found Trump liable for raping the writer E. Jean Carroll, when in fact he had been found liable for the lesser offense of sexual abuse. The lawsuit claimed, implausibly, that Trump’s reputation was harmed by this imprecise description. The case was inching toward trial.</p><p>Executives at Disney, which owns ABC, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/media/disney-trump-abc-lawsuit.html" title="">reportedly</a> worried about their prospects with a jury in Florida, whose voters backed Trump in each of the past three elections and presumably had little affection for the mainstream media that Trump and his allies constantly assailed. If ABC lost at trial, the network could appeal, but that set it up for protracted litigation with a president whose administration was preparing a crackdown on the media. Executives at Disney also expressed fear that the case might somehow make its way up to the Supreme Court and become a vehicle for overturning Sullivan. It felt safer to settle — a clear illustration of how the long-running campaign to delegitimize the press and weaken its First Amendment protections is already having a chilling effect on media decision makers. In December, Disney agreed to fork over $15 million to Trump for his future presidential foundation, as well as an additional $1 million to cover his legal fees.</p><p>The settlement seemed to embolden Trump. A couple of days later, he gave a news conference at Mar-a-Lago and was asked whether he planned to file more defamation lawsuits.</p><p>“Oh, I do, I do,” Trump replied. After listing some of the journalists and news outlets that he has sued, the president-elect added: “I feel I have to do this. I shouldn’t really be the one to do it — it should have been the Justice Department or somebody else — but I have to do it. It costs a lot of money to do it, but we have to straighten out the press. Our press is very corrupt. Almost as corrupt as our elections.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Enrich is the business investigations editor for The Times.
