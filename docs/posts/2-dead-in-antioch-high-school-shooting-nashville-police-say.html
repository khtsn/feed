A male student was also being treated for what Mr. Aaron described as a facial injury, though it was not the result of a gunshot.</p><p>The gunman fired multiple shots in the school’s cafeteria after 11 a.m., with an emergency call coming in two minutes after the first shot, Mr. Aaron said. He did not provide any additional details about the shooter or the victims. Officials said they did not know the motive for the shooting.</p><p>A student, who gave his name only as Ahmad, told the Nashville TV station WSMV that he was in the cafeteria when gunfire erupted. He and his friends hid behind garbage cans before they could make their way to the football field as they passed victims who had been shot and were bleeding on the ground.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I wish I could save them,” he said. “I feel a lot of pain and grief and depression knowing that I can’t do a thing to help them, just seeing them get shot in front of my face like that.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Metro Nashville Public Schools <a href="https://x.com/MetroSchools/status/1882120603769147846" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the high school was on lockdown around noon local time. Officials had set up a reunification area for parents.</p><p>“I join Tennesseans in praying for the victims, their families &amp; the school community,” said Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, adding in a post on social media that he been briefed on the incident.</p><p>In Nashville, trauma still lingers from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nashville-school-shooting.html" title="">2023 shooting at the Covenant School</a>, which was the deadliest school shooting in state history. A former student breached the campus of the private school, killing three 9-year-old students and three staff members before police shot and killed the assailant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But even after thousands of protesters flooded the halls of the State Capitol, joining some parents of surviving students in pleas for tougher gun laws, the Republican supermajority in the Tennessee General Assembly has balked at changing the laws.</p><p>“Schools should be safe spaces where children can learn and grow without fear of violence,” said Voices for a Safer Tennessee, an organization founded in the aftermath of the Covenant School shooting to push for firearm restrictions, in a statement.</p><p>In 2024, over the objections of parents and many Democratic lawmakers in Nashville, lawmakers approved legislation that allowed teachers to carry a concealed handgun.</p><p>There has been support for increasing school resource officers: the Metro Council voted in December <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2024/12/18/metro-council-approves-school-resource-officer-funding/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to approve a $3.9 million grant</a>, though staffing shortages have prevented many of those schools from hiring officers. Mr. Aaron, the police spokesman, said that two student resource officers were on campus but not near the shooting when gunfire began. By the time they arrived, the shooting was over.</p><p>Charlane Oliver, a state senator who represents the district that includes Antioch High School, said in a statement that her heart was “broken over the devastating shooting.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“As a mother and a representative of this community, I grieve with the families, students, and staff who are enduring this unimaginable tragedy,” she said. “No child should ever feel unsafe in their school, and no family should face the anguish of such a senseless loss.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane">More about Emily Cochrane</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
