However, what makes the ordinary extraordinary is the intention of the artist who put this together.” I’m looking for four. There it is. $4 million. Say 5, please. $5 million. Don’t let it slip away. 5,100,000. The world’s most expensive banana. At 5,200,000. It’s slipping through the auction room at 5,200,000. And I’m going to sell it here. Fair warning. At $5,200,000.

Joy is not something to be messed with.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Indeed, Sun said in a statement that the Cattelan work “represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community.” </p><p>Sun, who watched the auction from Hong Kong, added that “in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture.”</p><p>On a phone call, he predicted that since the election of Donald J. Trump, and a rise in the value of cryptocurrencies, “I think we are still going to see strong art buying from the crypto community.”</p><p>The Cattelan artwork first appeared at Art Basel Miami Beach, where Perrotin Gallery sold three editions of “Comedian” for $120,000 to $150,000 each. But the crowds <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/arts/design/banana-removed-art-basel.html" title="">proved so disruptive</a> that the gallery eventually took the banana out of the booth after a performance artist, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/11/david-datuna-120000-banana-interview-art-basel-miami" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Datuna</a>, ripped it off the wall and ate it. At Sotheby’s, the banana returned with an estimate between $1 million and $1.5 million, but the final hammer price — $5.2 million, plus auction-house fees, for a total of $6.2 million — sextupled its low estimate.</p><p>The work became a media sensation, appearing on the cover of The New York Post. Some critics were more generous than the tabloids. Writing in The New York Times, Jason Farago explained that the title “Comedian” is ironic — “for Mr. Cattelan, like all the best clowns, is a tragedian who makes our certainties as slippery as a banana peel.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Back then, the artist said he conceived of his work as a satirical jab at market speculation, asking the question, “On what basis does an object acquire value in the art system?” In a recent email interview, he added that, “The auction will be the apex of its career. I’m eager to see what the answers will be.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The auctioneer Oliver Barker at Sotheby’s led the sale of “Comedian.” “These are words I never thought I would say: The banana has sold for $5.2 million,” Barker announced.

Running the stand was a man from Bangladesh who did not give his name and said that he was not aware that one of his bananas was selling for several thousand times its original price. </p><p>“I bet the Sotheby’s staff absolutely can’t wait to stop having to listen to banana jokes and pretend like it’s the first time they heard them,” said the art adviser David Norman. “It has to be excruciating!”</p><p>The banana also attracted scrutiny earlier this month, when a <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/about/team/michael-bouhanna" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sotheby’s executive</a>, Michael Bouhanna, anonymously released a cryptocurrency named after the satirical artwork. Online traders <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/1-million-trading-meme-coin-linked-sothebys-employee-2562835" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused him</a> of using insider information from the auction house to financially benefit from the token’s rising price. Bouhanna <a href="https://x.com/michaelbouhanna/status/1853128496672919684" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied the accusations</a>, saying in a statement that he “chose to launch the token anonymously, not wanting to associate it with my personal profile or professional affiliations.”</p><p>A few hours before the auction began, the cryptocurrency — known online as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/technology/memecoins-crypto-surge.html" title="">memecoin</a> because of its volatile value — had a market cap of nearly $214 million.
