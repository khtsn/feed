It became what is arguably the most expensive fruit in the world — though it will likely be tossed in a couple days.</p><p>The banana is the star of a 2019 conceptual artwork, “Comedian,” by the noted prankster Maurizio Cattelan, which is intended to be duct-taped onto the wall. It comes with a certificate of authenticity and installation instructions for owners to replace the banana — if they wish — whenever it rots. Five minutes of rapid bidding ended when the Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justinsun/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justin Sun</a> placed the winning bid, besting six other rivals, which experts said was a sign that even a struggling market would spend big on spectacle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Justin Sun, a crypto entrepreneur and art collector, shown in New York City in 2019.

Joy is not something to be messed with.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Indeed, Sun said in a statement that the Cattelan work “represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community.” </p><p>Sun, who watched the auction from Hong Kong, added that “in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture.”</p><p>On a phone call, he predicted that since the election of Donald J. Trump, and a rise in the value of cryptocurrencies, “I think we are still going to see strong art buying from the crypto community.”</p><p>The Cattelan artwork first appeared at Art Basel Miami Beach, where Perrotin Gallery sold three editions of “Comedian” for $120,000 to $150,000 each. But the crowds <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/arts/design/banana-removed-art-basel.html" title="">proved so disruptive</a> that the gallery eventually took the banana out of the booth after a performance artist, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/11/david-datuna-120000-banana-interview-art-basel-miami" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Datuna</a>, ripped it off the wall and ate it. At Sotheby’s, the banana returned with an estimate between $1 million and $1.5 million, but the final hammer price — $5.2 million, plus auction-house fees, for a total of $6.2 million — sextupled its low estimate.</p><p>The work became a media sensation, appearing on the cover of The New York Post. Some critics were more generous than the tabloids. Writing in The New York Times, Jason Farago explained that the title “Comedian” is ironic — “for Mr. Cattelan, like all the best clowns, is a tragedian who makes our certainties as slippery as a banana peel.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Back then, the artist said he conceived of his work as a satirical jab at market speculation, asking the question, “On what basis does an object acquire value in the art system?” In a recent email interview, he added that, “The auction will be the apex of its career. I’m eager to see what the answers will be.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The auctioneer Oliver Barker at Sotheby’s led the sale of “Comedian.” “These are words I never thought I would say: The banana has sold for $5.2 million,” Barker announced.

Running the stand was a man from Bangladesh who did not give his name and said that he was not aware that one of his bananas was selling for several thousand times its original price. </p><p>“I bet the Sotheby’s staff absolutely can’t wait to stop having to listen to banana jokes and pretend like it’s the first time they heard them,” said the art adviser David Norman. “It has to be excruciating!”</p><p>The banana also attracted scrutiny earlier this month, when a <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/about/team/michael-bouhanna" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sotheby’s executive</a>, Michael Bouhanna, anonymously released a cryptocurrency named after the satirical artwork. Online traders <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/1-million-trading-meme-coin-linked-sothebys-employee-2562835" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused him</a> of using insider information from the auction house to financially benefit from the token’s rising price. Bouhanna <a href="https://x.com/michaelbouhanna/status/1853128496672919684" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied the accusations</a>, saying in a statement that he “chose to launch the token anonymously, not wanting to associate it with my personal profile or professional affiliations.”</p><p>A few hours before the auction began, the cryptocurrency — known online as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/technology/memecoins-crypto-surge.html" title="">memecoin</a> because of its volatile value — had a market cap of nearly $214 million. (Bouhanna declined through a spokesman to say what his personal financial stake in the token was.) </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Two men that competed in the bidding war, up to around $2.5 million,<span>  </span>had invested in Bouhanna’s cryptocurrency. One of the men, Theodore Bi, called the work “an idea anyone can get behind” and said they had intended to give it as a gift to Elon Musk.</p><p>Sun, the winner, has spent millions on traditional and digital art. His collection ranges from a 1947 sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, purchased at auction for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/12/arts/design/nft-collectors-artwork.html" title="">$78.4 million</a> in 2021, to a nearly <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/stories/2021/08/23/justin-sun-buys-nft-rock-half-million-dollars" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$600,000</a> NFT of a pet rock.</p><p>“The conceptual nature of the artwork has drawn interest not only from our traditional collecting community but also from the wider crypto community,” Karina Sokolovsky, a Sotheby’s spokeswoman, acknowledged. “We’ve received requests from potential bidders to pay with crypto.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The artist Maurizio Cattelan has said he conceived of his banana artwork as a satirical jab at market speculation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Cattelan, 64, who in 2016 installed a solid-gold toilet in <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/maurizio-cattelan-america" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum</a>, and once duct-taped his own dealer to the wall of a gallery, has often criticized the art market, saying auctions are unfair to artists, who do not generally stand to benefit (except in publicity). “What bothers me is that after the first sale, the artist no longer profits as the work changes hands,” he said in an interview. “Auction houses and collectors reap the benefits, while the creator, who makes the very object driving the market, is left out.”</p><p>The banana was the last of just 10 lots sold in the “Now” portion of Sotheby’s two-section contemporary art sale on Wednesday, which realized a total of $16.5 million, well above their $12 million combined top estimate. By comparison, the equivalent “Now” auction in 2022 — the last boom year for the art market — had 23 lots and raised $72.9 million.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Moses, the financial analyst, said that buying the banana would be a risky bet from an investment perspective; few artworks dealing in shock value have seen positive returns on repeat auction sales. “The buyer needs to be bulking up on joy utility, because it’s not clear to me that this will be an addition to wealth utility,” he said.</p><p><em>Julia Halperin and Scott Reyburn contributed reporting</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zachary Small is a Times reporter writing about the art world’s relationship to money, politics and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zachary-small">More about Zachary Small</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Vast World of Art and Design</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Art Deco’s Bad Girl</strong><strong>: </strong>The painter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/arts/design/tamara-de-lempicka-san-francisco-madonna-survey-de-young.html">Tamara de Lempicka’s first major U.S. survey</a> invokes her as a trailblazing techno-feminist who borrowed freely from art history.
