David Mencer, a government spokesman, said, “Israel is issuing tens of thousands of call-up orders to reservists in order to strengthen and expand our operation in Gaza.”</p><p>He added that the goal of the expanded operation was to increase the pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and to destroy all of Hamas’s infrastructure, both above and below ground. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The campaign calls for “the expanding and the holding of territories” in Gaza by Israeli soldiers for an indefinite period of time, Mr. Mencer said. He said forces would remain in areas that are seized “to prevent Hamas from taking it back.”</p><p>The cabinet also approved a new Israeli-backed mechanism for allowing the distribution of humanitarian help, Mr. Mencer said. Israel has blocked all aid, including food, fuel and medicine, from entering Gaza for more than two months, the effect of which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">“catastrophic,</a>” doctors say. Israel has argued that the blockade is lawful and that Gaza still has enough available provisions.</p><p>As part of the Israeli offensive, Israel would move “the Gazan population south for its own defense,” Mr. Mencer said. The plan echoed Israel’s actions earlier in the war, when Israel ordered a mass evacuation of northern Gaza before its ground invasion in late 2023.</p><p>Two reservists who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to make comments to the news media said that they had received call-up orders beginning in June.</p><p>An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational planning, said the understanding was that the Israeli military would move to capture more territory beyond what it was already holding, but the official cautioned that it was not clear whether Israel had plans to occupy all of Gaza at this point.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A full-blown occupation would almost certainly spur international objections, as would the forced relocation of Palestinians from their homes in the north.</p><p>And it is not clear how additional fighters would fundamentally alter a dynamic seen over 18 months of war in which hundreds of thousands of soldiers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-offensive-hamas-war-katz.html" title="">pummeled Hamas fighters</a>, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">residents in Gaza</a> caught in the middle, but have failed to achieve Israel’s goals of destroying the militant group or releasing all hostages.</p><p>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli military forces near the border with Gaza on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Menahem Kahana/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The question is whether a return to that kind of fighting is a road map to the end of hostilities or merely an intensification of a deadly conflict with worsening consequences for Palestinians and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-passover.html" title="">Israeli hostages still being held</a> by Hamas.</p><p>Tamir Hayman, who served as the Israeli military’s intelligence chief for four years, said the attempts to pressure Hamas with overwhelming force had been “exhausted” after more than a year and a half of war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Eliminating Hamas as a terror organization by military force only is very difficult,” said Mr. Hayman, who is now executive director of the Institute for National Security Studies, a think tank in Tel Aviv. He said Israel would be better off ending the war with Hamas, which has been weakened significantly and can be kept in check after the fighting ends.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A charity kitchen in Jabaliya last month.

But two Israeli officials, who requested anonymity to comment on military plans, say it will involve several brigades seeking so-called operational superiority in several parts of Gaza.</p><p>The Trump administration has sought a new cease-fire, but Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm, which the group has refused to do.</p><p>The Israeli call-up of soldiers is also a message to Mr. Netanyahu’s hard-line supporters, some of whom were dismayed that the military had not completed the task of eradicating Hamas. Promising a more intense phase of the war could be good domestic politics for him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Israeli officials have said they believe it was the power and intensity of their military campaign in Gaza last year that pressured Hamas to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages-prisoner-release.html" title="">release some of the hostages</a> and to accept a cease-fire in January.</p><p>Hours after the Hamas terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people in Israel, with 251 others taken hostage, Mr. Netanyahu ordered the mobilization of 360,000 reservists, adding to the country’s standing military of about 170,000 soldiers.</p><p>In the fighting since, more than 50,000 Palestinians have died, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and military deaths. About 130 hostages have been released and the Israeli military has retrieved the bodies of at least 40 others. Around 24 hostages are thought to be still alive, according to the Israeli government.</p><p>When Israel and Hamas agreed to the January cease-fire deal, Mr. Netanyahu said credit should go to the “painful blows that our heroic fighters have landed on Hamas.”</p><p>“This is exactly how the conditions were created for the turning point in its position and for the release of our hostages,” he said during a national address.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But other voices, like Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, have expressed grave doubts about the strategy. “I fear that the intensity of the fighting will dictate the fate of the hostages,” Mr. Lapid said on Israeli Army Radio. “What is the goal? Why are they calling up reservists? Extending regular service and all without defining a goal — that’s not how you win a war.”</p><p>In a statement Monday, the organization representing the families of hostages urged the government not to widen the war.</p><p>“The expansion of military operations puts every hostage at grave risk,” the families said. “We implore our decision makers: Prioritize the hostages. Secure a deal. Bring them home — before it’s too late.”</p><p>Natan Odenheimer<!-- --> and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
