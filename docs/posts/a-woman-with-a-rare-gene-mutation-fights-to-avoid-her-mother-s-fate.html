Her husband was dropping off their older daughter at school. Their younger daughter was downstairs, occupied by a screen. Linde wanted to be alone when she learned whether she carried the family curse.</p><p>Linde’s mother, Allison, had died just four weeks before, after a mutant gene gradually laid waste to her brain. In her 50s, Allison transformed from a joyful family ringleader into an impulsive, deceptive pariah. She drove like a maniac on cul-de-sacs. She pinched strangers, shoplifted craft supplies and stole money from her daughter.</p><p>Now, on this morning in September 2021, Linde would find out if she had inherited the same vile genetic mutation.</p><p>She had a bad feeling. She and her mother had been so alike. Allison had been a physical therapist and Linde was a nurse. They were both doers — taking charge, mending wounds, planning theme parties. They were both chipper and a bit unfiltered, easy to a smirk or a four-letter word.</p><p><em>She probably gave me this, too,</em> Linde thought<em>.</em></p><p>The doctor finally popped up on the computer. Wasting no time on pleasantries, she shared her screen and zoomed in on one line of laboratory paperwork: POSITIVE.</p><p>Linde was 33. Within about two decades, in all likelihood, her daughters would watch her become selfish, manipulative, reckless — the opposite of everything she’d taught them to be. Just like Allison, Linde would turn into someone hard to tolerate, let alone love.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-1"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="22linde-grid" data-id="100000009881218" data-source-id="100000009881218"><div slug="22linde-grid" data-sourceid="100000009881218" id="embed-id-100000009881218">
