The system, which has killed at least 36 people, is expected to unleash storms that could generate tornadoes across the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast.</p><p>The turbulent weather that has caused widespread destruction is part of a huge cross-country system that dropped hail — some as large as baseballs — and produced tornadoes Friday and Saturday that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/weather/weather-tornado-warning-south.html" title="">killed at least 23 people</a>.</p><p>The system also caused wildfires driven by hurricane-force winds, and dust storms that led to crashes that killed at least 13 people in Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.</p><p>On Sunday, the threat of tornadoes and thunderstorms is expected to be over in the South and will shift east, though at a level much lower than it was on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Forecasters said there would be a <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day2otlk.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slight risk</a> of severe storms and tornadoes from Central Florida to western Pennsylvania. However, a higher enhanced risk was in place for western and central Pennsylvania.</p><p>“I’m not expecting the coverage to be as significant and the storms to be as numerous in terms of the overall severity,” said Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. “But there’s still going to be a risk for tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds.”</p><p>Mr. Otto said that Mississippi and Alabama, which experienced the highest possible level of tornado risk on Saturday, “should have a relatively tranquil day on Sunday.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="15wea-tornadoes" data-id="100000010054470" data-source-id="100000010054470"><div slug="15wea-tornadoes" data-sourceid="100000010054470" id="embed-id-100000010054470">

The biggest concern for the Mid-Atlantic, from Virginia to New Jersey, will be strong, damaging winds, but there is also a risk of a few brief tornadoes.</p><p>The heaviest rainfall on Sunday is expected along the East Coast from South Carolina up to Massachusetts, with about one to two inches of rain possible.</p><p>A few locations in this area could record up to five inches, particularly in eastern Virginia and eastern North Carolina. New York City could record one to two inches of rain, depending on where thunderstorms are oriented.</p><p>This large storm system is expected to move offshore on Monday.</p><p>Mr. Otto said there was likely to be a break from the extreme and tempestuous weather for “at least a few to several days” but the overall pattern suggests that more storms will move across the country before the end of March.</p><p>“This is probably not the last time we’ll talk about severe thunderstorms in the next several weeks,” he said.</p><p>Yan Zhuang<!-- --> and <!-- -->Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
