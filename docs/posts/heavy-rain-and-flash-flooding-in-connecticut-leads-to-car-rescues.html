Emergency crews carried out widespread water rescues, especially in the Southbury area, and several mudslides were reported, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/crh/lsrmap.html?zoom=8&amp;lat=41.36&amp;lon=-71.64&amp;hr=48&amp;severe=1&amp;flooding=1&amp;other=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Weather Service</a>.</p><p>The New York City area was also getting inundated on Sunday evening, as heavy rains caused all major airports in the region to ground flights. Officials warned of potentially damaging wind gusts. Flash flood warnings were issued in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and several counties north and west of New York City.

Mr. Morgatto said he’s never seen flooding like this in the 70 years his family has owned the restaurant.</p><p>“I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. “Within hours it was flooded out.”</p><p>Elizabeth Savio, 23, a team manager at Panera Bread in Southbury, said Sunday afternoon that the intersection in front of the shopping center, which includes the store, had completely flooded, and that four cars had become submerged in the floodwaters.</p><p>She said that she had watched as a man swam to one of the cars to rescue the driver, and that she had helped the two of them reach Panera. The rescuer, Lucas Barber, then swam back to the car to retrieve the man’s prosthetic leg and his golden retriever.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Barber, 30, said: “I pulled over, grabbed some rope that’s in the back of my car for emergencies, and threw my phone and wallet on the seat and ran out there.” He said he had checked the other nearby cars to ensure they were empty but had seen that Patrick Jennings, the man he rescued, was still inside his vehicle.</p><p>Mr. Jennings called him a “savior.”</p><p>“He got me all the way out of the water, the dog comes swimming up and the rest is history,” Mr. Jennings said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In Newtown, the police department was overwhelmed with calls about non-life-threatening flooding and asked residents to call only in a true emergency, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0Z5UeczxERhsSfEkcmiaCN1nj3nsaf3cLQmuKLwLrYvv8a61xB9JgGC1SizHbyNTEl&amp;id=100069267277252" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the department posted</a> on Facebook.
