Emergency crews carried out widespread water rescues, especially in the Southbury area, and several mudslides were reported, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/crh/lsrmap.html?zoom=8&amp;lat=41.36&amp;lon=-71.64&amp;hr=48&amp;severe=1&amp;flooding=1&amp;other=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Weather Service</a>.</p><p>Rivers breached roadways in several places in and around Southbury and Newtown, with some images on social media showing cars submerged up to their windshields.</p><p>Stephen Schnell, director of emergency management for the town of Southbury, said that the town was under a state of emergency, with police and fire teams dispatched for rescues and many roads closed. There were no reports of injuries or deaths as of early Sunday evening, he said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Connecticut Department of Emergency Management warned of a severe risk of flooding around Southbury into the evening. Several roads were also closed in the Danbury area.</p><p>“Please avoid flooded roadways and turn around don’t drown,” <a href="https://x.com/CTDEMHS/status/1825247478553231543" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the department urged</a> on social media.</p><p>Elizabeth Savio, 23, a team manager at Panera Bread in Southbury, said Sunday afternoon that the intersection in front of the shopping center, which includes the store, had completely flooded, and that four cars had become submerged in the floodwaters.</p><p>She said that she had watched as a man swam to one of the cars to rescue the driver, and that she had helped the two of them reach Panera. The rescuer, Lucas Barber, then swam back to the car to retrieve the man’s prosthetic leg and his golden retriever.</p><p>Mr. Barber, 30, said: “I pulled over, grabbed some rope that’s in the back of my car for emergencies, and threw my phone and wallet on the seat and ran out there.” He said he had checked the other nearby cars to ensure they were empty but had seen that Patrick Jennings, the man he rescued, was still inside his vehicle.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Jennings called him a “savior.”</p><p>“He got me all the way out of the water, the dog comes swimming up and the rest is history,” Mr. Jennings said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In Newtown, the police department was overwhelmed with calls about non-life-threatening flooding and asked residents to call only in a true emergency, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0Z5UeczxERhsSfEkcmiaCN1nj3nsaf3cLQmuKLwLrYvv8a61xB9JgGC1SizHbyNTEl&amp;id=100069267277252" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the department posted</a> on Facebook.
