Harvard is engaged in an epic battle with the White House, rooted in the administration’s claims that the university tolerates antisemitism and promotes liberal ideology.</p><p>Harvard declined on Monday to comment on the president’s post.</p><p>The university is battling the White House in federal court in Boston to secure the reinstatement of grants and contracts that the government has frozen or withdrawn, amounting to more than $3 billion. In a separate lawsuit, the university is also fighting Mr. Trump’s plan to take away the university’s right to admit international students.</p><p>It was not clear exactly what Mr. Trump meant by “foreign student lists.” The federal government, which issues visas, already has in its databases the names and countries of the approximately 6,800 international students enrolled at Harvard. The government requested the university’s disciplinary records on those students, as well as video images of student demonstrations — requests that were part of a far-reaching list of demands with which Harvard has only partially complied.</p><p>Much of the money for Harvard that the administration has frozen involves research funding for scientific studies of disease. The unit at Harvard hardest hit by Mr. Trump’s campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/harvard-chan-school-public-health-federal-funding-cuts.html" title="">has been the T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a>, where work had been underway on efforts to stop the spread of tuberculosis and to find the cause of multiple sclerosis, among other projects.</p><p>That type of research is not typically conducted at trade schools, which specialize in practical skills ranging from automotive repair to cosmetology and generally do not engage in scientific research.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jason Altmire, who heads an association of trade schools and for-profit colleges, applauded Mr. Trump’s suggestion on Monday, though he said the best thing the federal government could do to help his group’s members would be to reduce regulation of them. “President Trump has taken significant steps in this direction and we are optimistic that his announcement Monday will continue that momentum,” he said in a statement.</p><p>While campaigning for office in 2023, Mr. Trump posted a video in which he spoke of “billions and billions of dollars that we will collect by taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments” to create an entity called the American Academy.</p><p>Mr. Trump referred specifically to Harvard <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=162998363506344" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the video</a>, which resembled a sales pitch. He said the proposed new academy “will gather an entire universe of the highest quality educational content, covering the full spectrum of human knowledge and skills, and make that material available to every American citizen online for free.”</p><p>“Whether you want lectures or ancient histories or an introduction to financial accounting or training in a skilled trade, the goal will be to deliver it and get it done properly, using study groups, mentors, industry partnerships and the latest breakthrough in computing,” he said. </p><p>“It will be strictly nonpolitical,” he added, “and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed — none of that’s going to be allowed.”</p><p>No plan for such an American Academy has materialized, however, and the White House did not respond to a request last week by The New York Times for more details.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
