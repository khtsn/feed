Trump further off his game?</p><p>Would all that positive press for Ms. Harris — the big ratings, celebrity froth and the double-barreled Obama zingers — drive Mr. Trump deeper into his most self-destructive patterns?</p><p>At a Mexitalian restaurant in Las Vegas on Friday afternoon, we seemed to have our answer: It would not — at least for now.</p><p>Mr. Trump had turned up at the restaurant to stand among service industry workers and promote his “no tax on tips” policy proposal. He stayed mostly focused — he did not talk all about himself but rather about the plight of waiters and bartenders. He told them it was Ms. Harris who cast a tiebreaking vote to provide the Internal Revenue Service with funds to hire 87,000 people — the very people who would be snatching their hard-earned tips. (The truth is a <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/15/instagram-posts/no-kamala-harris-didnt-vote-in-2022-for-a-law-that/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bit more nuanced</a> than all that.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>He did not devolve into any racist tangents about Ms. Harris, or call anyone a fat pig, or pick a fight with a popular governor from his own party, or tell dark tales about young women being raped, strangled and murdered by immigrants.</p><p>He seemed almost chipper (at least more chipper than the night before, when he called into Fox News with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/trump-reaction-harris-dnc.html" title="">his initial meandering reviews</a> of Ms. Harris’s big speech). He talked about how the restaurant’s owner had started as a dishwasher and worked his way up, and joked with him about how he must have lots of cash now. The owner compared Mr. Trump to Ronald Reagan. “Thank you, Javier,” said Mr. Trump, looking touched.</p><p>He pointed out some chatty spectators and said: “I like that group over there. They’re a little bit frisky, but I like them very much.” One woman shouted that he had been right about everything. “I love that woman,” he said.</p><p>He was leaning into what is perhaps his most politically potent shtick, the whole “Apprentice” thing — that he is a rich guy who can make you a little bit richer, too. This is the stuff that can perhaps sway swing-state voters. It was a reminder that, when he is not self-destructing, he still has exceptional capabilities as a retail politician (a point that apprehensive top Democrats were making to reporters in Chicago this week).</p><p>By the early evening, he was in Glendale, Ariz., for a rally. The petulant, insult-comic version of Mr. Trump had returned. He riffed and ripped on Ms. Harris’s convention speech. Still, as these things go, he did not seem especially agitated. And he had managed to make a new friend.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had suspended his own presidential campaign a few hours earlier, appeared onstage as pyrotechnics spurted into the air and the Foo Fighters’ song “Here Comes My Hero” blared.</p><p>“We don’t agree on everything,” Mr. Kennedy said, before telling the crowd how he had been won over. He described yet another version of Mr. Trump — one that seemed less familiar. He said Mr. Trump cared about getting “the chemicals out of our food” (McDonald’s factors heavily into Mr. Trump’s own nutritional pyramid) and that he would be a champion of free speech who would end “censorship” (Mr. Trump has proposed <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3820172-trump-calls-for-jailing-journalists-who-broke-supreme-courts-draft-abortion-decision/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jailing journalists</a>).</p><p>The former president implied that, given the attempt on his life, he could commiserate with the Kennedy family. “Bobby called me to express his best wishes” after the shooting in Butler, Pa., Mr. Trump said. He promised to appoint a commission on assassination attempts (like the one on him) and release any remaining secret records about the Kennedy assassination.</p><p>They made an odd pair, and it might have seemed like a strange sideshow, one that may end up helping Mr. Trump little in the end. But every little bit counts.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s own speech announcing the suspension of his campaign on Friday was loaded with vituperative criticism of corporate media and intelligence agencies; to his supporters, that is part of Mr. Kennedy’s appeal. It is a message that dovetails neatly with Mr. Trump’s constant refrains. Erstwhile Kennedy supporters may find the transition into the MAGA fold to be an easy one.</p><p>As Mr. Kennedy finished up, Mr. Trump looked quite pleased by their newfound union.</p><p>“Wow, that was something, huh?” he said. “Fantastic guy.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
