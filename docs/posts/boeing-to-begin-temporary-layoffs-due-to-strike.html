    <h1>Boeing to Begin Temporary Layoffs Due to Strike</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Managers planned to meet with workers on Wednesday to review how the temporary furloughs, which Mr. Ortberg said would affect “a large number of U.S.-based executives, managers and employees,” would play out. He also said that he and other company leaders would take a pay cut for the rest of the strike, though he did not say by how much.</p><p>Employees will continue to receive benefits. And, for some, the temporary furloughs will be cycled in, with workers taking one week off every four weeks, on a rolling basis. It was not immediately clear which workers would be affected by the furloughs. Engineers, who are represented by a chapter of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, are still required to work during the strike.</p><p>“While this is a tough decision that impacts everybody, it is in an effort to preserve our long-term future and help us navigate through this very difficult time,” Mr. Ortberg said in his message, adding that the company would “do all we can to limit this hardship.”</p><p>Boeing announced on Monday that it would freeze hiring, limit travel and cut spending on a wide range of areas, including parts for planes made in the Seattle area. Despite the furloughs and cuts, the company said it is still prioritizing and protecting important functions, including safety, quality and customer support.</p><p>Boeing and the union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/business/boeing-strike-negotiations.html" title="">resumed negotiations</a> on Tuesday with the help of federal mediators. Union members last week resoundingly rejected the company’s latest contract offer, with many saying that the proposed raises of 25 percent over four years and other provisions were insufficient to offset the cost of living and previous concessions on retirement benefits.</p></div></div>
