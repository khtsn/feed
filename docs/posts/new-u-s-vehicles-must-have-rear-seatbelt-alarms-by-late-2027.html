    <h1>New U.S. Vehicles Must Have Rear Seatbelt Alarms by Late 2027</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will require new vehicles to sound a warning if back-seat passengers don’t use their seatbelts — a rule that will take effect in September 2027, the agency said this week.</p><p>That means more of the noisy, persistent ding familiar to drivers who start the ignition before clicking their seatbelt, and to front-seat passengers who forget to buckle up.</p><p>This new requirement, announced on Monday, is part of an update to the existing rule for seatbelt-reminder systems. Vehicles will also be required to have enhanced warnings for driver and front passenger seats, starting on Sep. 1, 2026.</p><p>Seatbelt use in back seats has consistently been lower than that in front seats, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration<em>. </em>In 2022, front seatbelt use was about 91.6 percent, while rear seatbelt use was about 81.7 percent, the agency said.</p></div></div>
