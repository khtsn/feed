Ms. Hidalgo, a member of the Socialist Party, delivered an emotional speech in which she signaled she would continue to roll out her famously aggressive policies that aim to drastically reduce the role of the automobile in Parisian life.</p><p>“I am truly angry,” she said. “The future does not belong to cars.”</p><p>An outpouring of emotion over Mr. Varry’s Oct. 15 death has put a spotlight on the dangers facing cyclists in a city that has seen an explosion in bikes and cycling lanes in recent years. But it has also underscored the frustrations that motorists increasingly feel in a place that has chosen to limit the movement, speed and parking options of cars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In recent weeks, as cycling organizations, spurred by the death of Mr. Varry, have demanded more protections from aggressive drivers, others have complained about Parisian bikers themselves, some of whom have earned a reputation as dangerous risk-takers.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters gathered to pay tribute to Paul Varry, at Place de la Madeleine in October in Paris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adnan Farzat/NurPhoto, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ratcheting up tensions this month is a new policy banning motorists from driving through the four arrondissements, or districts, in the heart of the city, rekindling the argument that Ms. Hidalgo’s anti-car stance is impractical, bad for business, and caters mostly to wealthy liberals who can afford to live in the city center.</p><p>“She is putting a garrote around Paris,” Patrick Aboukrat, a boutique owner in the fashionable Marais neighborhood, said this week, placing his hands on his neck for effect.</p><p>The debate in the French capital reflects the challenges facing policymakers around the world as they ask constituents to alter ingrained life habits in the fight against climate change. Ms. Hidalgo’s experiment — which has turned many Parisian streets into whooshing parades of pedaling commuters — is also unfolding in a city that has long harbored an innate tension between the big-city need for speed and the more languorous pleasures of “la belle vie.”</p><p>If the rest of France thinks of the stereotypical Parisian as eternally in a hurry, and perhaps a little rude along the way, it is also the place that gave rise to the 19th Century concept of the flâneur, the strolling, poetically minded observer of city life, who required time to adequately savor it. The German cultural critic Walter Benjamin even asserted, in what <a href="https://georgehbalazs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BH_1611.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may be an urban myth</a>, that some flâneurs slowed their roll by walking with a turtle on a leash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paul Varry in an undated photograph. An outpouring of emotion over his death has put a spotlight on the dangers facing cyclists in Paris.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Ms. Hidalgo, in her fiery speech last week, effectively embraced the turtle. Going “very quickly from point A to point B,” she said, “is not living in a civilized way in a city. In a city, one stops, one takes one’s time. We respect others.”</p><p>But for some Parisians, especially pedestrians, it is cyclists streaking wantonly through intersections who have become the threat. A recent <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/m-perso/article/2024/11/11/les-velos-ont-pris-le-pouvoir-sur-tous-les-autres-usagers-ils-ne-respectent-rien-la-montee-de-la-grogne-anti-cyclistes_6387630_4497916.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> in Le Monde described the rising trend of “bicycle bashing,” noting social media complaints about bikers bearing the hashtag #cyclopathe.</p><p>Ms. Hidalgo, who took office in 2014, announced this week that she would not seek a third term. She has made reducing car traffic a signature effort.</p><p>Her government has already turned roads on the banks of the Seine into walking and bike paths, created hundreds of miles of new bike lanes elsewhere, and reserved most of the Rue de Rivoli, a key east-west thoroughfare, for cyclists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The city has reduced the speed limit on Paris’s ring road and plans to remove 60,000 parking spaces by 2030. It is currently enacting a soft rollout of the new traffic restrictions in the First, Second, Third and Fourth arrondissements, on the right bank of the Seine, an area that encompasses the Louvre museum, the Tuileries gardens and neighborhoods like the Marais. Buses and taxis are exempt from the prohibition, but regular drivers must have a specific destination inside of the zone in mind.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paris’ fashionable Marais neighborhood has new traffic restrictions, which some shop owners feel will harm their businesses.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea Mantovani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In an interview last week, Mr. Aboukrat, the head of a merchants’ association called <a href="https://comitemaraisparis.fr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comité Marais Paris</a>, said his group is planning to take legal action to stop the ban, which he predicts will harm his business.</p><p>“People will look on Waze and see that it is a forbidden zone, and they won’t come,” he said, referring to the navigation app.</p><p>Yves Carra, a spokesman for the group <a href="https://www.automobile-club.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mobilité Club France</a>, until recently known as L’Automobile Club Association, said he is frustrated that the Paris government, which represents <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/8274695#:~:text=Selon%20les%20estimations%20de%20population,que%20trois%20ans%20plus%20t%C3%B4t." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 2 million people</a> within the boundaries of the city, is making decisions that affect the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20240318-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">12 million-plus people</a> who live in the metropolitan area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The car, he said, was a valid technological response to Paris’s suburban sprawl; Ms. Hidalgo’s policies, he said, was detrimental to “the people who need these cars to be able to move around and live.”</p><p>Mr. Aboukrat agreed. “It’s stunning for a Socialist mayor to stop the banlieues from coming in, or to cut off their liberty to circulate,” he said, referring to working-class suburbs.</p><p>Ms. Hidalgo, among other things, has <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/anne-hidalgo-evoque-les-attaques-trumpistes-de-la-droite-parisienne-et-laisse-planer-le-doute-sur-une-troisieme-candidature-20241110#fig-a11y-skip-main-inarticle_abo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a> that her policies have contributed to significant <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/futurs/grand-paris-la-qualite-de-lair-continue-de-sameliorer-mais-reste-mauvaise-24-04-2024-DRFCELDSDZF5FF2ATTCCPAHCUI.php#:~:text=Selon%20les%20mesures%20d&#39;Airparif,d%C3%A9sormais%20%C3%A9valu%C3%A9%20%C3%A0%205%20000." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reductions</a> in the amount of air pollution in the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A new sign reducing the speed limit to 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, per hour, being installed on Paris’s ring road.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thomas Samson/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Parisians’ love for bicycles has a long history, including what has been described as a sort of “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/fh/article-abstract/37/3/336/7246425" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fever</a>” for its precursor, the velocipede, in the 19th century. During World War II, the bicycle became the principal means of transport on Parisian streets, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/transports/tag/clement-dusong/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> Clément Dusong, a scholar of urbanism, but it fell out of favor after the war and the city began adapting to the automobile.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Varry, the cyclist who was killed, hailed from a close-in suburb, Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, where he had made the cause of cyclists “<a href="https://www.saint-ouen.fr/actualites/13-actualites/1981-communique-de-la-municipalite.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the commitment of his life</a>,” according to the City Council there.</p><p>According to the authorities,<strong> </strong>Mr. Varry was riding a bicycle in a cycling lane near La Madeleine on a Tuesday evening<strong>. </strong>The driver of the SUV, a 52-year-old man, began illegally driving in the lane as well, and at some point, ran over Mr. Varry’s foot. Mr. Varry banged his fist on the hood. Shortly thereafter, prosecutors say, the driver, whose teenage daughter was in the SUV with him, ran Mr. Varry over.</p><p>The motorist, whose name was not disclosed by prosecutors, has been detained. A lawyer for the man described him as a father of four who worked as a sales representative. He said that his client was trying to turn right, and did not run Mr. Varry over deliberately.</p><p>The incident sparked more than 200 protests across France, including one on Oct. 19 that gathered roughly 1,000 people in Paris. It has also spurred cyclists to talk about road rage they have experienced from drivers; some have even likened it to the #MeToo movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A cyclist on the banks of the Seine in Paris, opposite the Île Saint-Louis.

Ms. Hidalgo is supporting a protégé and fellow Socialist, Rémi Féraud, in the 2026 mayoral election. Mr. Féraud said he plans to continue with Ms. Hidalgo’s transportation policies.</p><p>In direct response to Mr. Varry’s death, France’s transportation minister, François Durovray, created a new “mission against violence to protect all users of the road.” This month, a pro-cycling group that Mr. Varry belonged to, Paris en Selle, or Paris in the Saddle, <a href="https://x.com/ParisEnSelle/status/1858949929063813238" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it had drawn up a list of 200 intersections and 25 major roads that they say are in urgent need of changes to make them safer.</p><p>Ms. Hidalgo said that she hoped that someplace in Paris would be named in Mr. Varry’s honor, adding him to the list of martyrs and heroes whose names already adorn the city streets.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Richard Fausset, based in Atlanta, writes about the American South, focusing on politics, culture, race, poverty and criminal justice.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/richard-fausset">More about Richard Fausset</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
