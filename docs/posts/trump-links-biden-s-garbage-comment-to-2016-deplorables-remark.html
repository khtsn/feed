Trump and his allies are trying to recreate a moment that resonated deeply with his supporters in the 2016 campaign: when Hillary Clinton referred to Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables.”</p><p>On Tuesday, it was President Biden who provided the ammunition, appearing to call Trump supporters “garbage” while talking to Latino allies by video.</p><p>“Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage,’” Mr. Biden said, adding what sounded like, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” The White House said that what Mr. Biden had said was “his supporter’s demonization,” referring only to the comic who initially insulted Puerto Ricans with an offensive joke at Mr. Trump’s New York rally on Sunday.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s allies insisted the meaning was clear.</p><p>Within minutes of the clip of Mr. Biden’s remarks going viral on social media on Tuesday night, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida addressed Mr. Trump’s rally in Allentown, Pa., and informed the crowd of Mr. Biden’s statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I have breaking news for you, Mr. President — you may not have heard this,” Mr. Rubio told the audience after Mr. Trump had called him up to the stage and stood next to him. “Just moments ago, Joe Biden stated that our supporters are garbage — are garbage.”</p><p>Mr. Rubio added, as the crowd booed and Mr. Trump shook his head: “He’s talking about the Border Patrol. He’s talking about nurses. He’s talking about teachers. He’s talking about everyday Americans who love their country and want to dream big again and support you, Mr. President.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s team saw the moment from Mr. Biden as similar to the occasion when Mrs. Clinton, speaking at a fund-raiser in late summer during the 2016 campaign, condemned half of Mr. Trump’s supporters as belonging in “what I call the basket of deplorables.” She had added, “The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic — you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.”</p><p>Mrs. Clinton went on to say the other half of his supporters felt let down and ignored by the government, but the damage had been done. Mr. Trump’s supporters proudly called themselves “deplorables,” owning the label, as the Trump campaign said it proved how little Mrs. Clinton thought of a significant chunk of the country.</p><p>The Trump campaign of 2024 immediately sought to highlight Mr. Biden’s comment, which was made far later in the race than Mrs. Clinton’s remark. Mr. Biden’s comment did not just give fodder to Mr. Trump to portray Mr. Biden as uninterested in those he represents; it gave the Trump campaign yet another opportunity to tightly tie Ms. Harris to the unpopular sitting president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“That’s terrible,” Mr. Trump said from the stage at his rally. “So you have — remember Hillary, she said ‘Deplorable.’” He added of Mr. Biden, “I’m convinced that he likes me more than he likes Kamala.”</p><p>In a post on X early Wednesday, Mr. Trump kept up the attack on Mr. Biden’s comment, <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1851481562744840576" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a>: “You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly demonized Democrats, using terms that have included “the enemy within,” “communists,” “Marxists” and “vermin.” He has attacked his critics and threatened some with prosecution if he becomes president again.</p><p>The insult of Puerto Rico at the rally on Sunday by the comic, Tony Hinchcliffe, set off backlash within the Puerto Rican community, denunciations from Republican lawmakers and now two days of negative news cycles for Mr. Trump.</p><p>Even the Trump campaign issued an uncharacteristically defensive statement distancing Mr. Trump from Mr. Hinchcliffe’s joke. And both of Mr. Trump’s events in Pennsylvania on Tuesday featured Puerto Rican women who praised Mr. Trump and portrayed him as an ally of Puerto Rico.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>By Tuesday night, the Trump campaign was using the Biden comments to appeal to his supporters. Mr. Trump sent a fund-raising email with the subject line: “You are not garbage! I love you! You are the best our nation has to offer.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, who has been the former president’s most aggressive defender, posted on X about the remark, writing: “This is disgusting. Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country. There’s no excuse for this. I hope Americans reject it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Swan is a political reporter covering the 2024 presidential election and Donald Trump’s campaign.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-swan">More about Jonathan Swan</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
