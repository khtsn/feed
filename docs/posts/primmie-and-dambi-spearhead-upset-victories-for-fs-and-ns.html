		Munchkin	</a>
</span> as its newest Controller player.</p>

<p>The series opened on Nongshim&#39;s pick of Split. Both teams went with near-mirror comps, with the Viper-Omen-Fade trio supplemented by a double-Duelist pair. While T1 went for the more conventional Yoru-Raze, Nongshim went for Yoru and Neon, a pick that is par for the course with <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/31827/dambi">
		Dambi	</a>
</span> on the squad. While putting the star Duelist on his comfort pick has paid off in the past, that did not seem to be the case on Split.</p>

<p>From the get-go, the series looked to be a strong one for T1 Duelist <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span>. On Raze, he picked up 15 kills in the opening defense half to help T1 stand strong and enter halftime tied 6-6. While Dambi struggled to get heat under his tires, BuZz and iZu were strong, combining to go 11-1 in first duels while the former went a map-best 28-11 to help T1 steal its opponents&#39; map pick 13-9.</p>

<p>The series shifted to T1&#39;s pick of Haven, Munchkin&#39;s former playground, from when he called the shots for Gen.G. Nongshim elected to start on attack, and took full advantage of having Dambi on the front foot. If BuZz was the standout on Split, it was Dambi on Haven. While the early goings on the map were close, Nongshim stayed on the front foot, kicking an 8-4 halftime lead into overdrive and playing proactive Valorant on defense to close the map 13-4.</p>


<p><em>You can&#39;t out-Neon the Neon guy. You just can&#39;t.</em></p>

<p>Similar to Split, both teams fielded similar comps on the decider map of Corrode, settling on the Omen, Viper, Fade, and Yoru. The difference came in the second Duelist, as T1 put <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> on Waylay and Dambi stayed on Neon. An early hot start saw the Ascension team claim a 4-0 lead on attack, then enter halftime up 8-4. To start the second half, Nongshim claimed its fifth pistol round of the series to inch towards the finish line, eventually claiming a 13-9 win to stay alive in the upper bracket.</p>

<p>Against stronger opposition, the Nongshim squad seemed comfortable, with in-game leader <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/488/rb">
		Rb	</a>
</span>&#39;s move to the Controller role and Xross&#39;s move to Initiator appearing seamless. Meanwhile, T1 seems to still be adjusting to life with Munchkin, with iZu shifting into the Controller role. T1 slides to the middle bracket, where a Korean derby against Gen.G awaits them, while Nongshim will play...</p>

</span> off of IGL duties, moving Initiator player <span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4678/beyn">

</span> into the middle seat.</p>

<p>The series opened on FS&#39;s pick of Pearl, and while DRX went for a Jett-Yoru, Astra-Viper comp, FULL SENSE went for an off-meta double-Duelist comp with Vyse instead of Viper. Off the bat, FULL SENSE appeared to struggle. A quick 5-0 DRX start forced IGL-turned-head coach <span data-ref-id="20">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3977/crws">
		Crws	</a>
</span> to call a timeout, and while FULL SENSE clawed back a few rounds, the scoreboard read 12-5 not too long after in the second half. <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/25255/primmie">
		primmie	</a>
</span>, on Yoru, put up his best effort with his back against the wall, dropping a game-high 31 kills to get FULL SENSE to 10 rounds, only to fall in the end 13-10.</p>

<p>Moving to DRX&#39;s pick of Pearl, the two teams seemed to change tempos. After giving up a fast start on Breeze, FULL SENSE got out to a 4-0 lead on Pearl, which eventually snowballed into an 8-2 lead. primmie continued to fry on Yoru. After ending map one +16, he continued to lead the way for his squad on both sides of the map, going 8-1 in first duels to help build serious momentum. After dropping the pistol and anti-ecos in the second half and allowing DRX to get within two rounds, FULL SENSE pulled away 13-8, with primmie dropping 25 kills and going +13.</p>

<p>The series was set to be decided on Split, the very map that FULL SENSE downed ZETA 13-2 just two days earlier. The two sides fielded similar comps, with FULL SENSE sticking with its Omen, Viper, Yoru, Raze, and Fade comp. The only difference for DRX&#39;s comp was <span data-ref-id="22">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/28400/hyunmin">
		HYUNMIN	</a>
</span> on Neon in place of Raze. After picking up four straight to start Pearl, FS did the same on Split, opening with four straight rounds to force an early timeout from <span data-ref-id="23">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/775/termi">
		termi	</a>
</span>. After claiming a 6-1 lead, FULL SENSE&#39;s grip on the game faltered a bit, as DRX clawed a few rounds back to end the first half down just 7-5, and claimed a pistol to tie things up 7-7 soon after.</p>

<p>With FULL SENSE defending and DRX attacking, the map became the latter chasing the former. With primmie chasing <span data-ref-id="24">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8480/aspas">
		aspas	</a>
</span>&#39;s BO3 kill record, FULL SENSE looked unstoppable. DRX tying the score at 7 apiece was the closest they would ever get on Split, as clean protocol and flicky shots got FULL SENSE to a 13-8 win to close the series out.</p>

<p><em>No kill record for primmie, but the series is claimed and FULL SENSE moves on.</em></p>

<p>primmie&#39;s 79 kills left him three short of tying aspas&#39;s global record of 82, but set a new record in VCT Pacific. His effort was paramount for his side, as no other FULL SENSE player had more than 50 kills in the series. For DRX, <span data-ref-id="25">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1916/free1ng">
		free1ng	</a>
</span> showed flashes as a strong anchor, notching a joint-team-high 54 kills and a 1.19 rating, while MaKo showed flashes of his pre-IGL self with 54 of his own.</p>

<p>FULL SENSE moves on to play Nongshim RedForce, while DRX slides to the middle bracket to play <span data-ref-id="26">
