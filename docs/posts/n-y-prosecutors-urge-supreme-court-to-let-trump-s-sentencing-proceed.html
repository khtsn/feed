Trump’s last-ditch effort to halt his criminal sentencing</a>, in a prelude to a much-anticipated ruling that will determine whether he enters the White House as a felon.</p><p>In a filing a day before the scheduled sentencing, prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney’s office characterized Mr. Trump’s emergency application to the Supreme Court as premature, noting that he had not yet exhausted his state court appeals.</p><p>The prosecutors, who secured Mr. Trump’s conviction last year on charges that he falsified records to cover up a sex scandal that endangered his 2016 presidential campaign, implored the Supreme Court to let the sentencing proceed.</p><p>“There is no basis for such intervention,” the prosecutors wrote. “There is a compelling public interest in proceeding to sentencing,” they added, and emphasized that “the sanctity of a jury verdict and the deference that must be accorded to it are bedrock principles in our Nation’s jurisprudence.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After a series of unsuccessful maneuvers in New York State courts, Mr. Trump’s fate rests in the hands of a friendlier audience: a Supreme Court with a 6-to-3 conservative majority that includes three justices Mr. Trump appointed. Five are needed to grant a stay.</p><p>Their decision, coming little more than a week before the inauguration, will test the influence Mr. Trump wields over a court that has previously appeared sympathetic to his legal troubles. In July, the court granted former presidents broad immunity for official acts, stymying a federal criminal case against Mr. Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election. (After Mr. Trump won the 2024 election, prosecutors shut down that case.)</p><p>The revelation that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/justice-alito-trump.html" title="">Mr. Trump spoke this week by phone with one of the conservative justices</a>, Samuel A. Alito Jr., has fueled concerns that he has undue sway over the court.</p><p>Justice Alito said he was delivering a job reference for a former law clerk whom Mr. Trump was considering for a government position. But the disclosure alarmed ethics groups and raised questions about why a president-elect would personally handle such a routine reference check.</p><p>It is unclear whether Justice Alito will recuse himself from the decision, which the court could issue promptly. Earlier Thursday, the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, declined to grant a separate request from Mr. Trump to freeze the sentencing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The proceeding is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. Friday in the same Lower Manhattan courtroom where Mr. Trump’s trial took place last spring, when the jury convicted him on all 34 felony counts.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, writing about public corruption.
