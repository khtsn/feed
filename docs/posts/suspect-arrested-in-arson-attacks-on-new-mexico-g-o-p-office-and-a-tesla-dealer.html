Investigators said that he had scrawled the phrases “Die Elon,” “Tesla Nazi Inc” and “Die Tesla Nazi,” references to the company’s billionaire founder, Elon Musk, who is leading the Trump administration’s cost-cutting program. Mr. Wagner was then observed breaking some car windows and throwing an incendiary device inside one of them, destroying it, a criminal complaint said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damage from a fire at the Republican Party of New Mexico’s headquarters in Albuquerque in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">New Mexico G.O.P.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Investigators say that he left behind critical evidence each time, connecting him to both crimes: lids from a jar of Smucker’s jelly and a container of olives that they said he had filled with gasoline. Both lids had the letter “H” or “I” written on them with what appeared to be a marker, photographs showed.</p><p>“Hurling firebombs is not political protest,” Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said in a statement on Monday. “It is a dangerous felony that we will prosecute to the maximum extent.”</p><p>A federal public defender for Mr. Wagner, who remains in custody, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.</p><p>Mr. Wagner was charged with two counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives, according to court records. He could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>According to the Justice Department, Mr. Wagner was seen in security camera footage carrying out the arson attack at the Tesla dealership and was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt. At one point, investigators said, his hood fell back, giving them a better look at him.</p><p>During a search of Mr. Wagner’s home on Friday, the authorities said, a black hoodie with red spray paint was found on it. A stencil with the letters “ICE = KKK,” which had been painted on the Republican Party headquarters, was also found, along with a box containing empty jars like the ones that were found at both crime scenes.</p><p>Federal authorities said that his arrest underscored a push to crack down on what the Justice Department calls “domestic terrorism,” including vandalism and acts of violence targeting the president’s political and corporate allies. Much of that ire has been directed at Mr. Musk and his companies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/business/elon-musk-tesla-violence-protests-vandalism.html" title="">particularly Tesla</a>.</p><p>From Oregon to Massachusetts, charging stations have been set ablaze, vehicles scrawled with graffiti and dealership windows shot out.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neil Vigdor covers breaking news for The Times, with a focus on politics.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
