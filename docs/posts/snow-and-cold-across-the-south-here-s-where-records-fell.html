The readings from the recent storm, which Mr. Mugrage called reliable, mainly came from volunteer observers trained by the Weather Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The record will not be finalized until a meeting is held with the State Climate Extreme Committee, which evaluates meteorological observations. “It has to go through a full process to be listed as the official record,” Mr. Mugrage said.</p><p>There has been a flurry of chatter about records ever since the storm dumped snow in areas of the South that usually don’t see it.</p><p>About 20 miles southwest of Milton, the weather station at the Pensacola International Airport measured 7.6 inches in the storm, surpassing its snow event record of three inches set in 1895. This breaks the old state record but not the new one set in Milton.</p><p>Just west of Florida, at the Weather Service office in Mobile, Ala, 7.5 inches of snow was recorded, breaking the past event record of six inches in 1895.</p><p>“I&#39;m not exactly familiar with what happened in 1895, but I imagine it’s not too dissimilar to what we just had,” Mr. Mugrage said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In Louisiana, which saw its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/louisiana-snow-blizzard-i10-road-closure.html#:~:text=A%20rare%20winter%20storm%20brought%20record%20snowfall%20to%20the%20state%20on%20Tuesday.&amp;text=The%20authorities%20in%20Louisiana%20on,state&#39;s%20first%2Dever%20blizzard%20warning." title="">first-ever blizzard warning</a>, at least one record was shattered in New Orleans. On Tuesday, eight inches was recorded at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, where the Weather Service has monitored an official weather station since 1948.
