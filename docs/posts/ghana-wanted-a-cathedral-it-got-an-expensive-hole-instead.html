Last month, the government announced it would no longer fund the project and dissolved the agency responsible for managing it.</p><p>Africa is home to the world’s largest Christian population. Ghana, where faith is especially important to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/12/21/key-findings-from-the-global-religious-futures-project/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">young people</a>, has seen a recent boom in church building.</p><p>But the national cathedral project never attracted the support Mr. Akufo-Addo anticipated. Instead, construction stalled at its foundations as Ghana suffered its worst economic crisis in a generation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A church service in Accra last month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>To many Ghanaians lately, a cathedral has seemed like the last thing the country needs, especially one with an estimated cost of $400 million.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The project began with much fanfare. In 2019, at a fund-raising dinner in Washington, a smiling Mr. Akufo-Addo cut into a large gray, square confection — the planned cathedral <a href="https://npp-usa.org/fundraising-event-for-the-construction-of-the-national-cathedral-of-ghana-held-in-washington-dc/#jp-carousel-2960" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rendered in cake</a>. With a 5,000-seat auditorium and a concave roof referencing the curve of Asante royal stools, it was intended to be much more than just a cathedral. It was to be a national monument, similar to the Washington National Cathedral or London’s Westminster Cathedral. A place where the solemn ceremonies of state — like presidents’ funerals and royal weddings — would take place.</p><p>Mr. Akufo-Addo, who was born into a Presbyterian family but became an Anglican as a young man, told the group gathered in Washington that the interdenominational cathedral would be a unifier for Ghanaian Christians, who represent more than 70 percent of the population. It would also be an offering of thanks to God for sparing the country from the epidemics, civil wars and famines that had plagued its neighbors, he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.ghanamissionun.org/president-akufo-addo-calls-for-support-to-build-national-cathedral/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">But then he revealed</a> a third reason for its construction.</p><p>“I made a pledge to God that if I become the president — after two unsuccessful attempts — in the 2016 presidential elections, I will build a cathedral to the glory of God,” he said, according to official readouts of the event.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana last month in his home office. “I find it difficult to see what is so problematic about it,” he said of the cathedral project.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The statement turned out to be a gift to Mr. Akufo-Addo’s opponents, who argued that the president should not be allowed to use public money as part of a personal bargain he made with God — let alone $58 million of it.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Paul Opoku-Mensah, the executive director of the agency overseeing the project, said that demonizing the cathedral quickly became “a political strategy.”</p><p>In March 2024, one member of Parliament, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, led a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LijE1pAecVk&amp;ab_channel=GHOneTV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">march</a> to the construction site, cutting a red ribbon at its gate to poke fun at the president for commissioning what was still a giant hole.</p><p>“We are demanding that the contracts must be immediately terminated to avoid further financial loss to the state,” he said.</p><p>If using the cathedral to target the president was a political strategy, it worked. John Mahama, a former president who promised to create jobs and fix the economy, pulled off a dramatic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/africa/ghana-presidential-election.html" title="">comeback</a> in December’s election. He made Mr. Okudzeto Ablakwa his foreign minister.</p><p>Corruption accusations often take center stage in Ghanaian elections, and the large sums involved in the national cathedral project convinced many Ghanaians that officials had been skimming off the top. A public ombudsman said procurement rules had been breached and <a href="https://chraj.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/National-Cathedral-Decision.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommended</a> a forensic audit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>But in an interview by the big hole in early April, Mr. Opoku-Mensah said he had nothing to hide and had handed over all the accounts to the investigators.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A meeting room at the cathedral project site.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>He explained that the cathedral was not really intended as a church, but as a major monument that had needed state money to get started but would eventually become a profit-making magnet for visitors.</p><p>“It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of the vision,” he said. </p><p>Mr. Akufo-Addo also seemed befuddled about the controversy. “I find it difficult to see what is so problematic about it,” he said in an interview in April in his book-lined home office surrounded by a lush garden. He mused aloud about whether people believed it “would be too big a tribute to my leadership.”</p><p>Now that the country’s leaders have changed, few Ghanaians admit to supporting the cathedral. Those who do say Mr. Akufo-Addo and others should foot the bill — but not taxpayers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“It should be funded through donations,” said Esi Darko, an architect, as she left church one recent afternoon in an Accra neighborhood known as Christian Village. “It shouldn’t be imposed upon everyone because not all are Christians.”</p><p>There are also around five million Muslims in Ghana, a country of more than 35 million people, and, lately, a growing number of atheists.</p><p>“Don’t believe in God?” reads a <a href="https://ffrf.org/news/releases/first-ever-atheist-billboard-in-africa-unveiled-in-ghana-with-ffrf-support/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">billboard</a> in central Accra. “You are not alone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lawrence Tetteh, a Ghanaian pastor, delivering a sermon at the Fountain of Life Mission Church in Accra.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Even prominent Christians have soured on the project. Arriving at the church he leads on a recent Sunday, one well-known pastor, Lawrence Tetteh, and his sister Lady Gifty Tetteh, a British Ghanaian barrister, ducked into Mr. Tetteh’s office for an interview.</p><p>He embraced the cathedral project initially, he said. He thought Christians from different denominations would be brought together by it, just as Ghanaian Muslims are by the <a href="https://www.ghananationalmosque.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national mosque</a>, built by Turkey in 2021. But when he saw so much state money being spent, Mr. Tetteh said, he stopped supporting the idea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“We are a developing nation,” he said. “As much as it’s nice to have an edifice, we also don’t want a situation where our edifice will eat into the little the nation has to live on.”</p><p>Ms. Tetteh said that God would understand if the president explained that he could not make good on his cathedral promise. “God is not a hard taskmaster,” she said. Perhaps, she suggested, the former president could build him a little prayer room instead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The entrance to the construction site.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>Francis Kokutse contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ruth Maclean is the West Africa bureau chief for The Times, covering 25 countries including Nigeria, Congo, the countries in the Sahel region as well as Central Africa.</p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
