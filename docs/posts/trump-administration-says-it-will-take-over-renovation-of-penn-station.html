    <h1>Trump Administration Says It Will Take Over Renovation of Penn Station</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The federal transportation department said the move would save $120 million by putting Amtrak in charge of a master plan for renovation and possible expansion. One of the biggest hurdles to renovating the train hall has been the structure that sits atop the station: Madison Square Garden, the famous sports arena whose owners have bristled at the thought of moving or disturbing the venue.</p><p>Mr. Trump has the ultimate say over the station because it is owned by Amtrak, a corporation controlled by the federal government. Members of its board of directors are presidential appointees. All of the current directors were appointed by Joe Biden, except the chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, who was appointed by Barack Obama.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the White House pressured Amtrakâ€™s chief executive, Stephen Gardner, to resign because of his ties to the Biden administration. Mr. Gardner has not been replaced.</p><p>The M.T.A. did not receive an advance copy of the letter and was caught off guard by the announcement. Amtrak officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
