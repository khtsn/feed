But the competing priorities of local, state and federal stakeholders have made progress difficult.</p><p>It was not immediately clear what the administration’s vision for Penn Station might look like. Nor was it known whether the administration supports one of the various proposals for renovating or expanding the station. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The federal transportation department said the move would save $120 million by putting Amtrak in charge of a master plan for renovation and possible expansion. One of the biggest hurdles to renovating the train hall has been the structure that sits atop the station: Madison Square Garden, the famous sports arena whose owners have bristled at the thought of moving or disturbing the venue.</p><p>Mr. Trump has the ultimate say over the station because it is owned by Amtrak, a corporation controlled by the federal government. Members of its board of directors are presidential appointees. All of the current directors were appointed by Joe Biden, except the chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, who was appointed by Barack Obama.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the White House pressured Amtrak’s chief executive, Stephen Gardner, to resign because of his ties to the Biden administration. Mr. Gardner has not been replaced.</p><p>The M.T.A. did not receive an advance copy of the letter and was caught off guard by the announcement. Amtrak officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stefanos Chen is a Times reporter covering New York City’s transit system.</p></div><div><p>Patrick McGeehan is a Times reporter who covers the economy of New York City and its airports and other transportation hubs.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Iran Nuclear Talks</strong><strong>: </strong>As the administration grapples with how to stop Iran’s nuclear program, it has so far left a trail of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html">mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Housing Aid:</strong> The White House is considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/housing-aid-hud-federal-budget.html">deep cuts to federal housing programs</a>, including a sweeping overhaul of aid to low-income families, in a reconfiguration that could jeopardize millions of Americans’ access to rental assistance funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standoff Over Transgender Athletes:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-sues-maine-trans-athletes-womens-sports.html">sued Maine</a> over policies that allow some transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports, just days after also threatening to cut off funding to the state’s public schools and lunch programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disinformation Office Shuttered:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio shut down a State Department office that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-rubio-state-department-foreign-disinformation.html">tracks and counters global disinformation</a>, including campaigns by rival powers of the United States and terrorist groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Deals With Law Firms:</strong> To avoid retribution, some of the nation’s biggest law firms agreed to deals with President Trump to provide free legal services for uncontroversial causes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html">Now he wants more from them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Changing Briefing Room: </strong>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/15/us/trump-white-house-briefing-room-new-media.html">the seating chart in the White House press briefing room has been controlled</a> by an independent organization.
