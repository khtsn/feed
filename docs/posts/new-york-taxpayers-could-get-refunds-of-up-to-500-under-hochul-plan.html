Kathy Hochul of New York on Monday proposed sending $3 billion in “inflation refund” checks to most taxpayers.</p><p>The plan, the first in a series of proposals that the governor typically rolls out in advance of her State of the State address in January, would benefit roughly 8.6 million people, including about 3.6 million in New York City.</p><p>Ms. Hochul said the suggested refund will be part of next year’s budget proposal, with the money coming from higher-than-expected sales tax revenue because of higher prices.</p><p>If the proposal is adopted as part of next year’s budget, residents who file their taxes jointly and make less than $300,000 would receive $500 checks, while individuals making up to $150,000 would receive $300. The governor said she expected residents to receive the refunds next fall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I am sure there are some elected officials or some special interest groups who will weigh in and say, ‘I know how that extra money should be spent,’” Ms. Hochul said during the announcement at Co-op City in the Bronx. “But here is my message: I’m on your side. I believe that this extra inflation-driven sales tax revenue should not be spent by the state. It is your money, and it should be back in your pockets.”</p><p>Legislative leaders appeared receptive to the proposal. Mike Whyland, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, said Assembly Democrats are eager to tackle questions surrounding affordability, whether it be housing costs or food prices.</p><p>“Proposals like this are a good first step,” Mr. Whyland said in a statement. “We look forward to discussing this and other ideas in the coming session to help middle-class and working New Yorkers.”</p><p>The proposal comes about a month after a tough election cycle for Democrats, in which voters regularly cited the economy and rising food and housing costs as the reason they were supporting Republicans.</p><p>Democrats fared better in tight congressional races in New York State, but the party still lost control of the Senate. Ms. Hochul <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/nyregion/hochul-democrats-house-election.html" title="">was instrumental</a> in raising money and creating an organization to support candidates running in New York’s congressional districts. In post-mortems seeking to make sense of their losses, some Democrats said not enough attention had been paid to basic concerns about the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“People came up to me and they talked about their problems,” said George Latimer, the Westchester County executive who won election to the House in November and <a href="https://myrye.com/2024/11/latimer-submits-formal-resignation-as-county-boss-as-he-heads-to-congress/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will take office</a> next month. “They didn’t talk about the national G.D.P.<em>”</em></p><p>Ms. Hochul faces her own electoral challenges, with rivals from both political parities readying to challenge her in the 2026 primary and general election. An August poll from Siena College revealed that only a third of New Yorkers had favorable impressions of her.</p><p>One potential primary opponent, Representative Ritchie Torres, <a href="https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1866144915593335294" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that the “one-time check will not compensate for the double-digit increases in inflation that New Yorkers have suffered.” He also criticized the governor for bringing back congestion pricing on vehicles entering parts of New York City; Ms. Hochul had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/nyregion/hochul-congestion-pricing-lawsuits.html" title="">halted the $15 fee</a> in June, only to reinstitute it at $9 last month. It is scheduled to go into effect in January.</p><p>Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said the surplus funds and proceeds from a good economy would have been better spent on reining in costs of government, improving services or even simply saving the money for an unforeseen crisis. In September, the New York State comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, reported that the state’s general fund operating surplus was about $7.4 billion.</p><p>Politicians listen to their constituents, Mr. Rein said. That becomes a concern when “politicians kick the budgetary can down the road, and then we get into ourselves into real trouble, and the problems are much harder to solve.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit tax policy group, said that while the governor’s idea might be good politics, it is probably bad policy. “One-time tax rebates have very little benefit to the overall economy. They do not change incentives around working or investing and they do not have a long-term effect on economic decision making,” he said.</p><p>Ms. Hochul seemed to acknowledge the proposal’s short-term benefits. When asked by reporters why she did not devote this money toward capital improvements for the New York City subway. Ms. Hochul said she wanted New Yorkers who live across the state to benefit from the surplus revenue.</p><p>“This is for people to know that there is money back in their pockets,” she said, adding that people could use it for commuting costs, to pay doctors’ bills or buy groceries. “Know that it’s going to be there for the next holiday season,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Politics in the New York Region</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Eric Adams, Republican?:</strong> With his political future in doubt, Eric Adams, the Democratic mayor of New York City, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/nyregion/eric-adams-republican.html">has opened the door to returning to the Republican Party</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan for New Homes: </strong>The New York City Council <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/nyc-housing-city-of-yes.html">approved an ambitious plan</a> that could make way for 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years, the most significant effort to address the city’s housing crisis in decades.</p></li><li><p><strong>N.Y.C.
