Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Russia’s slowing growth and rising inflation, economists say, show that the sanctions are having an impact, putting a dent in the stimulating effect that the Kremlin’s enormous wartime spending has had on the economy, they say.</p><p>Civilian companies are particularly feeling the pinch.

The report was interpreted by some as a sign of Ms. Nabiullina’s waning support from Mr. Putin.</p><p>Another attack came from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, a pro-government association of large companies known by its Russian acronym, R.S.P.P.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The <a href="https://rspp.ru/activity/analytics/sostoyanie-rossiyskoy-ekonomiki-i-deyatelnost-kompaniy-rezultaty-monitoringa-rspp-vo-iii-kvarrtale-20/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organization said</a> that 36 percent of its members had reported being unable to collect payments from clients in the third quarter of this year, up 14 percentage points from a year ago.

The slowdown was particularly pronounced in sectors without direct connection to the military, such as education, construction, and oil and gas production.</p><p>“The only things that grow at meaningful rate are those related to war,” said Mr. Kolyandr.</p><p>The warning signs are flashing elsewhere.</p><p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2725" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New American sanctions</a> on Russian banks in November have contributed to a large decline in the value of the ruble.

Wages continue outstripping inflation, raising the standard of living of ordinary Russians and denting the impact of the slowdown on the population, according to the Center for Analysis and Strategies in Europe, or CASE, a Cyprus-based group of opposition Russian economists.</p><p>Real wages in Russia grew nearly 18 percent since the start of the war, reversing a seven-year decline, <a href="https://case-center.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/case-241112-en_fin2_compressed.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the economists said in a recent report</a>.</p><p>Inflation, although stubborn, remains in the single digits, and the Kremlin maintains ample means to finance the war, the CASE economists said. The Russian government is raising taxes on companies and wealthy individuals and is tapping into its sovereign wealth fund. The government’s low debt burden — about 18 percent of economic output — means it has ample room to keep borrowing from Russian banks.</p><p>The battle over Russian interest rates underlines longer-term economic tensions, said Ms. Prokopenko.</p><p>The Kremlin’s seemingly endless war has persuaded Russian business elites to seek short-term profit in an overheated economy over long-term investment. The growing calls for cheap money now threaten to dismantle a system of economic checks and balances that have kept the Russian economy stable over most of Mr. Putin’s rule, Ms. Prokopenko added.</p><p>“If a warring nation can’t present to its people an idea of a bright future, then it makes sense to stuff yourself while the party lasts,” she said. “You may not have that chance later.”</p><p>Oleg Matsnev<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anatoly Kurmanaev covers Russia and its transformation following the invasion of Ukraine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anatoly-kurmanaev">More about Anatoly Kurmanaev</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/central-bank-of-russia">Central Bank of Russia</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/elvira-nabiullina">Elvira Nabiullina</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/02/world/europe/russia-economy-war-ukraine.html">96</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Russia Forges Ahead:</strong> Russian troops in eastern Ukraine have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/europe/russia-advances-eastern-ukraine.html">seized at least 10 villages and settlements</a> in recent days, as Moscow presses on with slow but steady advances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Policing in Wartime Ukraine: </strong>For Volodymyr Nikulin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/europe/ukraine-donbas-wartime-policing.html">being a cop in Ukraine</a> means aiding evacuees and tackling looters.
