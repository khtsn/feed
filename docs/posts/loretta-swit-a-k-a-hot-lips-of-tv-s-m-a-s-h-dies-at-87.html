Margaret Houlihan human, dignified and, against all odds, sympathetic on the acclaimed television series “M*A*S*H,” died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87<em>. </em></p><p>Her death was announced by her publicist, Harlan Boll.</p><p>In the Oscar-winning 1970 film “M*A*S*H,” directed by Robert Altman, Major Houlihan (whose blatantly sexist nickname was Hot Lips) was played by Sally Kellerman. When the movie became a CBS series, Ms. Swit stepped into the role and made it her own, adding heretofore unseen nuance. She was nominated 10 years in a row for the Emmy Award for best supporting actress in a comedy series, and she won twice, in 1980 and 1982.</p><p>“M*A*S*H,” which aired from 1972 through 1983 on CBS, was, like the movie that inspired it, set at a mobile Army hospital during the Korean War. Major Houlihan spent the first five seasons distracted by her open secret of an affair with the sniveling, very married Maj. Frank Burns (Larry Linville).</p><p>Around the time Major Burns returned to the United States, she married a handsome officer whom she had met in Tokyo. But he proved unfaithful, and she was soon divorced and newly dedicated to her career as the unit’s head nurse. To reflect these changes, her character’s name was officially changed from Hot Lips to Margaret.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It was the greatest time in my career,” Ms. Swit told the British newspaper <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/dec/17/artsfeatures" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> in 2001. Margaret’s ambition throughout the series was to be “the best damned nurse in Korea, and that motivated everything I did, even when it came to sex.” Major Houlihan did seem to be on a flirtatious first-name basis with every general who visited the camp.</p><p>As early as Season 2, her nemesis, Capt. Benjamin Franklin Pierce (Alan Alda) — better known as Hawkeye — saw her good side, referring to her as “nurse, friend and all-around good egg.” Col. Sherman T. Potter (Harry Morgan) called her “the finest nurse I’ve ever scrubbed with.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Swit with other members of the “M*A*S*H” cast, from left: Larry Linville, Wayne Rogers, Alan Alda (seated front), Gary Burghoff and McLean Stevenson. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false"> CBS Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The character only grew in perceived stature as the seasons passed, wrestling violent patients into submission and performing triage in her wedding dress.</p><p>Ms. Swit firmly believed that “if you’ve got a long-run series, then there’s always got to be room for growth,” she told <a href="https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stage/the-big-interview-loretta-swit/article_af18b674-659a-5bbb-b454-456f8a9c8a69.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20guys%20in%20control%20would,be%20just%20the%20right%20place.%E2%80%9D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Toronto Star in 2010</a>. “Of all the places you’d be inclined to grow, I certainly think somewhere you’re in danger every day and healing people every day would be just the right place.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The show explored Major Houlihan’s feelings about her proud military heritage, as the daughter of a general who would have preferred a son. And it looked in on the night of passion — under enemy fire — that she and Captain Pierce shared and, as soon as the morning-after dust settled, never spoke of again.</p><p>Loretta Jane Szwed was born on Nov. 4, 1937, in Passaic, N.J., to Lester Szwed, a salesman, and Nellie (Kassack) Szwed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Swit at her home in 1971.

She was the understudy for the lead female role in the national tour of the romantic comedy “Any Wednesday.”</p><p>She also appeared onstage in the musical “Mame,” in the comic role of Agnes Gooch, the lead character’s mousy secretary-nanny, who bursts out of her sheltered existence and comes home pregnant.

She appeared in the television movies “Race With the Devil” (1975), “Mirror, Mirror” (1979), “The Love Tapes” (1980) and “Games Mother Never Taught You” (1982).
