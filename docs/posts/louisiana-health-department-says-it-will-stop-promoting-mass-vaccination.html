Abraham, Louisiana’s surgeon general, wrote in the memo that the state would “encourage each patient to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their provider” but would “no longer promote mass vaccination.”</p><p>The letter came on a day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/rfk-jr-hhs-senate-confirmation.html" title="">when the U.S. Senate confirmed</a> Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised questions about vaccines, as the new U.S. health secretary.
