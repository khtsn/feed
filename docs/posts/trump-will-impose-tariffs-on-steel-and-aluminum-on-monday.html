Canada is also a major supplier of aluminum to the United States, followed distantly by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and China.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on metals is not new. In his first term, the president levied tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum globally, angering allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union. He ultimately rolled back some of those barriers on Canada and Mexico when they signed a revised trade agreement with the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Biden administration later reached agreements with the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan to roll back some of their trade restrictions. A handful of other countries also negotiated quotas or other arrangements, but for most countries the steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It’s not clear if the new tariffs would be added to the old ones.</p><p>Both of Mr. Trump’s new tariff proposals would broaden his trade fight to many different countries, setting off trade spats that could encourage other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs on American goods.</p><p>Mr. Trump has already rocked diplomatic and economic relationships over the past week with almost-daily tariff threats.</p><p>The reciprocal tariffs the president has proposed would raise the levies the United States charges on certain imports to match what other countries charge on American products when those goods come across their borders. They could be used by the president as a lever to seek further concessions in negotiations. But they would also violate U.S. commitments to the World Trade Organization.</p><p>The president said his reciprocal tariffs would be announced on Tuesday or Wednesday at a news conference, and the tariffs would go into effect “almost immediately” on every country.</p><p>“Very simply, if they charge us, we charge them,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
