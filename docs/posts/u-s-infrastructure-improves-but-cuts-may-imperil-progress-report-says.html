Most infrastructure, including aviation, waterways and schools, earned a C or D grade; ports and rail did better. The group also projected a $3.7 trillion infrastructure funding shortfall over the next decade.</p><p>“The report card demonstrates the crucial need for the new administration and Congress to continue sustained investment in infrastructure,” Darren Olson, the chairman of the society’s committee on America’s infrastructure, said on a call with reporters. “Better infrastructure is an efficient investment of taxpayer dollars that results in a stronger economy and prioritizes American jobs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The report, which is now released every four years, has long noted that the United States spends too little on infrastructure. But that started to change in 2021, the group said, thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which authorized $1.2 trillion in funding under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. That investment is showing results, with grades having improved since the last report, in 2021, for nearly half the 18 categories that the group tracks.</p><p>But in January, Mr. Trump froze much of the funding under that law and another aimed at addressing climate change, pending a review by his agencies. That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/climate/trumps-funding-freeze-raises-a-new-question-is-the-governments-word-good.html" title="">halted a variety of programs</a>, including those intended to help schools, farmers and small businesses.</p><p>The engineering group expressed optimism that the federal spending would ultimately continue because it benefited most Americans and enjoyed bipartisan support.</p><p>“The investment levels that we saw under the last administration have really started to move the needle, and we’re looking forward to advancing that conversation as we move into this administration,” said Kristina Swallow, a former president of the group.</p><p>The nation’s ports received the highest grade of any form of infrastructure, a B, indicating that they are generally safe, reliable and in good condition. Rail received a B–, a decline from its B in 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Bridges, broadband, drinking water systems, hazardous waste treatment, inland waterways, public parks and solid waste received grades of C+, C or C–, reserved for infrastructure that is in mediocre condition and needs attention. Dams, levees, roads, schools and infrastructure for aviation, energy, storm water, transit and wastewater received grades of D+ or D, indicating that they are in poor condition.</p><p>Some aviation infrastructure is widely considered outdated, and the Federal Aviation Administration has faced a shortage of air traffic controllers for years. Energy was the only category besides rail that received a declining grade, to D+. The group said power plants and other sources of electricity had failed to keep up with rising demand from electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.</p><p>“Each data center uses the same amount of energy needed to power 80,000 homes,” said Otto Lynch, an engineer who led the energy chapter of the report. “Our generation capacity has remained stagnant as new sources are merely replacing sources like coal that have been retired in recent years.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/niraj-chokshi">More about Niraj Chokshi</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Musk Effect:</strong> Elon Musk is seemingly everywhere, dominating the news out of Washington and beyond.
