Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in August that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">Google had broken antitrust laws</a> to maintain its dominance in online search. He is now hearing arguments from the government and the company over how to best fix Google’s monopoly and is expected to order those measures, referred to as “remedies,” by the end of the summer.</p><p>In an opening statement in the hearing on Monday, the government said Judge Mehta should force Google to sell its popular Chrome web browser, which drives users to its search engine. Government lawyers also said the company should take steps to give competitors a leg up if the court wants to restore competition to the moribund market for online search.</p><p>“Your honor, we are not here for a Pyrrhic victory,” David Dahlquist, a Justice Department lawyer, said in his opening statement. “This is the time for the court to tell Google and all other monopolists who are out there listening, and they are listening, that there are consequences when you break the antitrust laws.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The outcome in the case, U.S. v. Google, could drastically change the Silicon Valley behemoth. Google faces mounting challenges, including a breakup of its ad technology business after a different federal judge ruled last week that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/technology/google-ad-tech-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">company held a monopoly</a> over some of the tools that websites use to sell open ad space. In 2023, Google also lost an antitrust suit brought by the maker of the video game Fortnite, which accused the tech giant of violating competition laws with its Play app store.</p><p>The legal troubles could hurt Google as it battles OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta to lead a new era of artificial intelligence. Google has increasingly woven A.I. into its search. But the Justice Department has told Judge Mehta he should make sure Google cannot parlay its search monopoly into similar dominance in A.I.</p><p>The Justice Department’s actions signal that the Trump administration plans to maintain government scrutiny of the tech industry. Apple, Meta and Amazon also face antitrust lawsuits from the U.S. government, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/meta-antitrust-trial-mark-zuckerberg.html" title="">Meta</a> in the second week of a trial over whether it illegally stifled competition by buying Instagram and WhatsApp when they were young companies.</p><p>The case over Google search was filed in 2020, under the first Trump administration. In 2023, Judge Mehta oversaw an eight-week trial in which the government argued that Google had subverted competition by striking deals to be the preselected search engine in web browsers and on the home screens of smartphones. The company paid $26.3 billion to companies like Apple and Samsung as part of those deals in 2021.</p><p>The government said those deals locked in Google’s control, putting its search engine in front of consumers looking for information, which gave the company more data to improve its search engine. That then attracted more consumers, entrenching the company’s dominance, the government said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Google countered that consumers chose its search product simply because it was better than competitors like Microsoft’s Bing and DuckDuckGo. The company also said it invested constantly to make its search engine the best.</p><p>Judge Mehta ultimately sided with the government. That kicked off a process to determine how to fix the competitive issues caused by Google’s monopoly.</p><p>Google has told the judge that little needs to change. It said it should still be allowed to pay for prime placement for its search engine in web browsers and on smartphones. But it said that some of those deals should be open for renegotiation every year and that companies should be allowed to choose a different preselected search engine for products like a private browsing mode.</p><p>The Justice Department has asked for wider changes that would restrict Google’s ability to reach users and give its competitors resources to compete with its search engine. It wants Judge Mehta to stop the company from making payments to browser makers and smartphone manufacturers to give its search engine prime placement.</p><p>It has also asked Judge Mehta to preserve the ability to force Google to sell Android, its smartphone operating system, if the remedies do not restore competition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Chrome is a significant gateway to search,” said Mr. Dahlquist, adding that billions of dollars in search revenue flows through the widely used browser. “The divestiture of Chrome, when finalized, will give rivals access to a significant number of search queries to help compete with Google.”</p><p>The government has also asked Judge Mehta to force Google to syndicate its search results and ads feed to its competitors, as well as provide other search engines with additional data they could use to improve their products.</p><p>Mr. Dahlquist said the judge must ensure Google cannot use its search monopoly to gain control of the market for A.I. and said the company was already taking steps to ensure the dominance of one of its marquee A.I. products, its Gemini chatbot.</p><p>“This court’s remedy should be forward looking and not ignore what’s on the horizon,” he said. “Google is using the same strategy that they did for search and now applying it to Gemini.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David McCabe is a Times reporter who covers the complex legal and policy issues created by the digital economy and new technologies.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
