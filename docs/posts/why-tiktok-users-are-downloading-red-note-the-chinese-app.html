A video of Ms. Lee dancing and doing the dishes — while wearing her sleeping baby — has been watched more than one million times since November.</p><p>Now, with the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/us/politics/supreme-court-tiktok-ban-law.html" title="">soon to rule in a case</a> that could determine whether TikTok could be banned in the United States over national security concerns, Ms. Lee and other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/business/tiktok-ban-creators-ads.html" title="">Americans looking for alternatives</a> are downloading Xiaohongshu, a social media app that is popular in China and little known outside the country.</p><p>“How funny would it be if they ban TikTok and we all just move over to this Chinese app,” Ms. Lee wrote on Monday on TikTok encouraging her followers to join her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Xiaohongshu was the most downloaded free app in the U.S. Apple store on Tuesday. Over 300 million people, mostly in China, use the app, where they share short videos as well as still, text-based posts. People flocking to it said, in interviews and on the app, that they wanted to show they do not share Washington’s concerns about TikTok’s ties to China.</p><p>TikTok, which is available in more than 150 countries but not China, is owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance. American creators who post videos on TikTok say the app has been a source of connection, entertainment and information since it became a sensation during the Covid-19 pandemic. Its secret sauce is its proprietary algorithm, technology that recommends a constant stream of short videos targeted to keep people scrolling.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
