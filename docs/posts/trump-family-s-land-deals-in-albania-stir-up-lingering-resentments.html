Trump are stirring up lingering tensions in that country, with the Trump family facing accusations that land it hopes to develop has been improperly set aside for them.</p><p>The disputes relate to $1 billion worth of investments that Ivanka Trump, the former president’s oldest daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner, are pursuing in Albania along the Mediterranean coast of this Southern European nation on land once controlled by a Communist government.</p><p>Mr. Kushner announced plans to build an <a href="https://www.genesisdd.com/peninsula" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opulent hotel and beach villa complex</a> on a stretch of the mainland where an Albanian family has farmed for generations. The family says part of this <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/7f0266cc1120bc00/37b70c93-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">property</a> was corruptly seized from them after the end of Communist rule in 1991.</p><p>“They are trying to take from us what is ours,” said Bledar Alexandros Konomi, who as a young boy used to help tend cattle on the land now proposed for Mr. Kushner’s hotel and whose claim is backed up by <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/3f62d655973bcf0d/eee176f9-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Albanian court records</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At the second site — a small, strategically located island called Sazan where the Soviet Union sent military supplies during the Cold War — Mr. Kushner is working with top government officials in Albania to secure exclusive development rights.</p><p>What has not been public is that there is a second proposal to redevelop the same island submitted by an Albanian American real-estate executive developer from New York, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>The developer, Evi Kokalari-Angelakis, said in an interview that the Albanian government has effectively ignored her proposal to rebuild the site because it wants to impress Mr. Trump, in case he is re-elected and can help Albania with its foreign policy goals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/us/politics/00dc-kushner-albania-06/00dc-kushner-albania-06-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/us/politics/00dc-kushner-albania-06/00dc-kushner-albania-06-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/us/politics/00dc-kushner-albania-06/00dc-kushner-albania-06-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="People swimming at a small beach with blue-green water surrounded by trees." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/us/politics/00dc-kushner-albania-06/00dc-kushner-albania-06-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/us/politics/00dc-kushner-albania-06/00dc-kushner-albania-06-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/us/politics/00dc-kushner-albania-06/00dc-kushner-albania-06-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/us/politics/00dc-kushner-albania-06/00dc-kushner-albania-06-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sazan, the largest island in Albania, sits at a strategic spot north of the border with Greece and just across from the heel of the boot of Italy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ilir Tsouko for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kushner plans to build luxury real estate on the island.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ilir Tsouko for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“My biggest disadvantage is that I am up against Trump’s daughter and son-in-law,” Ms. Kokalari-Angelakis said.

Instead, Mr. Kushner, who served as a White House adviser to Mr. Trump, set up his own investment company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/us/politics/jared-kushner-affinity-partners.html" title="">Affinity Partners,</a> backed mostly with funding from the government of Saudi Arabia, to do deals in locations around the world.</p><p>For these projects in Albania, as well as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/kushner-deal-serbia-trump.html" title="">separate deal in Serbia</a>, Mr. Kushner has teamed up with Richard Grenell, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/us/politics/grenell-trump-cabinet.html" title="">served as a special envoy</a> to the Balkans during the Trump administration.</p><p>Mr. Kushner, in the interview, said his plans already had helped elevate Albania’s global profile as a Mediterranean tourist destination. “We want to make something that people can be very proud of,” he said.</p><p>Sazan, the largest island in Albania, sits at a strategic spot north of the border with Greece and just across from the heel of the boot of Italy.

It would “attract a different kind of crowd, potentially the Elon Musks and the Jeff Bezos of the world, who are constantly cruising the Italian and the Greek coast, while sadly skipping Albania,” the proposal said.</p><p>Ms. Kokalari-Angelakis said she had had conversations with government officials about her plan, and had been asked by the government to prepare a more detailed engineering proposal, only to hear Ms. Trump’s comments during a podcast in July suggesting that the deal had been done. She said she had decided not to spend more money pursuing her project.</p><p>Executives at AIDA, the Albanian agency that oversees such projects, declined a request for an interview. In a written statement, the agency said plans to build on Sazan Island are still under review and “as long as we do not have any decision we do not have information to share.”</p><p>Ms. Kokalari-Angelakis once was a backer of Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Kokalari-Angelakis+" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contributing to</a> his 2020 re-election campaign and even playing a role in <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/ff2840e9a052843f/b94d2693-full.pdf#page=107" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disputing the outcome</a> of that election on his behalf.
