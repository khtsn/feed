</span>, the budding Thai team came out on top yet again, eliminating the high-speed Ascension squad from yet another tournament. The teams met in the lower bracket of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> and were placed in the same groups for Stage 1.  </p>

<p>The series opened on Haven, a map that has been a strong one for the new all-Thai iteration of TALON&#39;s roster. In the buildup to this match, TALON had secured wins against <span data-ref-id="2">

</span> on the three-site map, both by a comfortable 13-6 scoreline.</p>

<p>It looked like a similar outcome was poised to happen in this match, with the Thai team grabbing eight straight rounds on attack after dropping the pistol and ending the half up 9-3. After winning the pistol and anti-eco on their defense half, Nongshim threatened a comeback of their own with a 6-0 run of their own, but eventually fell 13-9.</p>

<p>Star Duelist <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/25255/primmie">

</span> could do no wrong, at least on TALON&#39;s attack half. He went 19/5 on that side of the map. He finished with a 25/13 scoreline and a 300 ACS, far and away the best performer of the map.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="5">

</span> mode activated.</em></p>

<p>On their map pick of Pearl, Nongshim flipped the script on TALON, exploding out of the gates with a 9-3 half attacking half of their own. They stayed true to their go-to double Sentinel comp, pairing Killjoy and Vyse while in-game leader <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/31828/francis">
		Francis	</a>
</span> was on Sova instead of Tejo. </p>

<p>While recent signing <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/13784/killua">
		Killua	</a>
</span> had a solid map for TALON, his team-leading 14 kills matched the lowest amount that any Nongshim player had once the scoreline read 13-7. </p>

<p>The series then moved to Ascent, which has been avoided by both teams for a good portion of the stage. Entering the match, both teams had only played it once in league play, and both lost 13-5. While TALON fielded a more meta double Sentinel comp, Nongshim looked to do something new with a double Controller comp centered around Omen and Harbor.</p>

<p>The map was streaky until the end. Nonshim won the opening four rounds on the attacker side, only for TALON to respond with eight straight to close the half. Nongshim tied things up soon after with another 4-0 run, but as if on cue, TALON clinched four straight to reach match point. After a bit of heroics from the side of Nongshim, TALON closed things out 13-9 off the back of a stellar performance from Killua. His 1.08 rating for the series was a team-high in the victory, while primmie&#39;s server-high 51 kills set the tone for his squad.</p>

</span> has been a shell of its former self in 2025. After a subpar Kickoff and a nearly disastrous group stage, Paper Rex entered the Stage 1 playoffs as a fourth seed, meaning they&#39;d need to survive the lower bracket gauntlet to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/champions-tour-2025-masters-toronto" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. T1, while still the reigning Masters Bangkok champions, has been out of form as of late, too. They finished the group stage with a 3-2 record and a map differential of just +1. After suffering a loss to fellow countrymen DRX in the upper bracket, they too needed a lower bracket run to reach a second straight Masters. </p>

<p>The three-map series was full of blowouts and high-energy moments, with the opening map of Fracture fittingly chaotic. While the map was Paper Rex&#39;s pick, it seemed anything but that to kick things off. T1 started as the defenders, but flipped the map onto PRX, with aggressive pushes and stalwart holds picking apart Paper Rex attackers. </p>

</span> with a pretty ace to finish the first half up 10-2.</em></p>

<p>T1 rode the momentum from a strong defense half to wrap things up 13-3, threatening to make the series a short one on their pick of Ascent. However, there was another twist. While Paper Rex was dealt a knockdown blow in the first map of the series, they swung back and hit hard.</p>

<p>The traditionally defender-sided map favored Paper Rex&#39;s first half, as they went up 8-4, giving up what could be called reasonable rounds. Of the four rounds given up, two were from lighter T1 buys, while one was Paper Rex&#39;s bonus, and the other was a full buy round. With the teams switching sides, the question of whether an 8-4 lead was enough lingered, but was soon erased. </p>

<p>A superb performance from <span data-ref-id="12">

<p><em>A trademark <span data-ref-id="13">

<p>Paper Rex, historically known for its aggressive &#34;W-gaming&#34; displayed it for the first time in a seemingly long time on Lotus. They did to T1 what T1 did to them on Fracture, suffocating the attackers. With a double Duelist comp placing something on Yoru and <span data-ref-id="14">

</span>&#39;s Vyse utility kept a grip on the B site, while the C site was always one Yoru Gatecrash or five-man retake away from being Paper Rex&#39;s. </p>

<p>A 10-2 first half was followed up with aggressive discipline, giving Paper Rex arguably their best win of the year and a longer lease at life in the lower bracket. They move on to play <span data-ref-id="16">
