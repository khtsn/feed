                  <p>In the midst of their chaotic start to the year, the team attended Roman Imperium Cup V with <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/13578/grim" data-tooltip-id="uid1614975828">Michael <span>&#34;⁠Grim⁠&#34;</span> Wince</a> in place of <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/20903/senzu" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid2053457664">Senzu</a>, who could not travel in time for the event, and suffered a quarter-final exit against <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/13404/gentle-mates" data-tooltip-id="uid700967387">Gentle Mates</a>.</p>

                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>Tc, a 2-0 defeat and you&#39;re out of the tournament in the quarter-finals. You knew it was always going to be rough, given the circumstances. What are your main takeaways from the tournament?</strong></p>
                  <p>Overall, we had mostly close scorelines here. But we&#39;ve had two days of practice, and that wasn&#39;t even with Grim. It was with Senzu. We obviously knew, coming here, that it wasn&#39;t going to be easy to get wins, but I think overall, we actually played pretty well. We made some small mistakes that we went over and stuff that we fixed. But it&#39;s tough, considering the circumstances, to come here and expect to win the tournament, right?</p>
                  <p><strong>What was the reason Senzu wasn&#39;t here? Was it visa issues?</strong></p>
                  <p>It&#39;s personal circumstances. He could only travel on the 21st or something like that.</p>
                  <p> <strong>The last couple of weeks have been quite eventful, I would say, with two new players coming in. Walk me through the start of the season and the decision to make two changes just weeks into the season.</strong></p>
                  <p> It&#39;s obviously been a very chaotic start to the season for us. Like everyone else, we were exploring the market during the off-season. That&#39;s what you kind of have to do, at the end of the day, to stay ahead. But we came into the season, obviously, with still full belief in the squad. In Krakow, it didn&#39;t go so well for us. We had Bounty as well, where we got knocked out in the first round. Then, we went to NA, played BLAST… Actually, none of the results affected why we wanted to make the changes so soon. We did explore the market and so on.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>That&#39;s pretty much what sparked all of it, I can say, is the interest from NRG in Grim, and we just had to act fast</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>When Mike [Grim] got the offer from NRG, or when NRG came to buy Mike, that obviously changed things and sped up everything that we had to do and made us act a lot faster on getting new transfers and new players. So that&#39;s pretty much what sparked all of it, I can say, is the interest from NRG in Grim, and we just had to act fast.</p>
                  <p> It was important for us to maintain the Americas region, but we also wanted to get upgrades for the team. As a core, the squad has been together for a very long time, and we were just looking to make some changes, get some fresh blood in, get some fresh ideas. I think we have a really strong squad now, and I think we can play really well as long as we sort out all the communication issues that we might have.</p>
                  <p> <strong>What was the mood like in the camp, with a player who is on his way out of the team? Given that it was his decision to leave, it was kind of normal, right?</strong></p>
                  <p>One hundred percent. The same as usual for us. We&#39;ve played together for three, four years now. There&#39;s no bad blood or anything like this. It&#39;s personal relationships, also, at the end of the day. And for Mike, the move also makes sense because he wants to be on an American team so he can be home more. He has family and his girlfriend back on America. So, honestly, the best case scenario for him is that he can go to an American team, where he can be at home more and he can actually practice in NA. Whereas with us, we are in Europe constantly, we spend so much time away from home. Sometimes, it&#39;s like three months at a time. That&#39;s obviously very difficult when you still have things back home.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>We&#39;ve played together for three, four years now. There&#39;s no bad blood or anything like this</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>I wanted to get your thoughts on try. What do you think he brings to the table compared to hallzerk?</strong></p>
                  <p>Obviously, still very, very early, early days for us. So for me to give, like, an objective opinion, a proper assessment… Like I said, it&#39;s been, like, two days of practice, you know? But so far, I have only good things to say about him. He&#39;s got plenty of ideas. Every round, he&#39;s talking, he has ideas, good reads on the teams as well. We were looking for a strong second voice on the team for a long time.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, with the old team, we had it at times, but no one stepped up into that role fully. And a lot of the times, especially in matches where we were struggling, we really needed that. So with try, especially with his experience from being the IGL of Imperial for a little bit, I think that will help us a lot, hopefully, just to have that stronger second voice, have more ideas in the mid-round and keep things more calm.</p>
                  <p>But, honestly, I have nothing bad to say about hallzerk. He is really, really a great guy. He contributed a lot to the team. A lot of our success was due to him playing well at those times. Often, when hallzerk was playing well, the whole team was playing well as well. Honestly, I&#39;ve got nothing bad to say about hallzerk.</p>
                  <p><strong>I saw the comments from the CEO of Passion, who said Senzu&#39;s English is a bit rough. You&#39;ve practiced with him a little bit, right? So, how is his English? Because he is expected to have such an active role on the team, right?</strong></p>
                  <p>I would say his English is pretty much similar or slightly below the level of what Kvem&#39;s English was when I joined the full Ukrainian roster. Like, why it&#39;s worth it for us to take this chance, Senzu is obviously an amazing player and a really, really good talent. So I think it will develop quite quickly, especially the more he is around the team. Once he is spending time on bootcamp and so on, I think it will evolve really exponentially, pretty much exactly what happened with Kvem&#39;s English.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>I believe he&#39;s also taking English lessons. I&#39;m not sure how long it&#39;s been, it might only have been a week or two weeks or so, but he&#39;s trying from his side as well. After playing with him a little bit, it&#39;s obviously a little bit rough, but it&#39;s going to be [like that] at the start. That&#39;s why you can add set things and so on, so it&#39;s a lot easier to call for these things, and you don&#39;t have to explain what you&#39;re trying to do every round, and people can have an easier time playing around it.</p>
                  <p><strong>He&#39;ll be with you at EPL, right?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yes, he will be with us at EPL and…</p>
                  <p><strong>DraculaN?</strong></p>
                  <p> Actually, we&#39;re not attending that DraculaN. It&#39;s just EPL for us. BC Game Masters Championship, we&#39;re not a hundred percent sure what&#39;s happening after EPL… Like, we are signed up for some tournaments, but we might have to withdraw from some of them because we have some visas that we need to sort out as well. So, obviously, with all the chaotic changes and so on, there are also visa issues and things that we need to sort out. So we&#39;ll be playing EPL. What&#39;s going to happen that, I can&#39;t confirm yet.</p>
                  <p><strong>Because of those circumstances, and now that we&#39;re getting so close to the Major cutoff, what are your goals and expectations for the next couple of months?</strong></p>
                  <p> The main thing for us is qualifying for the Major, right? That&#39;s everyone&#39;s goal for the season. I think, with all the chaos and everything that has been going on, the main thing is just making sure we qualify for the Major. Usually, it would be at least getting to Stage 2 or so, but for now, we have to just take what we can get, right? Because we might have limited opportunities, so we can&#39;t set our expectations too high.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>With all the chaos and everything that has been going on, the main thing is just making sure we qualify for the Major</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>Yeah, just making sure that we can qualify for the Major and get the practice that we need so we can still do well towards the end of the season. Even if we are not qualified for that many things, we at least give ourselves a good chance, heading into the second season.</p>
