Mr. Barnier is expected to resign soon.</p><p>It was the first successful no-confidence vote in France in over 60 years and made Mr. Barnier’s three-month-old government the shortest-tenured in the history of France’s Fifth Republic. </p><p>The vote comes at a difficult time for France, which is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html" title="">struggling with high debt and a widening deficit</a>, challenges that have been compounded by two years of flat growth. France’s strong backing for Ukraine faces a challenge with the United States’ election of Donald J. Trump, and its partner in leading Europe, Germany, is weaker politically and economically than it has been in years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>President Emmanuel Macron, the nation’s top leader, remains in power but support for him is shaky. His stature has been severely diminished following his surprise decision last summer to call a snap parliamentary election. His party and its allies lost many seats to the far right and the left, competing forces that bitterly oppose him.</p><p>Mr. Barnier is likely to remain as a caretaker until Mr. Macron names a new prime minister, but France faces weeks of instability, just as it did after the parliamentary vote. Mr. Macron will address the nation at 8 p.m. Thursday local time, according to the Elysée.</p><p>In 1962, Prime Minister Georges Pompidou was also forced to submit his resignation, but he was later reappointed by President Charles de Gaulle. The same clemency is unlikely to be shown to Mr. Barnier.</p><p>Mr. Barnier, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/europe/france-barnier-prime-minister-le-pen.html" title="">veteran center-right politician</a>, is the most prominent victim yet of France’s polarized politics, unsettled by a middle class that is struggling, as elsewhere in the West.</p><p>The rapid fall seemed inevitable after Mr. Barnier used a constitutional tool to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/europe/france-budget-no-confidence-vote.html" title="">force through a budget proposal</a> on Monday without the approval of Parliament’s lower house, where he does not hold a majority. Use of that tool always raises the hackles of France’s lawmakers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But on Wednesday, it did far more, providing the glue for an unlikely alliance between the assembly’s leftist coalition and the nationalist, anti-immigrant National Rally, which holds the most seats for a single party in the chamber.</p><p>Mr. Barnier’s budget proposal is now null and void. In what amounted to his farewell speech to the chamber on Wednesday, he said the no-confidence vote would “make everything more difficult, and more serious,” noting that without a new budget more households would be subject to taxes and others would see their taxes go up.</p><p>“We need to get beyond our divisions to support our country,” he added.</p><p>The downfall of Mr. Barnier and his cabinet was a victory for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/le-pen-eu-france-embezzlement-trial.html" title="">Ms. Le Pen</a>, who has tried for years to project her growing political influence and to bring her party into the mainstream.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marine Le Pen, the National Rally leader, at the Parliament in Paris on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Badra/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On Wednesday, before the vote, she lashed out at critics who had accused her of provoking instability. “To those who accuse me of choosing the politics of chaos with this no-confidence vote,” she said, “I say that chaos would have meant not rejecting this budget, this government, this collapse.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It was she who insisted on pursuing the vote, ensuring his downfall. The left-wing alliance has been agitating for months to oust the government, arguing that together they had won the most seats in the snap election this summer and so deserved to lead. But it lacked the votes to topple the prime minister.</p><p>And before the vote, Ms. Le Pen refused the concessions that Mr. Barnier offered her on the budget. First, he jettisoned proposed electricity taxes. Then he promised not to cut back medication reimbursements. She had demanded both changes.</p><p>It was not enough for Ms. Le Pen. The budget, with its $60 billion in spending cuts and tax increases, remained “profoundly unjust to the French,” she said on Monday. Mr. Barnier had justified his proposed cuts and tax rises, saying the country needed to address its financial troubles. France’s annual deficit is projected to reach at least 6.1 percent of gross domestic product, twice the limit prescribed by the European Union. Its debt is 112 percent of G.D.P., nearly twice the limit.</p><p>Already, speculation about a possible successor to Mr. Barnier as prime minister has centered on politicians seen by the National Rally as more open to discussion, like the defense minister, Sébastien Lecornu.</p><p>Ms. Le Pen’s criticism of Mr. Barnier and his austerity plans for France seem to form part of a larger political strategy, according to critics and some independent analysts. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>She has all but acknowledged that her real target is not Mr. Barnier, but the only man who wields more power: Mr. Macron, who has twice beaten her in presidential elections and is not permitted to run again. Some in her party and on the far left have been calling on him to resign for days.</p><p>Ms. Le Pen told journalists for Le Monde last week that, confronted with enough government instability, Mr. Macron “won’t have very much choice” but to resign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Emmanuel Macron is regarded as aloof and arrogant.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Stephane De Sakutin</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Analysts and those around Mr. Macron say it is unlikely that he would do so. The president recently called the idea “political fiction.” But his position is weak, severely damaged by his decision last June to dissolve the Parliament and call a snap election. He called the vote partly to demonstrate that the National Rally’s support was limited — a calculation that has clearly backfired.</p><p>Ms. Le Pen has targeted the president as much as the prime minister in her remarks in recent days. It was Mr. Barnier’s budget, she told reporters on Monday, but it would have made the French pay for “the consequences of the incompetence of Emmanuel Macron during seven years of debt.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“She really seems to want to put herself in a position of strength,” said Gérard Grunberg, a political scientist and emeritus professor at Sciences Po university in Paris. “She wants to trigger a presidential election.”</p><p>Mr. Macron has succeeded in bringing down chronically high French unemployment and he has boosted French growth, moderately. But he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/world/europe/france-macron-unpopular.html" title="">also been unpopular</a> for much of his presidency: Many French regard him as aloof and arrogant.</p><p>“Macron has lost all legitimacy,” said Mr. Grunberg. “He doesn’t exist, in a sense. He’s dead, politically.”</p><p>Mr. Macron has given no indication that he won’t finish his term, which ends in mid-2027. Ms. Le Pen, however, may be on an accelerated timeline, according to critics. She is scheduled to face a verdict in a wide-ranging criminal embezzlement case in March, which could render her ineligible to run for political office for five years. She and associates in the party are accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/le-pen-eu-france-embezzlement-trial.html" title="">misusing their European Parliament assistants</a> by putting them to work on National Rally issues.</p><p>“The problem is Ms. Le Pen’s trial,” said Alain Minc, a political essayist, businessman and informal adviser to several French presidents.</p><p>“If she didn’t have that risk of being ineligible, her strategy would have been to remain moderate, to improve her image and wait for the presidential election,” he said. “What has dramatically changed her position is the risk of losing all her political capital in three months’ time.”</p><p>Catherine Porter<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aurelien Breeden<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Nossiter has been bureau chief in Kabul, Paris, West Africa and New Orleans, and is now a Domestic Correspondent on the Obituaries desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-nossiter">More about Adam Nossiter</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/michel-barnier">Michel Barnier</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/national-rally-france">National Rally (France)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/marine-le-pen">Marine Le Pen</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/04/world/europe/france-no-confidence-barnier.html">53</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Undersea Surgeons: </strong>In a wireless world, it is easy to forget the cables that snake across the turbulent ocean floor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/30/world/africa/subsea-cables.html">Until they snap</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mexican Cartels Turn to Students:</strong> Cartels are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/americas/mexico-fentanyl-chemistry-students.html">luring university chemistry students in Mexico</a> with big paydays in their quest to build fentanyl empires.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Sinking Arctic Hamlet:</strong> Canada is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/americas/canada-arctic-permafrost-thawing.html">losing its permafrost to climate change</a>.
