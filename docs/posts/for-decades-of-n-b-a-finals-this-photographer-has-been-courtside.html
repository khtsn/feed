Young athletes including Caitlin Clark have mimicked one of Butler’s most famous photos, of Kobe Bryant embracing a trophy in the shower.</p><p>Since joining the N.B.A. as an intern, Butler has documented many of the league’s most memorable scenes and cultivated relationships with generations of star players.</p><p>“He puts the time and the work in,” said Jayson Tatum, a 27-year-old Boston Celtics forward. “He’s been doing this longer than some of us have been alive, and he’s captured some of the most iconic photos that we all grew up seeing in magazines and online.”</p><p>Butler began his photography career at St. John’s University in Queens in the 1980s, where he captured basketball games for the student newspaper. As he prepared for his 39th N.B.A. finals, he spoke with The New York Times about some of his favorite photos, the process behind them and how technology has changed his job.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Bill Russell, 1996</p><h2 id="link-42910ec7">‘Such a Beautiful Face’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04cul-nba-photos-04-lgvt/04cul-nba-photos-04-lgvt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04cul-nba-photos-04-lgvt/04cul-nba-photos-04-lgvt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04cul-nba-photos-04-lgvt/04cul-nba-photos-04-lgvt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man with a graying goatee smiles while holding his face in his hands.

But he did not have enough championship rings.</p><p>Although Russell won 11 titles for the Celtics between 1957 and 1969, the most in N.B.A. history, players did not receive rings every year like they do now. For the eight-minute photo shoot, Butler recalled, Russell needed to borrow 10 rings from other former players who were nearby.</p><p>The lasting image of Russell with his head in his hands includes 11 rings on his 10 fingers.</p><p>“He has such a beautiful face, so you didn’t want him covering it up,” Butler said. “You wanted to show his personality and his smile<em>.”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Kobe Bryant, 2001</p><h2 id="link-3aad67b3">‘You Just Melt Into the Background’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kobe Bryant reflected in the locker room shower after winning the second of his five N.B.A. titles. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathaniel S.

Bryant, known for his fiercely competitive attitude, was retreating to the shower fully clothed, and he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIjNCzxpKOP/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was later handed the trophy</a> by a staffer.</p><p>The photo of Bryant, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-dead.html" title="">died in a helicopter crash in 2020</a>, has become one of the most recognizable images in N.B.A. lore. According to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2013-may-12-la-sp-0513-kobe-bryant-family-20130513-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Los Angeles Times,</a> Bryant was emotional about his parents’ disapproval about his recent marriage.</p><p><em>“Y</em>ou just melt into the background and document what’s in front of you,” Butler said. “You don’t need a million clicks of the shutter, you just need a couple of frames. It doesn’t have the typical chaos and teammates. It’s him reflecting on what they went through.”</p><p>Magic Johnson, 1987</p><h2 id="link-70286bd5">‘Knowing That You Got the Shot’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Battles between Magic Johnson’s Lakers and Larry Bird’s Celtics defined the league in the 1980s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathaniel S.

But in the 1980s, he shot on black-and-white film and was unable to see images until they finished developing hours later.</p><p>During the N.B.A. finals in 1987, Butler said, he was anxious to review the finished product of Magic Johnson completing a game-winning sky hook over Larry Bird, whose Lakers-Celtics battles were key to the league’s success in the 1980s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Butler said the shot exemplified the angst that photographers had before the process became digitized.</p><p>“There was a lot of nerves in the time you click the shutter to finding out when you’re holding up the negative in a hotel room that you just developed, knowing that you got the shot,” Butler said.</p><p>LeBron James, 2016</p><h2 id="link-5f0df55c">‘The Whole World Was Watching’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>LeBron James’s chase-down block in the final minutes of Game 7 helped the Cleveland Cavaliers win their first title.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathaniel S.

For big games, Butler said he can remotely control up to 10 cameras through a trigger. Although he is primarily stationed on the base lines, those cameras are positioned across the arena, including on the ceiling and behind the basket.</p><p>In the final two minutes of Game 7 of the 2016 N.B.A. finals, Butler used a remote camera to photograph LeBron James blocking a layup attempt by Andre Iguodala, pinning the ball on the backboard after chasing him down the court.</p><p>James’s athletic play kept the game tied, allowing the Cleveland Cavaliers to defeat the Golden State Warriors a few moments later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Butler said he had mixed feelings about the photo. The shot was not taken through his manual lens, and he did not capture James’s hand on the ball.</p><p>“Andre held on to it for a millisecond longer and I hit it,” Butler said. “But that’s a moment. The whole world was watching that play and they remember it.”</p><p>Michael Jordan, 1987</p><h2 id="link-6fc20c5b">‘He’s Flying in the Air’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan appeared to defy gravity at the slam dunk contest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathaniel S.

Butler admires the photo because of Jordan’s athleticism<em>, </em>he said, but it is limited by technology of old.</p><p>The photo was taken before zoom lenses were widely used and available, preventing Butler from showing the scene at his desired scale. He said he wished that he could show the distance between Jordan and the floor.</p><p>“There’s just something about that particular photo — the beauty of Michael — it looks like he’s flying in the air,” Butler said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Ray Allen, 2013</p><h2 id="link-3045cde1">‘A Little Luck Never Hurts’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ray Allen saved the Miami Heat’s season with a 3-pointer that sent Game 6 of the 2013 N.B.A. finals to overtime.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathaniel S.

Had he missed, the San Antonio Spurs would have won the championship and celebrated inside the Heat’s own arena. Instead, Miami won both Game 6 and Game 7.</p><p>Butler, who was positioned on the opposite end of the court, knew Allen was a potent 3-point shooter and took a detailed photograph from a wide angle.</p><p>The image captured the ball dangling in the air, the clock showing 6.7 seconds remaining, James already raising his arms in glee and the nervous faces of fans. The stadium workers in yellow shirts were preparing to block off the court with rope if the Spurs clinched the trophy.</p><p>Butler said he knew to take a wide shot because of the circumstances. Had it been earlier in the game, he said, the picture would have most likely been a close-up of Allen.</p><p>“The context obviously is a huge component of how you frame up the photo<em>,” </em>Butler said. “Experience does play a huge role in that and a little luck never hurts.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Gregg Popovich, 2014</p><h2 id="link-6f91d1cb">‘A Unique Perspective’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The San Antonio Spurs won four championships with Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.

Popovich, 76, who coached the Spurs for 29 seasons, recently stepped into an administrative role after a few health scares.</p><p>“To have the coach with the players huddled around him, it’s just documenting that team from a unique perspective,” Butler said.</p><p>Jayson Tatum, 2024</p><h2 id="link-32e8a223">Tatum: ‘It Was the Perfect Photo’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jayson Tatum and his son, Jayson Tatum Jr., celebrated after the Celtics won last year’s N.B.A. championship.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathaniel S.
