                  <p>Heading into 2026, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/4608/natus-vincere" data-tooltip-id="uid376011468">Natus Vincere</a>&#39;s lineup remained the same despite rumors running rampant about the team exploring their opportunities as the previous season came to a close.</p>
                  <p>The team had made it no secret that they had used the previous season to integrate <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/22673/makazze" data-tooltip-id="uid1085220880">Drin <span>&#34;⁠makazze⁠&#34;</span> Shaqiri</a> and assess their level, but their results still fell short of the organization&#39;s goals of being a consistent title contender.</p>
                  <p>That was until StarLadder Major Budapest, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/472/b1ad3" data-tooltip-id="uid920127754">Andrey <span>&#34;⁠B1ad3⁠&#34;</span> Gorodenskiy</a> explained in an interview with HLTV while at PGL Cluj-Napoca. NAVI&#39;s run to the semi-finals in Budapest, where they narrowly fell short to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/6667/faze" data-tooltip-id="uid1488606163">FaZe</a> in their Cinderella run, ultimately convinced the leadership that there was more to build on with the current composition.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We were close to getting to the finals and, in my opinion, we could have shown a good fight and could compete versus Vitality in the grand final,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/472/b1ad3" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid920127754">B1ad3</a> said.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the map pool change was a full surprise for us. Train was a map we relied on</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>&#34;After the Major, we understood we are at the top of our arch of development, we can build something from this, with this material, with this energy, with this result, with this belief and potential,&#34; he went on. &#34;We believed that this season we will have a lot of potential to be able to be a trophy contender.&#34;</p>
                  <p>Their expectations have, however, been dampened somewhat by the removal of a key map in NAVI&#39;s pool, Train, which came just days before the new season began.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/472/b1ad3" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid920127754">B1ad3</a> believes that it played a part in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/4608/natus-vincere" data-tooltip-id="uid376011468">Natus Vincere</a>&#39;s early elimination from IEM Krakow, where they ended up losing to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/8297/furia" data-tooltip-id="uid851649859">FURIA</a> in the lower bracket, a team that removes the other priority map for NAVI, Ancient.</p>
                  <p>&#34;Unfortunately, the map pool change was a full surprise for us. Train was a map we relied on,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/472/b1ad3" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid920127754">B1ad3</a> admitted. &#34;Train was our highest priority, one of two maps. In Krakow, it was a huge problem because Vitality remove Ancient, FURIA remove Ancient, and it&#39;s our strong map. So yeah, now we are trying to build a good map pool [again] instead of Train.&#34;</p>
                  <p>You can listen to or read the full interview below:</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Heading into 2026, NAVI didn&#39;t end up making any changes. Can you walk me through the mindset you were in during the off-season and why that was the decision in the end?</strong></p>
                  <p>Usually, closer to the end of the season, we always start thinking about what our strategy for the next season is. It&#39;s not smart to start making changes just after the Major, because people can already have some plans or other players, and already decided where to go, so we are always asking players about their plans. It doesn&#39;t mean we will take them, it&#39;s a strategy for the organization for a long time.</p>
                  <p><strong>Just exploring opportunities.</strong></p>
                  <p>Exploring opportunities, and basically putting in our list who we can potentially get. We need to not just take players, but we need to build a squad, all pieces must be in the proper position to work. Eventually, we were looking for some players, asking, but like I said, that doesn&#39;t mean we would change. If we play well, if we see a good dynamic and progress of the current lineup, it will be fine for us, we will just compare what we can achieve with other lineups, brainstorming.</p>
                  <p>Then, obviously, everyone wants to be like Vitality, everyone wants to have star players, but it&#39;s not easy to build this kind of team. That&#39;s why we always focus on what we have and try to squeeze out the maximum.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>The map pool change was a full surprise for us; Train was our highest priority</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>After the Major, we understood we are at the top of our arch of development, we can build something from this, with this material, with this energy, with this result, with this belief and potential. We believed that this season we were focusing and believing that we will have a lot of potential to be able to be a trophy contender, which means we can always be in the semi-finals, maybe finals. With a good day, a good gameplan, we can potentially have it.</p>
                  <p>Basically, it works like this. Every team, if you build any lineup, it needs time to build their own meta fundamentals until they will be trophy contenders. I think it always must be like this. And as soon as you get to this point, you either understand that you&#39;re playing bad and you cannot achieve more, it&#39;s your ceiling, and it&#39;s just useless to keep playing and you&#39;re wasting time of players, everyone is just playing and not winning. Or, you understand that now you have this potential.</p>

                    <p>NAVI&#39;s run in Budapest reassured them about their existing lineup</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>I think the way we played at the Major, we were really close to this. We were close to get to the finals and, in my opinion, we could show a good fight and could compete versus Vitality in the grand final. That was the main strategy before this season. We didn&#39;t focus on winning Krakow. We just focused to start playing tournaments, but now with a different status for ourselves. We believe we can now beat tier-one teams because we built this material we needed, these six months&#39; worth of hard work, where we have everything we need for this.</p>
                  <p>But, unfortunately, the map pool change was a full surprise for us. Train was a map we relied on and we started the bootcamp even building a strategy, we analyzed which teams we can play to be able to win tournaments, and what map pool can be there in the veto. Train was our highest priority, one of two maps. And then we worked on it already during the bootcamp, and they changed it. For us, in Krakow, it was a huge problem because Vitality remove Ancient, FURIA remove Ancient, and it&#39;s our strong map. So yeah, now we are trying to build a good map pool instead of Train.</p>
                  <p><strong>Does that mean the goals change, then? After you brought in makazze, the last season was a lot about integrating him into the system. Now, the expectation shifts more towards being able to contend for trophies, even if it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you will win them?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yes, now this is the plan, but at the same time, we took a little step back because we need to build the map pool. At the start of the season, we thought we had it, and now we don&#39;t have the map pool we need to win trophies. We can beat teams, obviously, but to win trophies you need a really good map pool.</p>
                  <p>For now, makazze is feeling much more comfortable after this last season, and we know how we can use everyone now. We know our strengths, our weaknesses, and we also have a good vibe in the team.</p>
                  <p><strong>You started the season with a loss to Monte, and then in Krakow you had a pretty tough draw, playing Spirit into FURIA. How did those two tournaments go compared to your expectations? What did you take away from them?</strong></p>
                  <p>Bounty, we just tried to play, but we didn&#39;t analyze it too much. We understand we are the team that we need to remind everything we had in the previous season, and for this you need at least two weeks, for sure, to practice, analyze, practice, analyze, and you see people are on point in terms of knowledge and connecting to each other.</p>
                  <p>Krakow, like I said, the problem with the map pool, and we also had really good maps versus different opponents, Spirit, FURIA... I think we fought really well against Spirit on Mirage and with FURIA on Inferno, and we also had a really good match versus PARIVISION. In terms of this fighting potential, when you are resisting and constantly fighting till the end, you have this belief, this confidence. This point was important. It&#39;s very important nowadays. A lot of teams are very equal to each other, and the teams that will activate their potential, this team can have finals or win tournaments.</p>
                  <p>You saw that FURIA was close to be eliminated, like three rounds, and when they had their back to the wall, they somehow activated. This is how they turned themselves on, and then they started to play better CS. This is important, top 10 teams need to be able to use and activate their potential knowledge and synergy that they can have. You can take any team and see their peak in the past, and it means they have this potential. This is all you need to do. It&#39;s not an easy task, in my opinion, because it&#39;s tournament after tournament, a routine, and you need to be able to build the skill when you are fully present.</p>

                    <p>w0nderful struggled in Krakow with a 0.82 rating in three series</p>
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>I wanted to ask about w0nderful. He ended the year on a really high note at the Major, and you spoke about his breakthrough in terms of his mental approach to the game and some of these pressure moments. In the new year, he had an off tournament in Krakow, one of his worst. What happened there? Was there something you needed to address?</strong></p>
                  <p>w0nderful is always about his mentality. We always try to control it, to remind, to work on this and he also tries by himself, but this is his feature, let&#39;s say. He can be very confident, sometimes he can lose confidence, and he can tilt sometimes, and it&#39;s all about finding this confidence for him, to find this balance and confidence.</p>
                  <p>For an AWPer, it&#39;s very important to do the moves and to be comfortable with his moves, in a micro universe, when he&#39;s playing, he needs to be fully in the flow to be able to hit the shots, to know the angles, to feel the timings, everything. We will see more at this tournament, but we don&#39;t pressure him at all, we&#39;re just trying to activate him as much as possible.</p>
                  <p><strong>Anubis came in with a couple of changes. What do you think about these changes and how they impact how the map plays compared to the previous version?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think that the map is still T-sided, but it&#39;s for sure much easier to play on the CT side now. You have so many more opportunites on the CT side. It&#39;s all about your creativity. It&#39;s just a matter of time before people start using it. For T side you need to do more steps. Before it was a map where you don&#39;t need to do anything and you have everything on the T side. Now, at least they need to do some steps before doing something, or the CT side will have a lot of control.</p>
                  <p>With the gap, people can piece the puzzle much more easily, because they have more vision now. Even for example, if people are now pop on Anubis, imagine how fast the guy and how comfortable he can be, who can jump from Mid to Connector. It&#39;s much more comfortable. Before, he needed to go to Bridge and there can be somebody holding the gap.</p>
                  <p>Eternal Fire was doing something with woxic on Stairs holding this gap. Now, it&#39;s hard to hold this gap if he&#39;s playing like before. He needs to hold A, he needs to hold Gap, and the guy can easily cross Bridge to top Mid. Before he was holding this to prevent crossing the bridge. Now it&#39;s fully different. For CT side it&#39;s for sure good changes.</p>
                  <p><strong>I wanted to ask you about the FUT guys, a team you are very familiar with from their time as NAVI Junior. What did you think about them? They impressed in Krakow, and they were already on the way up last year.</strong></p>
                  <p>First of all, I think you need to check statistics of how often these last-moment invited teams were doing miracles at tournaments, okay? I remember people played well sometimes, and some teams were even winning, I remember. They are a young team, they&#39;re just starting their path, so obviously there cannot be miracles and they cannot become a tier-one team instantly, they need to work more, they need experience. It works like this, unfortunately, always. You need experience, more and more, to be stable, like all other top 10 teams.</p>
                  <p>But they have this young blood and good mechanic skills, firepower. People will get used to them and it will be much harder to play for them, also. But they&#39;re playing very aggressive, in my opinion, and aggressive play, nowadays in CS2, is pretty meta.</p>
