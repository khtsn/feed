Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan and dozens of other schools face federal inquiries and fear similar penalties, and college administrators have said Columbia’s response to the White House’s demands may set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>This week, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-to-pause-175-million-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy.html" title="">University of Pennsylvania</a> was also explicitly targeted by the Trump administration, which said it would cancel $175 million in federal funding for the university, at least partly because it allowed a transgender woman to participate on a women’s swim team.</p><p>Columbia, facing the loss of government grants and contracts over what the administration said was a systemic failure to protect students and faculty members “from antisemitic violence and harassment,” opted to yield to many of the administration’s most substantial demands.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The university said it had agreed to hire a new internal security force of 36 “special officers” who will be empowered to remove people from campus or arrest them. The wearing of face masks on campus will also be banned for the purpose of concealing identity during disruptions, with exceptions for religious and health reasons.</p><p>Columbia will also adopt a formal definition of antisemitism, something many universities have shied away from even as they, like Columbia, faced pressure to do so amid protests on their campuses over the war in Gaza.</p><p>Columbia’s interim president, Katrina A. Armstrong, said in a letter on Friday that the university’s actions were part of its effort to “make every student, faculty and staff member safe and welcome on our campus.”</p><p>“The way Columbia and Columbians have been portrayed is hard to reckon with,” Dr. Armstrong said. “We have challenges, yes, but they do not define us.”</p><p>She added: “At all times, we are guided by our values, putting academic freedom, free expression, open inquiry, and respect for all at the fore of every decision we make.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Trump administration demanded each of the changes in a letter to Columbia officials on March 13. A spokeswoman for the Education Department, one of three federal agencies named in the letter, did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment, including to questions about the potential restoration of federal funding.</p><p>In perhaps the most contentious move, Columbia said it would appoint a senior vice provost to oversee the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies Department. The White House had demanded that the department be placed under academic receivership, a rare federal intervention into an internal process that is typically reserved as a last resort for extended periods of internal dysfunction.</p><p>Columbia did not refer to the move as receivership, but it appeared to resemble that measure.</p><p>Legal scholars and advocates for academic freedom expressed alarm on Friday over what they described as Columbia’s dangerous surrender to President Trump at a perilous moment for higher education. Some critics of the university’s response said they feared the White House could target any recipient of federal funds, including K-12 public schools, hospitals, nursing homes and business initiatives.</p><p>Sheldon Pollock, a retired former chair of the university’s Middle Eastern studies department, said in a text message that “Columbia faculty are utterly shocked and profoundly disappointed by the trustees’ capitulation to the extortionate behavior of the federal government.”</p><p>“This is a shameful day in the history of Columbia,” Dr. Pollock said, adding that it would “endanger academic freedom, faculty governance and the excellence of the American university system.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The moves by Columbia were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The school’s response to the administration’s demands was the latest turn in a turbulent phase that began 17 months ago, when pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students organized competing protests in the days after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.</p><p>Since then, the Manhattan campus has experienced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/nyregion/columbia-university-tent-city-palestinian-protest.html" title="">rare summoning of the police</a> to quell protests, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/columbia-president-nemat-shafik.html" title="">president’s resignation</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university.html" title="">detention of</a> Mahmoud <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university.html" title="">Khalil, a recent graduate</a>, by federal immigration officials.</p><p>The extraordinary cancellation of funding for the university escalated the crisis, imperiling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/nyregion/columbia-research-grants-trump.html" title="">research that includes dozens of medical and scientific studies</a>. (The university did not mention the loss of funds in outlining the steps it was taking.)</p><p>Columbia’s announcement on Friday came at a relatively calm moment on campus, with many professors and students away because of spring break. But the prospect of a second consecutive spring semester marked by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/nyregion/columbia-commencement-cancel-protests.html" title="">protest and upheaval</a> still loomed.</p><p>Despite the changes, the current fraught chapter in Columbia’s 270-year history may not be over. The Trump administration has told the university that meeting its demands was “a precondition for formal negotiations” over a continued financial relationship and that the White House may call for other “immediate and long-term structural reforms.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Many of the changes Columbia agreed to make involve issues that have been points of contention on campus for some time.</p><p>Face masks, for example, emerged as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/nyregion/mask-ban-ny-hochul.html" title="">source of conflict</a> last year amid the Gaza protests, with demonstrators saying they should be able to conceal their identities to avoid being doxxed, and others arguing that mask-wearing makes it harder to hold protesters accountable if their actions veer into harassment.</p><p>The detainment this month of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university.html" title="">Mr. Khalil</a>, a prominent figure in the protests who stood out because he chose not to wear a mask, cast a spotlight on the issue.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Troy Closson is a Times education reporter focusing on K-12 schools.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/troy-closson">More about Troy Closson</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/education-department-us">Education Department (US)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>In the Ring, His Parents’ Money Doesn’t Matter:</strong> Sean O’Bradaigh grew up in a world of Manhattan privilege, but private schools and ski vacations have nothing on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/in-the-ring-it-doesnt-matter-how-much-money-his-parents-have.html">dream of being a professional boxer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Subway Ninja’:</strong> In the lowest moment of Selwyn Bernardez’s life, he attacked a stranger with a sword.
