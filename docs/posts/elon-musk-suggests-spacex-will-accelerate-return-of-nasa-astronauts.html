NASA has not responded to questions about whether it was indeed working to have those astronauts come home sooner, which could leave the space station understaffed.</p><p>Hours later, Mr. Trump in his own post <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113909188940119917" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the website Truth Social</a>, confirmed the request, stating that “Elon will soon be on his way,” without setting a time frame for a return trip.</p><p>The astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/science/boeing-starliner-space-station-docking.html" title="">docked at the space station in June</a>. Their trip was not supposed to last much longer than a week or two in orbit as part of a test flight of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/05/science/boeing-launch-starliner-nasa" title="">Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft</a>. But because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/science/space/boeing-starliner-space-station-nasa.html" title="">Starliner’s propulsion system malfunctioned</a> during the trip there, NASA repeatedly extended the pair’s stay as engineers tried to figure out what had gone wrong.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In his posting, Mr. Musk added, “Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.”</p><p>In his Truth Social post, Mr. Trump echoed that sentiment, claiming that Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore had been “virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.” In fact, the space station has been <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/space-station-visiting-vehicles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resupplied four times</a> since the two arrived.</p><p>Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator during the Biden administration, did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p><p>Lingering unease with the vehicle led NASA officials to decide that Starliner would return to Earth without Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore, who remained in orbit as part of the space station crew. At that time, Mr. Nelson said the foremost concern of NASA officials was the safety of Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore.</p><p>The Starliner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/science/boeing-starliner-nasa-space-station.html" title="">landed without problems</a> on Sept. 7.</p><p>Two extra astronauts in orbit led NASA and its international partners to juggle the next crew heading to the space station on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, a mission called Crew-9.</p><p>Astronauts generally spend about half a year on the space station before returning on the same spacecraft they flew on to get there. But because Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore no longer had a ride home, two of the four astronauts originally assigned for Crew-9 were left on the ground when the mission launched on Sept. 28. That left two seats for Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore for the return trip, which was then expected in February.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Before astronauts return, NASA prefers that their replacements arrive first to avoid periods of understaffing, which hampers scientific research on the space station and potentially leaves the smaller crew overwhelmed in case of an emergency.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Suni Williams during a spacewalk outside the International Space Station earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>If something on the NASA side of the outpost broke and required a spacewalk to repair, there would just be one NASA astronaut aboard — Don Pettit — to perform the task. That would be dangerous, as spacewalks are usually conducted in pairs. The two Russian astronauts on board could help, but they are less familiar with those systems.</p><p>For the next astronaut launch, Crew-10, SpaceX has been planning to use a brand-new Crew Dragon.</p><p>But in December, NASA announced that SpaceX needed more time to finish manufacturing and testing of the new capsule and that the return of Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore had been delayed again, to late March.</p><p>NASA has avoided <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronauts.html" title="">calling the astronauts “stranded,”</a> as Mr. Musk did in his post. The space agency has repeatedly insisted that Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/science/nasa-suni-williams-healthy.html" title="">in good health</a> and that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/science/boeing-starliner-astronauts-wilmore-williams.html" title="">their extended stay</a> falls well within the range of other astronauts’ times in orbit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Speeding up the return might present NASA officials with difficult choices. They could leave the station understaffed, with just three astronauts — two Russians, one American — instead of the usual complement of seven, until the new Crew Dragon arrives.</p><p>In principle, NASA could have just Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore return and leave the other astronauts who launched in September in orbit. But that would leave those astronauts without a way to get back to Earth if they needed to evacuate.</p><p>Or SpaceX could use one of its older Crew Dragons, possibly bumping astronauts from a scheduled flight to the space station in the spring on a private mission run by the company Axiom Space of Houston.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
