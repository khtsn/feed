frozen lake that sits along his bucolic 150-acre farm in the hinterlands of Ontario, periodically stamping his foot to be sure. I followed his lead, bundled in a polar-rated Baffin snowsuit he’d wisely insisted I wear for this expedition.</p><p>A few decades ago, this easily could have been a setup. He was, after all, a guy who became superstar famous for audacious pranks that captured the bubbling, cheeky rebellion of Y2K-era youth. But that absurdity was kept at bay that frigid Tuesday in early January. Green, 53, is not quite the same troublemaker who crawled around on the street, interviewing unsuspecting passers-by with a “piece of poo on a microphone,” as he did in one of his most memorable bits.</p><p>He’s since moved on from those high jinks, even as similar content has proliferated across screens.

As Green recovered, a new batch of stars was minted.
