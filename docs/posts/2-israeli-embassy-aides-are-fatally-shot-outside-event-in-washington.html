We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody. Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum. He approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire, striking both of our decedents. The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of free Palestine, is a young couple about to be engaged. The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. They were a beautiful couple who came to enjoy an evening in Washington’s cultural center.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21dc-shooting-02-qlwt/21dc-shooting-02-qlwt-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The fatal shooting occurred on a street outside the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting a reception for young diplomats.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Allison Robbert for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-05-22T05:04:03-04:00"><span>Published <!-- -->May 21, 2025</span><span>Updated <!-- -->May 22, 2025, <span>5:04 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Two young Israeli Embassy aides were shot and killed outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in downtown Washington on Wednesday night by a man who shouted pro-Palestinian slogans after he was detained, according to law enforcement officials.</p><p>The close-range shooting occurred shortly after 9 p.m. on a street outside the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting a reception for young diplomats.
