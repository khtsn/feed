I was outside of Washington, I was not stigmatized by the mistakes that had been made in those previous years.” “It’s a long way from Plains, Ga., to Washington, D.C.” “And I brought a fresh face of a peanut farmer, a working man who swore never to tell a lie or make a misleading statement. Jimmy Carter from Georgia. I hope to be your next president.” “The president and his family surprise and delight everyone by walking the parade route down Pennsylvania Ave. up to the presidential reviewing stand in front of the White House.” But winning the White House at the height of the Cold War carried extraordinary responsibility. “The system is survivable. It’s verifiable.” The peanut farmer from Plains suddenly had his finger on the button to start World War III. “It’s a horrifying thought. If the Soviets launched a missile attack from Soviet territory, we had 26 minutes before the missile struck New York or Washington or whatever, for me to respond. And so I knew what — that I would have to respond, which may result in a holocaust. So I went out of my way to understand the problems of Brezhnev. I used to sit by a globe and turn it to Moscow, and try to imagine how it looked out on the rest of the world with a formidable military force in NATO and tremendous challenge from China. And what would happen if the Soviets became convinced that they were in danger. Well, I tried to avoid all that, but it was a very, very terrible responsibility. To give our own and our nation’s security.” Carter took pains to keep the peace and to broker a nuclear arms deal. But when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, he rolled out a covert mission to arm Afghan resistance fighters and announced a boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. “With Soviet invading forces in Afghanistan, neither the American people nor I will support sending an Olympic team to Moscow.” The goal, he says, was to pressure the Soviets to reform. “I wanted to change their system of government, but I also wanted to bring the Soviet Union into the international forum. The Soviet Union had, in effect, promised to honor human rights, and they had failed. But over a period of time, I think that may or may not have had an impact on Mikhail Gorbachev when he decided on glasnost and perestroika, and that in effect, resulted in the dismantlement of the Soviet Union, and also resulted in the withdrawal of Soviet invading troops from Afghanistan.” Despite his ongoing struggles with the Soviets, Carter forged major accomplishments in foreign policy: opening diplomatic relations with China, pushing through a Panama Canal treaty and brokering a historic Middle East peace deal. “Sun and tension on the Egyptian-Israeli border.” “I recognized before I was president the importance of the Mideast crisis between Israel and Egypt because there had been four major wars in the previous 25 years. I was able to bring Sadat and Begin to Camp David, and we had a very successful 13 days there. And we came out with the Camp David Accords, which led six months later to a treaty between Israel and Egypt. Not a word of which has ever been violated since.” But the watershed agreement did not fix the problems dogging Carter’s presidency: runaway inflation. “We must face a time of national austerity.” The energy crisis. “All of us must learn to waste less energy.” And a management style that Americans found pessimistic and uninspiring. “It is a crisis of confidence.” The final blow for Carter’s re-election came in November 1979. “Good evening. The U.S. Embassy in Tehran has been invaded and occupied by Iranian students.” More than 50 Americans were taken hostage in Iran and held for 444 days until the final hours of Carter’s presidency. “We had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did — either strengthen our security there or remove our personnel.” Polls predicted a close race, but in the end, Carter won in just five states and Washington, D.C. “And this country is almost solidly in the Reagan colors tonight.” After leaving the White House, Jimmy Carter reinvented himself. And redefined the role of a former president, finding his new purpose and esteem as a freelance statesman. [speaking Spanish] Carter says even political rivals asked for his diplomatic help. “Ronald Reagan didn’t take an active interest in the Mideast. He disavowed many of the things that I had done, and to my surprise, he called me on the phone and asked if I would help draft a speech that he wanted to deliver on the subject. And I responded eagerly. So he sent his national security adviser or his speechwriter — I can’t remember which — down to my home, and in the front room of my house, we drafted the portion of his speech delivered in 1982 on the Middle East.” “With respect to the Arab-Israeli conflict, we’ve embraced the Camp David framework as the only way to proceed.” “When George Bush senior came into the White House, they were interested in Latin America. They specifically asked me to get involved in holding an election that replaced the Sandinistas peacefully instead of by war, and ended the war. The Contra problem for Nicaragua will be solved by an honest election.” Carter’s diplomatic skills really got put to the test in 1994, when tensions between President Clinton and Kim Il Sung over North Korea’s nuclear program put the two countries on a collision course. “Kim Il Sung was giving me constant requests that I come to Pyongyang and help him resolve the impasse. I wrote President Clinton a letter and said, I have decided to go to North Korea. Al Gore, the vice president, was in the White House and he intercepted my letter and he said, ‘Mr. President, if you’ll change your letter to say I’m strongly inclined to go to North Korea instead of I’m going to North Korea, I’ll try to get President Clinton to agree to approve.’” Carter finally got the green light from the White House, or so he thought. “They didn’t think I had any chance to succeed. Good morning. I succeeded.” Key for Carter was having CNN camera crews broadcasting the historic negotiations. “I’m a nuclear engineer by training. I knew the intimacies of their nuclear power plant. I talked to their nuclear specialists and also directed to Kim Il Sung. And he and I agreed that he would not proceed with his nuclear program. The proposal was that there would be an immediate assurance that the I.A.E.A. inspectors would stay on site. When I got back to Seoul, though, I was told by the White House that they were dissatisfied. Al Gore was on the speakerphone. I said, I want to come to Washington and explain what I’ve done. And he told me, ‘Mr. President, you are not wanted in Washington. Our suggestion is you go directly back to Plains.’ Well, I was angry, put it mildly. I thought I had prevented a war. I thought I had worked out a satisfactory agreement for the future.” As soon as Carter touched down in the U.S., the press was filled with stories about how Carter had turned what was meant to be a private visit into a televised summit. “There were horrendous stories about me in The New York Times that I had exceeded my authority and that I had made false claims about the acquiescence of Kim Il Sung. That I was naive and ignorant and so forth. So I sent Kim Il Sung an urgent letter, and asked him to confirm to Clinton, not to me, all the agreements he had reached. I think there were 12 of them. And so that was adopted by the Clinton administration as their policy.” That policy did help to avert war. But critics say Jimmy Carter and President Clinton were wrong to appease a rogue nation like North Korea, which would later develop a nuclear arsenal in violation of the agreement he helped broker. In his later years, Carter traveled the globe with the Carter Center to fight disease and monitor elections in emerging democracies. “We believe that all of our questions have been answered.” Work that earned the former president a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, just as he was forging a very public campaign opposing the coming American invasion of Iraq. “Global challenges must be met by an emphasis on peace.” When we sat down with President Carter in 2006, he laid out his vision for America’s role in the future and his concerns about missteps in the post-9/11 world. “The announcement and practice of preemptive war, the complete abandonment of all the nuclear arms control agreements that were reached, the claim, in effect, that prisoners could be mistreated or tortured or deprived of habeas corpus, these are some of the things that I think has caused a deterioration in our country’s basic stature and integrity. I would like to see our country be the champion of human rights. And every American Embassy looked upon as a haven for those who suffer from human rights abuse. I’d like to see our country be the most generous on earth. These are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments, but the affirmation of our nation’s continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever expanding American dream.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/28/multimedia/00jimmy-carter-carousel-2-update-1-0b6a/00jimmy-carter-carousel-2-update-1-0b6a-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In a never-before-seen interview with The Times in 2006, Jimmy Carter reflects on his life and work as a Cold War leader, Middle East peace broker and post-presidential career as a citizen diplomat.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Neal Boenzi/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker" itemprop="name">Peter Baker</a> and <span itemprop="name">Roy Reed</span></p><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times; Roy Reed, who died in 2017, was a Times national correspondent who for many years covered the South.</p></div></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-12-30T01:36:57-05:00"><span>Published <!-- -->Dec. 29, 2024</span><span>Updated <!-- -->Dec. 30, 2024, <span>1:36 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/12/30/espanol/jimmy-carter-expresidente-muere.html" data-version="es" title="Read in Spanish">Leer en español</a><a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20241230/jimmy-carter-dead/" data-version="zh-hans" title="Read in Simplified Chinese">阅读简体中文版</a><a href="https://cn.nytimes.com/usa/20241230/jimmy-carter-dead/zh-hant/" data-version="zh-hant" title="Read in Traditional Chinese">閱讀繁體中文版</a></p></div></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Jimmy Carter, who rose from Georgia farmland to become the 39th president of the United States on a promise of national healing after the wounds of Watergate and Vietnam, then lost the White House in a cauldron of economic turmoil at home and crisis in Iran, died on Sunday at his home in Plains, Ga. He was 100.</p><p>The Carter Center in Atlanta announced his death, which came nearly three months after Mr. Carter, already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/us/politics/how-old-is-jimmy-carter.html" title="Times article ">the longest-living president</a> in American history, became the first former commander in chief to reach the century mark. Mr. Carter went into hospice care 22 months ago, but endured longer than even his family expected.</p><p>Tributes poured in from presidents, world leaders and many everyday people from around the world who admired not only Mr. Carter’s service during four years in the White House but his four decades of efforts since leaving office to fight disease, broker peace and provide for the poor. President Biden ordered a state funeral to be held and was expected to deliver a eulogy.</p><p>“To all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning — the good life — study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith and humility,” Mr. Biden, the first Democratic senator to endorse Mr. Carter’s long-shot 1976 bid for the presidency, said in a statement. “He showed that we are great nation because we are a good people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump, who often denigrated Mr. Carter and in recent days spoke of unraveling one of his signature accomplishments, the transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama, issued a gracious statement. “The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country, and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans,” Mr. Trump said. “For that, we owe him a debt of gratitude.”</p><p>Mr. Carter was no fan of Mr. Trump and family members said he was holding on in part to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/jimmy-carter-votes-georgia.html" title="">cast his absentee ballot</a> for her in mid-October after making his final public appearance on his birthday when he was rolled out to his yard in a wheelchair to watch a flyover of military jets in his honor.</p><p>Other than interludes in the White House and the Georgia governor’s mansion, he and his wife, the former first lady Rosalynn Carter, lived in the same simple home in Plains for most of their adult lives and each of them passed away there, Mrs. Carter in November last year.</p><p>A lifelong farmer who still worked with his hands building houses for the poor well into his 90s, Mr. Carter had long defied death and outlived not only his wife but his vice president, most of his cabinet, key aides and allies as well as the Republican president he defeated and the Republican challenger who later defeated him. Over the years, he beat back a series of health crises, including a bout with the skin cancer melanoma, which spread to his liver and brain, and repeated falls, one giving him a broken hip.</p><p>The Carter Center announced in February last year that Mr. Carter, “after a series of short hospital stays,” had decided to forgo further life-prolonging medical treatment and would receive hospice care at home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>News that he seemed to be in his final days prompted a wave of appreciations and remembrances of his extended and eventful life, but even then he upended expectations by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/jimmy-carter-hospice-anniversary.html" title="">living</a> for nearly two years. He lived long enough to bid farewell to Mrs. Carter, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/19/us/politics/rosalynn-carter-dead.html" title="">died at 96</a>, culminating a marriage of 77 years.</p><p>Mr. Carter’s death sets the stage for the first presidential funeral since that of George H.W. Bush in 2018, to culminate in a service at Washington National Cathedral. Such occasions traditionally prompt a cease-fire in America’s fractious political wars as the nation’s leaders pause to remember and bid farewell to one of their own. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Trump would attend.</p><p>With his peanut farmer’s blue jeans, his broad, toothy grin and his promise never to tell a lie, Mr. Carter was a self-professed outsider intent on reforming a broken Washington in an era of lost faith in government. He became one of his generation’s great peacemakers with his Camp David accords, bringing together Israel and Egypt, but he could not turn around a slumping economy or free American hostages seized by militants in Iran in time to win a second term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/21/multimedia/00Carter-Jimmy-LifeinPhotos-2017-qjzk/00Carter-Jimmy-LifeinPhotos-2017-qjzk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/21/multimedia/00Carter-Jimmy-LifeinPhotos-2017-qjzk/00Carter-Jimmy-LifeinPhotos-2017-qjzk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/21/multimedia/00Carter-Jimmy-LifeinPhotos-2017-qjzk/00Carter-Jimmy-LifeinPhotos-2017-qjzk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Mr. Carter, in a blue shirt and bluejeans, stands in a garden setting with a wooded area in the background.

In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/opinion/jan-6-jimmy-carter.html" title="">an essay</a> for The New York Times on the first anniversary of Jan. 6, he warned that “our great nation now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss” and called for changes to avoid “losing our precious democracy.”</p><p>Long a favorite target for Republicans, Mr. Carter’s name came up repeatedly as a foil for Mr. Trump to mock Mr. Biden even after the incumbent president withdrew from this year’s race. “Jimmy Carter is the happiest man because Jimmy Carter is considered a brilliant president by comparison,” Mr. Trump said on Mr. Carter’s 100th birthday. Mr. Biden’s critics compared high inflation on his watch to the price increases of Mr. Carter’s presidency, and the fall of Afghanistan to the Iran hostage crisis.</p><p>Mr. Carter went to Washington with an outsider’s promise to “drain the swamp” and make America great again four decades before Mr. Trump expressed those same aims. But the two could hardly have come from more different origins. Unlike the thrice-married New York playboy mogul with the flashy golf resorts and the private airliner, Mr. Carter grew up on a peanut farm with no electricity or running water.

Minutes after his Inaugural Address in January 1977, he surprised the crowds lining Pennsylvania Avenue when he and Rosalynn Carter and their 9-year-old daughter, Amy, got out of the <a href="http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/01/21/75025691.html?pageNumber=27" title="">presidential limousine</a> and walked the parade route to the White House, smiling and waving in the sunshine as spectators cheered.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Carter once said that he had gone to the capital to restore the country’s faith in itself after the twin traumas of Watergate and Vietnam — to build a “new foundation,” as he put it, of trust, decency and compassion.</p><p>Meeting that goal would have been hard enough without the intrusions of national and international crises. His four-year tenure was a story of distraction, disappointment and serial drama that came to an end only in the last tortured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/21/us/reagan-takes-oath-40-th-president-promises-era-national-renewal-minutes-later-52.html" title="">minutes of his presidency</a>, with the release of Americans held hostage by Iranians for 444 days.</p><h2 id="link-7fa8319f">Troubles and Triumphs</h2><p>To his critics, Mr. Carter often undermined his own ambitions through stubbornness and insufficient attention to the egos and political needs of others in the government. His unorthodox style — informal in his cardigan sweaters but uncomfortable with the glad-handing ways of Washington — and an unfortunate confluence of circumstances cost him dearly in the domestic arena.</p><p>There was an intractable energy problem brought on by an Arab oil embargo. Inflation soared, and so did interest rates, leaving businesses and home buyers deeply discouraged. He found himself at odds with an increasingly assertive Congress controlled by his own party.

Several recently published books argued that his presidency had been more consequential than it was given credit for.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/books/review/his-very-best-jonathan-alter.html" title="">“His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life,”</a> published in 2020, Jonathan Alter called him “perhaps the most misunderstood president in American history,” one who was ahead of his time on the environment, foreign policy and race relations.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/opinion/kai-bird-jimmy-carter-life.html" title="">Kai Bird maintained</a> in “The Outlier: The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter” (2021) that the traditional view of Mr. Carter as a better former president than president was belied by the historical evidence. “The record of these achievements is not to be lightly dismissed,” he wrote.</p><p>And Stuart E. Eizenstat, Mr. Carter’s domestic policy adviser, insisted in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/books/review/president-carter-stuart-eizenstat.html" title="">“President Carter: The White House Years”</a> (2018) that the former president was a thoroughly decent, honorable man who had been underrated.

Johnson, a Texan who ascended to the Oval Office upon the assassination of his predecessor before being elected to a full term. To many Americans it was remarkable that a molasses-voiced Southerner from what had been a white-supremacist section of Georgia could win the presidency just over a decade after the death of Jim Crow.</p><p>Defeated in 1980 by Mr. Reagan, Mr. Carter went home to Plains not only disappointed but also worn in body and spirit. Then he set about rebuilding. He became a global humanitarian, an author, a professor and a wealthy landowner, engaging in public affairs to a degree not seen among former presidents in modern times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carter at his Georgia home in July 1976 while working on the acceptance speech he would give at the Democratic National Convention.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">D.L.

By 2016, he supported Senator Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont, over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the more centrist party favorite, for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p><p>In his path to power, Mr. Carter had pledged a government “as good as the American people,” but he showed little talent for the compromise and dealing that politics demands. He envisioned fundamental changes in policies ranging from taxes to the organization of federal agencies, but he found that Congress was unwilling or unable to enact them. He had been trained as an engineer and a problem solver, but he came up against a nation that had grown hesitant, drained and divided by war in Southeast Asia and demoralized by scandal in the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>When Mr. Carter announced his <a href="http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/12/13/79883508.html?pageNumber=1" title="">presidential candidacy</a> in 1974, his political qualifications seemed unexceptional. He had been governor of Georgia for a single term and before that a state senator. He started adulthood as a Navy officer, then went home to run the family business. His first dalliance with politics was little more than the expression of civic involvement expected of such men in small towns everywhere.</p><p>Then, as his interest in public affairs deepened, it became obvious that the man was not ordinary and never had been. There was an intensity about him, a drive to learn and excel, that few outside his family and friends had noticed.</p><p>He was similarly underestimated when he walked onto the national stage in the 1970s. And even after voters had elected him president in 1976, they still knew little about him, except that they liked him and that he seemed to be honest and decent and untainted by the nation’s recent dishonor.</p><h2 id="link-152674b7">Peanuts, Bibles and Politics</h2><p>James Earl Carter Jr. was born in Plains on Oct. 1, 1924, into a family not wealthy but “well off,” as Southerners put it.

Earl Sr. treated Black neighbors fairly, the younger Mr. Carter said, but insisted on the customary boundaries. His mother, on the other hand, refused to acknowledge most racial distinctions. Years later, when Lyndon Johnson ran for president, Miss Lillian, as she was known, managed his local campaign office. Segregationists repeatedly vandalized her car.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>The Carter farm was at Archery, a hamlet just west of Plains that no longer exists. Jimmy lived there — in a one-story white-frame house, now a National Historic Site — from 1928 through the Depression. He saw many sharecropper families subsisting on fatback, cornmeal and molasses with an occasional squirrel or possum. </p><p>Jimmy learned the proper way to cook possum. “They were always baked whole,” he wrote, “smothered in sweet potatoes, apples, or other fruits, vegetables and spices that never adequately concealed their unique taste.”</p><p>By 1937, three other children had been born into the Carter house: Gloria in 1926, Ruth in 1929 and Billy in 1937. </p><p>Their living was primitive by today’s standards. They drew water from a well and relieved themselves in an outdoor privy. One of Jimmy’s first chores was milking the cows. </p><p>Jimmy exerted himself to learn all he could about running a farm. Even so, he harbored an ambition to go to sea one day. He set his sights on Annapolis and a career as a naval officer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>He was 16 when he graduated from Plains High School at the top of his class of 26 — the first in his family to finish high school.

Then, in 1943, with the United States far into World War II, he was accepted into the Naval Academy at 19. He spent the rest of the war there in an accelerated program and graduated in 1946.</p><p>A month later he married Rosalynn Smith, a friend of his sister Ruth’s. Rosalynn had briefly attended Georgia Southwestern and was ready to leave Georgia.</p><p>The Navy gave the Carters a look at the world.

Nixon</a> in November. Mr. Carter and his advisers calculated that the Democratic field in 1976 would be wide open and that a newcomer would have a chance.</p><p>He was encouraged by Peter Bourne, a British psychiatrist who had landed in Georgia and joined Mr. Carter’s staff to work on health matters. Dr. Bourne had written a 10-page memorandum to Mr. Carter during the 1972 Democratic National Convention, when Mr. Carter had hopes of being Mr. McGovern’s running mate. Dr. Bourne urged him to aim higher than vice president and to start campaigning for the presidency early. Mr. Jordan wrote a similar memo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>Dr. Bourne’s optimism was based on the presumption that a Carter campaign would signal a departure from the old politics of race. “No Southerner has captured the presidency,” Dr. Bourne wrote, “because he has not been willing to take the drastic step away from traditional Southern politics that is necessary.” </p><p>Mr. Carter was willing and able to take that step because of a new Southern political reality that had been fostered by the civil rights movement and Johnson’s leadership in dismantling the legal underpinnings of Jim Crow, including the disenfranchisement of Black voters. No longer necessarily tethered to that segregationist legacy, white Southerners could henceforth run for national office on an equal footing with others, although for years they would have to demonstrate that they were not racists.</p><p>The day after Mr. McGovern’s resounding defeat, Mr. Carter summoned several advisers to the Georgia governor’s mansion to begin planning his presidential run. The group assumed that his main rivals for the Democratic nomination in 1976 would be Wallace and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Wallace was recovering from wounds at the hands of a would-be assassin earlier that year. By Christmas 1972, the Carter campaign was quietly underway.</p><p>Two months later, Mr. Carter spoke to the National Press Club in Washington, laying out a vision for the nation that combined populism, frugality and criticism of Nixon, the latter a note that would sound prescient during the unfolding Watergate scandal just ahead.</p><p>Mr. Carter recognized that he was weak on foreign affairs at the time. So in April 1973, he and Rosalynn Carter brushed up on their Spanish and led a delegation of Georgians on a trade mission to Latin America. A month later, he and his group were in Britain, West Germany, Belgium and Israel. He accepted an appointment to the Trilateral Commission, which had been created by the banker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/business/david-rockefeller-dead-chase-manhattan-banker.html" title="Times obituary">David Rockefeller</a> in 1973 as a forum for political and business figures from North America, Western Europe and Japan.

He cited the “misery index,” the combination of inflation and unemployment rates, which reached 13 percent by Election Day. On Nov. 2, 1976, Mr. Carter defeated Ford with 297 electoral votes to 240, and 50.1 percent of the popular vote to 48 percent for the incumbent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-53"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carter in July 1976 with his family on the podium at Madison Square Garden in New York during the Democratic National Convention.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William E.

In addition to walking the route of his inaugural parade, he banned the playing of “Hail to the Chief,” sold the presidential yacht Sequoia and carried his own bags onto Air Force One.</p><p>Mr. Carter’s first act as president was to grant amnesty to Vietnam War draft resisters. The predicted firestorm raged then quickly faded. He had fulfilled his first campaign promise, part of his plan to bind up the nation’s wounds. Warned that the order would be fiercely opposed in the Senate, as indeed it was, he replied: “I don’t care if all 100 of them are against me. It’s the right thing to do.”</p><p>Mr. Carter immediately tried to allay any lingering doubts about his stand on race. One of his first appointments, ambassador to the United Nations, was Mr. Young, his Atlanta friend and a former aide to the Rev.

During the Iran hostage crisis, the face of Hodding Carter (no relation to Jimmy Carter) became almost as familiar on television as the president’s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-58"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Two days after taking office in January 1977, Mr. Carter embraced Jean Young at a White House reception for her husband, Andrew Young, right, who was the president’s choice to be ambassador to the United Nations.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-29"><div><p>The president himself was on television almost daily in his first months in office. He held news conferences twice a month and addressed “town meetings” around the country. In his televised “fireside chats” — reminiscent of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s radio addresses from the White House — he spoke to the citizenry wearing a fatherly cardigan sweater rather than a suit. He answered questions on a national radio broadcast.</p><p>Surrounded by the “Georgia Mafia” he had taken with him to the White House, Mr. Carter refused at first to have a chief of staff, preferring what was called a “spokes of the wheel” structure in which many advisers had access to him. As it turned out, he was a micromanager, drawing scorn for keeping tabs even on the schedule of the White House tennis court.</p><p>Part of his problem could be traced to a cultural gap between Mr. Carter’s team and the Washington sophisticates who set the tone in national affairs. The Southerners, wearing bluejeans to work and acting boisterous in public after hours, were greeted skeptically in some quarters and often ridiculed.</p><p>The Washington Star saluted the new administration with a page of mocking cartoons by Patrick Oliphant.

In London, the humor magazine Punch published a weekly column titled “Miz Lillian Writes,” composed in an exaggerated Southern patois. The president’s mother was portrayed as a crude racist, though she was perhaps the oldest white integrationist in Plains.</p><p>The administration had its first hint of scandal in September 1977, when Mr. Lance, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and a close Carter friend, was forced to resign after allegations of civil fraud and numerous violations of banking and securities laws during his Atlanta days. A federal jury later acquitted him and his associates on nine counts of banking law violations but deadlocked on three other counts.</p><p>In response to criticism that his presidency was all style and no substance, Mr. Carter proposed tax reform, an overhaul of the welfare system and a comprehensive approach to the energy problem. He offered policies to halt the decline of cities, tackled inflation and unemployment, and sought increased spending for guns and butter while preaching the necessity of a balanced budget.</p><p>His foreign affairs list was just as long: disarmament; a new international respect for human rights; meaningful dialogue with developing nations; closer ties with Latin America; resolution of the Middle East conflict; better relations with the Soviet Union; and, presaging his first big fight with Congress, the pair of treaties turning over the Panama Canal to Panama.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-31"><div><p>The upshot was that he overloaded Congress with proposals. “The president personally tries to solve too many problems,” Attorney General <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/washington/06bell.html" title="Times obituary ">Griffin B. Bell</a> said when he resigned in 1979 to return to private law practice. “The president can’t spend his time on minutiae. He’s got to deal with the big things, like inflation.” </p><h2 id="link-67514daf">‘Sacrifice and Pain’</h2><p>Despite his infectious smile, Mr. Carter was an introvert at heart and faced policy challenges like an engineer, not a politician. He could be priggish and even moralistic. He made little allowance for the political needs of his own allies, alienating fellow Democrats in Congress, especially the House speaker, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/obituaries/thomas-p-o-neill-jr-a-democratic-power-in-the-house-for-decades-dies-at-81.html" title="Times obituary ">Thomas P. O’Neill</a> of Massachusetts. Mr. Carter “did not like politicians and felt uncomfortable with the normal byplay of political compromise,” Mr. Eizenstat wrote in his 2018 book. </p><p>As a result, Mr. Carter’s legislative record was mixed. He created a Department of Energy and a Department of Education, both of which would go on to survive generations of Republicans who vowed to eliminate them. But other proposals, like a wellhead tax on new oil, went down to defeat.</p><p>Circumstances outside his control made matters worse. The Iranian revolution in late 1978 cut oil production in Iran and increased energy problems in the United States. There were long lines at gasoline stations. To alleviate the pain, Mr. Carter, by executive action, ended controls on the price of domestically produced oil.</p><p>Stung by criticism that he did not appreciate the ways of Washington, the president changed his style during the spring of 1978. He reined in freewheeling cabinet officers and put more power in the White House. He gave senior White House staff members more authority, overcoming his initial fear of creating another Nixon White House. He reluctantly decided to grasp the levers of power and play the political game.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-32"><div><p>By the end of his second year, Mr. Carter had succeeded in pushing through a Democratic-controlled Congress a tax cut, Civil Service reorganization and an energy bill that had been significantly changed from his original proposal. He vetoed bills for public works and the military that he deemed “inflationary.”</p><p>But Congress refused to act on other initiatives, including parts of his urban aid programs and his plan to scrap welfare programs in favor of a system of cash grants for those who were not expected to work.</p><p>He tried to balance the budget. He also wanted to increase military spending, so he proposed cutting social programs, but that provoked warnings of social unrest from members of Congress and leaders of Black organizations. The criticism was only partly blunted by his appointment of more Black and Hispanic people than any president before him.</p><p>Mr. Carter took strong environmental stands, but problems persisted in hazardous wastes, water resources, wildlife protection and coastal conservation. After a partial meltdown of a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and a subsequent radiation leak — the worst civilian nuclear accident in American history — Mr. Carter traveled to the plant to reassure the nation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-67"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The president toured the control room of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in April 1979 days after it became the scene of the worst civilian nuclear accident in American history.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-33"><div><p>The president’s political problems worsened by the middle of his term. In the summer of 1979 he spent 10 days at Camp David, the Maryland presidential retreat, conducting a “domestic summit,” listening to advice from 150 prominent Americans. He returned to Washington and delivered an Oval Office address on what he termed “a crisis of confidence” in the nation. What became known as his <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/carter-crisis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“malaise” speech</a> — although he did not use that word — lifted his popularity briefly but came to be derided as preachy and downbeat, seeming to define what many considered the uninspiring tone of his presidency.</p><p>Two days after the speech, Mr. Carter asked his entire cabinet to submit resignations. He accepted five. The shake-up set off an uproar in Congress. Some critics, including Democrats, suggested that he had undercut confidence in the government; even Mr. Mondale was so distressed that he briefly contemplated resigning.</p><p>Mr. Carter’s response to the criticism was the time-honored device of blaming the news media. From the beginning, there had been antagonism between the Washington press corps and the Carter outsiders. Late in his administration, he held more “town meetings” around the country and began meeting with out-of-town reporters and editors to circumvent the capital news media.</p><p>But broadly speaking, “Carter’s message was sacrifice and pain,” Mr. Eizenstat wrote. During an address to the nation on the energy crisis, the president opened by saying, “Tonight I want to have an <em>unpleasant </em>talk with you about a problem that is unprecedented in our history.” When celebrating the creation of the Education Department, he said dolefully, “This thing won’t work as well as you think it will.”</p><p>It was not as if his presidency was without successes. Eight months after he took office, he and the leader of Panama, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/02/obituaries/panama-leader-killed-in-crash-in-bad-weather.html" title="">Omar Torrijos</a>, signed treaties obliging the United States to surrender control of the Panama Canal by 1999, settling a longstanding point of friction between the two countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-34"><div><p>Mr. Carter saw the move as an overdue show of American resolve “to deal with the developing nations of the world, the small nations of the world, on the basis of mutual respect and partnership.”</p><p>But led by Mr. Reagan, conservatives denounced the treaties as a giveaway. “We built it, we paid for it, it’s ours, and we’re going to keep it,” Mr. Reagan said. Gallup found that 78 percent of Americans opposed the treaties.</p><p>Mr. Carter campaigned for the measures in the classic style, cajoling, twisting arms and inviting senators to the White House. He also went over their heads with a publicity blitz aimed at voters. In March 1978, he won with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/19/archives/new-jersey-pages-senate-votes-to-give-up-panama-canal-carter.html" title="">Senate vote of 68 to 32</a>, one more than the two-thirds required for ratification.</p><p>His next foreign affairs triumph came more easily. Mr. Carter signaled early in his presidency that he wished to complete the normalization of relations with China that had started with Nixon’s diplomatic breakthrough. To establish full-fledged embassies and increase trade, Mr. Carter embarked on months of secret, delicate negotiations.</p><p>The two nations reached an agreement on the main obstacle, the status of Taiwan, which China regarded as a renegade province. The United States severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and withdrew its military presence there, but also insisted on continuing arms sales, commercial trade and other ties on an unofficial basis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-35"><div><p>Mr. Carter and the Chinese leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/20/world/deng-xiaoping-is-dead-at-92-architect-of-modern-china.html" title="">Deng Xiaoping</a>, announced the agreement on Dec. 15, 1978. Some conservatives objected, but the normalization seemed to please most Americans. Formal recognition took place on New Year’s Day 1979. Mr. Deng visited Washington that January.</p><h2 id="link-663c4a78">A Historic Handshake</h2><p>Mr. Carter’s pursuit of a Middle East peace settlement was an even more momentous venture in personal diplomacy. He invited Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/07/world/sadat-assassinated-army-parade-men-amid-ranks-fire-into-stands-vice-president-041350.html" title="">President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt</a> to Camp David in September 1978 for what would become 13 days of dramatic negotiations to end decades of conflict between their nations.</p><p>The talks began in gloom and discord and almost broke down several times, only to be salvaged by Mr. Carter’s persistence in finding a way to continue. Ultimately, the leaders emerged with what was billed as a “framework for peace.” As the world watched in disbelief, Mr. Carter hosted a White House ceremony with a smiling Mr. Begin and Mr. Sadat.</p><p>Mr. Begin and Mr. Sadat returned home to growing dissent, however. The framework projected a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and self-rule for Palestinians on the West Bank of the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip. Israel was to return Egyptian territory in the Sinai Peninsula that it had seized in their 1973 war. But negotiations bogged down on the details.</p><p>Mr. Carter stepped in again. Mr. Begin returned to Washington for more talks and agreed to break the deadlock. Mr. Carter flew to Cairo to get Mr. Sadat’s approval, then to Jerusalem for Mr. Begin’s final assent for what would be known as the Camp David Accords. While the Palestinian piece of the negotiation would remain unresolved, the image of Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin shaking hands with a grinning Mr. Carter at <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0326.html?module=inline" title="">the peace treaty signing</a> would become one of the most enduring images of the era.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-75"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The image of Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Menachem Begin of Israel shaking hands with a grinning Mr. Carter at the signing of the Camp David Accords became one of the most enduring images of the Carter presidency.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bob Daugherty/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-36"><div><p>The agreement brought Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1978. Mr. Carter, the architect of the settlement, was passed over on a technicality: He had not been nominated in time. He was to wait 24 years for the honor.</p><p>One of Mr. Carter’s biggest foreign policy disappointments was his failure to finalize a new Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, or SALT, treaty with the Soviet Union, something he had pledged to do when he took office. The first SALT agreement, signed in 1972, was to expire in 1977.</p><p>Negotiations got off to a rocky start. Mr. Carter had criticized human rights violations in the Soviet Union, but he instructed Secretary of State Vance to persist, and on June 18, 1979, in Vienna, the new SALT II treaty limiting each side’s nuclear bombers and missiles was signed by Mr. Carter and the Soviet premier, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/world/brezhnev-dead-at-75-no-successor-named-reagan-pledges-an-effort-to-improve-ties.html" title="Times obituary ">Leonid I. Brezhnev</a>.</p><p>Then, during a bitter, protracted debate about the treaty in the Senate, the issue was suddenly removed from the table by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, making approval impossible. On Jan. 3, 1980, Mr. Carter reluctantly asked the Senate to delay the ratification process. It never resumed, and in 1986, Mr. Reagan, then president, formally repudiated the treaty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-37"><div><p>Mr. Carter later called the failure of the SALT negotiations “the most profound disappointment of my presidency.”</p><p>He responded to the invasion by ordering an embargo on sales of grain and high technology to the Soviet Union and by persuading the United States Olympic Committee to boycott the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow. Both actions elicited protests at home, especially from farmers over the grain embargo.</p><p>To address human rights, a theme of his Inaugural Address, Mr. Carter hired a group of strong rights advocates led by Ms. Derian, the assistant secretary of state for human rights, who was known for standing up to the segregationist power structure in Mississippi. In her new job, she traveled the world confronting dictators and demanding an end to torture and other abuses.</p><p>But Mr. Carter soon learned that change could be difficult. There were tensions over ideology. Some rights advocates wanted to attack the violations of right-wing dictators; others saw the abuses by Communist nations as more pernicious.</p><p>The administration ultimately drew back from its confrontation with the Soviet Union over human rights but pursued the campaign in Latin America and Africa, cutting military aid to Argentina, Uruguay and Ethiopia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-38"><div><p>How much Mr. Carter advanced the cause of human rights is difficult to gauge. There is no doubt, however, that he made the issue more visible beyond the American borders.</p><h2 id="link-b533003">The Hostage Crisis</h2><p>On Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000001479298/american-hostages-taken-in-iran.html" title="">seized the United States Embassy</a> in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage.

One plan after another was discarded.

He also lost Mr. Vance, his valued secretary of state, who had counseled against the mission and resigned in protest four days later.

It was one final indignity inflicted on him by Tehran, which had delayed their departure until after Mr. Reagan took the oath of office.</p><p>The hostage crisis reverberated for years. Some in the Carter camp were convinced that the Reagan campaign had made a secret deal with the Iranians in 1980 to keep the hostages in Tehran until after the election.

According to Mr. Barnes, Mr. Connally told multiple regional leaders to urge Iran to hold the captives until after the American vote.

But both ran out of steam before the convention in August at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>In Mr. Reagan and his running mate, George H.W. Bush, the Democrats faced a formidable ticket. Mr. Reagan, a former actor and California governor, was one of America’s most skilled users of television, and his sunny vision of America as a “shining city on a hill” contrasted with Mr. Carter’s view of a troubled country.</p><p>Mr. Reagan pursued a Southern strategy of driving a wedge between the region’s increasingly conservative white voters and a Democratic Party that had shifted to the left on civil rights and other issues. Mr. Reagan kicked off his Southern campaign with a speech at the Neshoba County Fair, just outside Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights workers were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in 1964.</p><p>Throughout the campaign, the nation watched the spectacle of Cuban refugees, many of them criminals turned out of jail by President Fidel Castro, flooding into the United States and creating turmoil. Among those upset was the young Democratic governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, who would later attribute his own re-election defeat in 1980 to Mr. Carter’s decision to house many of the Cubans at Fort Chaffee, in Mr. Clinton’s state, where they rioted in June.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-44"><p>Another distraction was Mr. Carter’s younger brother, Billy, who had registered as a foreign agent. He had accepted a $220,000 loan from Libya to try to get its oil on the United States market. His financial dealings were investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department, and while no charges were filed, the publicity caused problems for the Carter campaign. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-94"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carter and Ronald Reagan after a televised presidential debate on Oct. 28, 1980, a week before the election.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Madeline Drexler/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-45"><div><p>Mr. Carter ignored the third candidate in the race, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/john-anderson-who-ran-against-reagan-and-carter-in-1980-is-dead-at-95.html" title="">Representative John B. Anderson</a>, a Republican from Illinois running as an independent, and met Mr. Reagan for a debate in Cleveland on Oct. 28, just a week before the election. The president demonstrated command of the issues, but Mr. Reagan outflanked him with a genial demeanor that belied the warmonger image promoted by Democrats.</p><p>When Mr. Carter presented him as a radical right-winger who would gut Medicare and Social Security, Mr. Reagan defused the attack by shaking his head as if in disappointment. “There you go again,” he said.</p><p>But along with the Iran hostage crisis, perhaps the most important factor in Mr. Carter’s undoing was the dismal state of the economy. Mr. Reagan turned the “misery index,” which had <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-misery-index-hit-a-59-year-low-so-why-are-we-still-miserable-2015-10-15" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reached 22 percent</a>, against Mr. Carter and summed up his case at the debate with the cutting question, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-46"><div><p>The answer for many Americans was no. On Nov. 4, 1980, Mr. Reagan won in a landslide, capturing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/upshot/50-years-%3Ctempdel%20style%20=%20&#39;visibility:hidden;&#39;%3Eo%3C/tempdel%3E%3Ctempdel%20style%20=%20&#39;visibility:hidden;&#39;%3Ef%3C/tempdel%3E-electoral-college-maps-how-the-us-turned-red-and-blue.html" title="">489 electoral votes</a> to 49 for Mr. Carter, who won just six states and the District of Columbia. In the popular vote, Mr. Reagan received 51 percent to 41 percent for Mr. Carter; Mr. Anderson finished with 7 percent.</p><h2 id="link-63c685ad">After the White House</h2><p>Recovering from the voters’ painful rejection, Mr. and Mrs. Carter, in time, began to build a new life. They moved back to Plains to the first and only house they had ever owned, a modest one-story rancher valued in 2018 at just $167,000 — a figure that The Washington Post noted was less than the cost of the armored Secret Service vehicles parked outside day and night.</p><p>Shortly after returning to Georgia, the Carters learned that the peanut operation, which had been placed in a blind trust, was in debt by more than $1 million. They sold it to the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, the farm-products conglomerate, but kept 2,000 acres of farmland, along with their house and its accompanying 170 acres.</p><p>The Carters fished, hiked and went to church. Mr. Carter learned to ski at age 62. He climbed Mount Fuji at 70. Both he and Mrs. Carter wrote memoirs, and Mr. Carter went on to write 32 books, mainly extended essays on public policy but also an inspirational volume, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/08/us/reporter-s-notebook-tips-from-jimmy-carter-on-living-well-in-old-age.html" title="">The Virtues of Aging</a>” (1998); a novel, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/23/books/founding-bubbas.html" title="">The Hornet’s Nest</a>” (2003), set during the Revolutionary War; and a children’s book, “The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer” (2014), illustrated by his daughter, Amy.</p><p>Of all his books, the most controversial was “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/books/review/Bronner.t.html" title="">Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid</a>” (2006), which compared Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians to South Africa’s former system of racial repression. The book generated a backlash among Israel’s supporters, and 14 members of the Carter Center advisory board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/us/12carter.html" title="">resigned in protest</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-47"><div><p>Mr. Carter’s final book, published in 2018 by Simon &amp; Schuster, was “Faith: A Journey for All,” a reflection on the role of faith in his life. He also wrote poetry, taught at Emory University in Atlanta and led Sunday school classes at his local church every other week.</p><p>But in leaving the White House at age 56, Mr. Carter resolved to do more than write books and build a presidential library. “What Carter really wanted was to find some way to continue the unfinished business of his presidency,” the historian Douglas Brinkley wrote in <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/07/reviews/980607.07hodgsot.html" title="">“The Unfinished Presidency:</a> Jimmy Carter’s Journey Beyond the White House” (1998). </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-100"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carter doing well-publicized carpentry work as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.

They spent one week a year wielding hammers and saws to build houses for the poor, and as of 2019 the former president had helped renovate nearly 4,400 homes in 14 countries with his own tool belt. He also launched an effort to eliminate Guinea worm in Africa, a disease that afflicted 3.5 million people a year when he started but was detected <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/health/guinea_worm/case-totals.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just seven times this year</a> through November.</p><p>Mr. Carter developed an easy camaraderie with Gerald Ford, and they collaborated on a variety of post-presidential pursuits, including a joint call in 1998 for Congress to censure Mr. Clinton rather than impeach him for lying under oath to cover up his affair with a White House intern. By the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html" title="">Mr. Ford died</a> in 2006, they had become such good friends that Mr. Ford requested that Mr. Carter speak at a memorial service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-103"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carter at age 86 on a Habitat for Humanity project in Washington, D.C., in 2010.

He fumed that Mr. Reagan had reversed many of his policies on the environment and human rights, and the Carters bristled at never being invited to the Reagan White House for a state dinner. He was a vocal critic of the Iraq invasion of 2003 and called George W. Bush’s administration at the time the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/washington/22carter.html?module=inline" title="">“worst in history.”</a></p><p>At the heart of Mr. Carter’s post-presidency was his ambition to be a peacemaker. In 1989, he led a team in monitoring the elections in Panama and denounced them as fraudulent. The next year, he monitored elections in Nicaragua that resulted in the ouster of the Sandinista government, accomplishing at the ballot box what Mr. Reagan had been unable to do on the battlefield with the contra rebels.</p><p>In the following years Mr. Carter traveled the globe mediating conflicts in regions from Asia to the Caribbean and pushing to improve global public health and human rights. Mr. Clinton, who had rebounded from his setback in 1980 and captured the presidency in 1992, sent Mr. Carter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/us/politics/colin-powell-dead.html" title="">Gen. Colin L. Powell</a> and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia to Haiti in 1994 to persuade a military junta there to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. They did.</p><p>Throughout his post-presidency, Mr. Carter involved himself in Middle Eastern and arms control issues, sometimes nettling American administrations, both Republican and Democratic. Despite friction over the private diplomacy, Mr. Clinton in 1999 presented Mr. and Mrs. Carter with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/10/us/clinton-gives-medals-and-compliments-to-the-carters.html" title="">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, the highest civilian award in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-106"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carter greeting Kim Yong Nam, president of North Korea’s People’s Assembly, in Pyongyang in 2010.

His doctors had noticed a mass on his liver in the spring of 2015 while examining Mr. Carter after he had returned from a trip to Guyana with a cold.</p><p>Announcing his brain cancer at a news conference, he struck many as unusually candid for a former president.

When Mr. Carter was not well enough to attend the inauguration, Mr. Biden made a point of visiting him in Georgia weeks later.</p><p>In the four decades since Mr. Carter left the White House, no other sitting president had paid him the respect of coming to see him in Plains, making Mr. Biden’s visit something of a symbolic embrace that reflected evolving views of the defeated president-turned-elder-statesman.</p><p>“He showed us throughout his entire life what it means to be a public servant, with emphasis on the word servant,” Mr. Biden said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9m1wL_EzhY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video tribute</a> issued at that time. Addressing his predecessor, Mr. Biden added: “President Carter, you’ve shown us what we can be as individuals, as a nation — courageous, compassionate and humble.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
