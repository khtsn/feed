Trump’s top surrogates in Michigan were onstage in a Grand Rapids arena, distilling the choice in the campaign into a stark and striking message.</p><p>“Choose peace over war,” urged Mayor Amer Ghalib of Hamtramck, Mich.</p><p>Democrats, suggested Mayor Bill Bazzi of Dearborn Heights, Mich., were “a bunch of warmongers.”</p><p>And former Representative Mike Rogers, the Republican Senate candidate, welcomed “our Christian Arab friends, our Muslim Arab friends” and declared, “We all want a path to peace.”</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, “for being part of that coalition.”</p><p>It is an extraordinary new coalition. Along the way to his decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, Mr. Trump drew at least some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/dearborn-michigan-trump-arab-voters.html" title="">Arab American and Muslim voters</a> who are outraged by the Biden administration’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza.

And both strongly pro-Israel Trump voters and some of Mr. Trump’s Arab American backers are skeptical that his ascent this week is the start of a durable cross-ideological, interfaith coalition.</p><p>For Mr. Trump, the question is whether he can keep both happy — or if he will even try.</p><p>“This was not even a shotgun wedding — it was a blind-date wedding,” James Zogby, a founder of the Arab American Institute in Washington and a longtime member of the Democratic National Committee, said of Mr. Trump’s new support from Arab Americans and Muslims. Mr. Zogby said many of those voters backed the former president to protest the Biden administration’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza, not to affirm his campaign. He anticipated that Mr. Trump would “pursue policies that will make them more furious.”</p><p>“The more they see what’s going to happen, the less enchanted they’ll be,” he said of Arab Americans. “I don’t expect the right wing in the Jewish community to be disappointed at all, unfortunately.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Amer Ghalib of Hamtramck, Mich., with Mr. Trump at a campaign office in the city last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Broadly speaking, American Jews tend to strongly favor Democrats.

In a speech in Pittsburgh shortly before Election Day, Ms. Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, warned that if Mr. Trump thought it was in his interests, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/doug-emhoff-antisemitism-speech-jewish-voters.html" title="">he “would turn his back on Israel and the Jewish people on a dime.”</a></p><p>Some Trump supporters from both the Jewish and the Arab American and Muslim communities acknowledged the obvious tensions now at play.</p><p>“I do have concern that these American Arabs, Dearborn Arabs, will try to pressure Trump to have Israel stop the defensive war before they complete their mission,” said Morton A. Klein, who heads the Zionist Organization of America.</p><p>But he expressed hope that the president-elect and his advisers would reach a different conclusion about Israel’s approach to the war in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“He would never agree with these positions, I don’t believe,” Mr. Klein said.</p><p>Ms. Luqman, in Dearborn, expressed similar

that are in the Republican Party.”</p><p>And in one sign that this unusual coalition may be fleeting, she said she still did not consider herself a Republican.</p><p>“They keep telling me, ‘You
