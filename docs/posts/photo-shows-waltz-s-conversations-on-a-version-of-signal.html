When zoomed in, the photograph clearly shows what was on his phone screen: a list of his conversations on what appears to be a modified version of the messaging app Signal.</p><p>The contents of the screen indicate that Mr. Waltz had been in conversation with several top Trump administration officials: Vice President JD Vance; Tulsi Gabbard, the national intelligence director; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/michael-waltz-signal-leak-trump.html" title="">announced</a> as Mr. Waltz’s interim replacement on Thursday. Snippets of some messages are visible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Waltz appeared to be using a modified version of Signal sold by <a href="https://www.telemessage.com/tag/tm-sgnl-android-installation-upgrade-guide/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TeleMessage</a> that retains copies of messages to comply with government rules around preserving records, as first reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/mike-waltz-accidentally-reveals-obscure-app-the-government-is-using-to-archive-signal-messages/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">404 Media</a>. The screen shows a request for him to verify his “TM SGNL PIN.” Time stamps indicate that the communications were as recent as the morning of the cabinet meeting.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The screen of Mr. Waltz’s phone indicated that he had been in conversation with several top Trump administration officials.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In response to reports of the photo, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, said in a <a href="https://x.com/StevenCheung47/status/1918052142050390152" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X that “Signal is an approved app that is loaded onto our government phones.” Smarsh, the Portland company that owns TeleMessage, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Still, the moment prompted more questions over the handling of potentially sensitive information by a top security official. Mr. Waltz has been under scrutiny since the revelation in March that he accidentally included a journalist when he set up a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/signal-group-chat-key-figures.html" title="">group chat</a> on Signal to discuss details of a military operation in Yemen.</p><p>Democrats at the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/democrats-hegseth-waltz-resign-signal.html" title="">called</a> for the resignations of Mr. Waltz and Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, citing the recklessness of discussing sensitive defense information outside secure government channels.</p><p>Aides have said that President Trump did not want to be seen as giving in to the news media by firing Mr. Waltz at the time. On Thursday, the president removed Mr. Waltz from his security role and nominated him to be ambassador to the United Nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump has discouraged his staff from using Signal, which encrypts messages but is not approved for sensitive government communications. “I think we learned: Maybe don’t use Signal, OK?” he said in an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/donald-trump-oval-office-interview-excerpts/682623/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with The Atlantic last month. “I would frankly tell these people not to use Signal, although it’s been used by a lot of people.”</p><p>Earlier, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/politics/trump-signal-leak-war-plans.html" title="">downplayed</a> concerns over the Signal leak, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-hegseth-signal-chat-leak.html" title="">dismissed</a> concerns over sharing attack plans on the app as a “waste of time.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabella Kwai is a Times reporter based in London, covering breaking news and other trends.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
