Mr. Dutton channeled parts of Mr. Trump’s messaging, railing against diversity initiatives, pledging to cut tens of thousands of government jobs and floating the idea of <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/dutton-citizenship-referendum-leaves-liberals-fuming/105068674" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revoking citizenship</a> for dual nationals who have been convicted of a crime.</p><p>But political winds have shifted in Australia, buffeted by the global tumult unleashed by Mr. Trump, if to a far lesser extent than they did in another U.S. ally, Canada. Even though Australia hasn’t been in Mr. Trump’s crosshairs the same way Canada has, the <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/election-2025-youd-rather-be-albanese-than-dutton-but-its-not-going-to-be-easy/news-story/7c5878257d0f07f0bfcd6811c86dd64e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest</a> <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/labor-holds-its-lead-as-time-runs-short-for-a-liberal-rebound-poll-reveals-20250429-p5luz8.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">political</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/29/guardian-essential-poll-labor-leads-coalition-in-final-pre-election-poll-as-duttons-approval-rating-slips-further" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveys</a> in Australia show Labor has pulled ahead of Mr. Dutton’s conservative Liberal Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We are Canada-lite. We don’t have the same exposure, but Trump is very unpopular among the Australian public,” said Darren Lim, a senior lecturer in politics and international relations at the Australian National University. “The U.S. plays a large role in our conception of where we are in the world.”</p><p>Mr. Trump plans to impose a 10 percent levy on most Australian imports, the base line rate of his so-called reciprocal tariffs, in addition to 25 percent on its steel and aluminum exports. During the campaign, both Mr. Albanese and Mr. Dutton have faced repeated questions on how they would manage the relationship with Washington. Responding to a question during their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT0t6zdAknk&amp;ab_channel=7NEWSAustralia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">final debate on Sunday</a>, both said that they trusted Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, campaigning at a market in Nowra on Tuesday.

A <a href="https://poll.lowyinstitute.org/report/2025/pre-election-release/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent poll by the Lowy Institute</a> showed the Australian public’s trust in the United States had sunk to its lowest point in two decades, with two-thirds saying they either had not very much or no trust at all in their country’s most important ally. Voters were evenly split on whether Mr. Albanese or Mr. Dutton would be better at managing relations with Mr. Trump.</p><p>In recent weeks, Mr. Dutton has tried to distance himself from Mr. Trump. By the time a political ally of his <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/peter-dutton-sidesteps-jacinta-prices-make-australia-great-again-pledge/y4kzb4oct" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uttered the words</a> “make Australia great again” in mid-April, it was clear any association with Mr. Trump was a liability Mr. Dutton wanted to avoid.

It’s a stark contrast to 2022, when the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, had his name <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/15/australia/australia-election-xi-jinping-china-relations-intl-hnk-dst/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeatedly invoked</a> and his face plastered on election billboards. A spat over the origins of the coronavirus pandemic led to a downward spiral of relations between the two countries, with China charging as much as a 218.4 percent tax on Australian bottled wine.</p><p>Mr. Dutton, whose Liberal Party is in a longstanding coalition with the more conservative National Party, has dramatically toned down the tenor of how he speaks about China, even <a href="https://peterdutton.com.au/leader-of-the-opposition-transcript-interview-with-chris-okeefe-2gb-3/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">describing himself as “pro-China”</a> last year.
