    <h1>Trump Calls Gaza a ‘Big Real Estate Site,’ Reiterating Plan for U.S. Takeover</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Sunday, as Mr. Trump was traveling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/one-more-stop-on-a-busy-presidential-day-the-super-bowl.html" title="">to attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans</a>, he raised the proposal again.</p><p>“Think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it,” he said of Gaza, according to an audio recording from Air Force One that was shared with reporters.</p><p>“There won’t be anybody there,” Mr. Trump added. “Hamas won’t be there,” he said, referring to the militant group that led the assault on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that touched off the war in Gaza. “We’ll be building through other of the very rich countries in the Middle East; they’ll be building some beautiful sites for the people, the Palestinians, to live in,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu, at a government meeting in Israel on Sunday, praised Mr. Trump’s vision for the region following the war. “There are opportunities for possibilities that I think we never dreamed of, or at least a few months ago they did not seem possible — but they are possible,” he said.</p><p>“President Trump came with a completely different vision,” for the future of Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu said, “much better for the State of Israel, a revolutionary and creative vision, which we are discussing. He is very determined to carry it out.”</p></div></div>
