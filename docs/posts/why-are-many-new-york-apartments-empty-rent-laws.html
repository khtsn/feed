Who? They had a player named pxsl-- Kid busted his ass outta the cesspool wasteland of Faceit, grindin every day, and somebody actually looked at him and and said: yes, I will pay you to play cs for this team. Welcome. 

Meanwhile, you’re getting tilted eatin leftover pizza from the fridge playing mirage on faceit for the 8th time in a row.</p>

                            <p>AM Gaming only exists to „showcase“ players from AM player agency. Hyped also isn’t a part of that agency. But he isn’t in any agency from what I can see so he might join.

But they’ll probably just drop the German core idea altogether. There’s just no point. German scene is dead and the 300 viewers of Dachcs really don’t justify it either :/</p>
