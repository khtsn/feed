Analysts said Mr. Ishiba could struggle to survive in the long term, putting Japan at risk of returning to a revolving door of prime ministers just as it prepares to grapple with increased unpredictability in the United States, its most important international ally, following the re-election of Donald Trump as president.</p><p>In a runoff election with the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party, Japan’s largest opposition group, Mr. Ishiba defeated Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister, 221 to 160. Mr. Ishiba was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/asia/japan-new-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba.html" title="">elected prime minister</a> in September.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Although the Constitutional Democrats made significant gains in last month’s election, they did not win a majority in the lower house of Parliament, which would have given them the right to select the prime minister. With seven other small opposition parties fielding leadership candidates, Mr. Noda could not amass enough unified support to unseat Mr. Ishiba.</p><p>Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
