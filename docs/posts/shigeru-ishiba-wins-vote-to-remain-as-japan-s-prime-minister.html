Analysts said Mr. Ishiba could struggle to survive in the long term, putting Japan at risk of returning to a revolving door of prime ministers just as it prepares to grapple with increased unpredictability in the United States, its most important international ally, following the re-election of Donald Trump as president.</p><p>In a runoff election with the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party, Japan’s largest opposition group, Mr. Ishiba defeated Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister, 221 to 160. Mr. Ishiba was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/asia/japan-new-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba.html" title="">elected prime minister</a> in September.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Although the Constitutional Democrats made significant gains in last month’s election, they did not win a majority in the lower house of Parliament, which would have given them the right to select the prime minister. With seven other small opposition parties fielding leadership candidates, Mr. Noda could not amass enough unified support to unseat Mr. Ishiba.</p><p>Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Motoko Rich is a reporter in Tokyo, leading coverage of Japan for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/motoko-rich">More about Motoko Rich</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/liberal-democratic-party-japan">Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/yoshihiko-noda">Yoshihiko Noda</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>What Sank the Bayesian?: </strong>A Times investigation has found that a British tech mogul’s superyacht that capsized off Italy had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/world/europe/bayesian-yacht-sinking-italy.html">an unorthodox design that made it vulnerable</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A New Threat to Brazil’s Forests: </strong>Brazilian authorities are using satellites to track deforestation caused by chain saws or fire. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/americas/brazil-forest-amazon-chemicals.html">Now criminals are turning to chemicals to degrade trees — and evade detection</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can Miss Universe Ever Go Home?: </strong>Sheynnis Palacios was the first Nicaraguan to win the crown, becoming a hero in her homeland. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/world/americas/miss-universe-nicaragua.html">Then things got complicated with her country’s authoritarian government</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adopting a New Language: </strong>The Cia-Cia tribe in Indonesia has passed down its language orally for centuries.
