    <h1>How Does Your Facial Hair Make You Feel?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many women have visible facial hair. It can be a part of our appearances from a young age or can increase as we get older. Sometimes it’s caused by hormone imbalances, but in most cases it’s simply a part of life. But despite its prevalence, some women feel shame around it.</p><p>We want to understand your relationship with your facial hair and the spectrum of emotions it may elicit. How has having it as a woman impacted your life? Have you ever gone through removal processes? What do you wish more people understood about facial hair on women? We’re particularly interested if it’s made you think differently about your gender, identity and self-worth.</p><p>We may reach out to hear more about your submission, but we will not publish any part of your response without contacting you first and we will never publicly share your personal information.</p></div></div>
