Trump’s demand that hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel be released from Gaza before his inauguration in January.</p><p>Mr. Trump, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-hostages-inauguration.html" title="">social media post</a> on Monday, did not elaborate on what action would be taken if the captives were not released by Jan. 20, when he will be sworn in. Still, some Israeli officials appeared to be reassured by Mr. Trump’s remarks, which suggested the onus was more on the militants holding the hostages than on Israel to free the captives.</p><p>“I want to thank President Trump for his strong statement yesterday,” Mr. Netanyahu said on Tuesday at a meeting of government ministers. “This is a very decisive statement that clarifies that there is one party responsible for this situation and that is Hamas,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-hostages-inauguration.html" title="">wrote</a> on his Truth Social platform on Monday that “there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity” if the hostages are not released before his inauguration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America,” he said. “RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!”</p><p>According to Israeli authorities, about 250 hostages were captured in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct, 7, 2023, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/hostages-in-gaza-hamas.html" title="">about 100 of them remain in Gaza</a>, with at least a third believed to be dead. Alongside Israel and international mediators, including Qatar and Egypt, the Biden administration has been working toward a cease-fire deal that would include the release of the hostages, although <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">those talks have been stalled for months</a>.</p><p>It was not clear what action Mr. Trump might take to make good on his threat. Over the past year, Israel’s military has killed many of Hamas’s leaders and thousands of its fighters, while reducing much of Gaza to rubble.</p><p>Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s hard-line finance minister who has opposed past proposals for a cease-fire in Gaza, also <a href="https://x.com/bezalelsm/status/1863827483448996287" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">praised Mr. Trump’s comments</a>. Mr. Smotrich has said Israel should not agree to end the war in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed.</p><p>“How refreshing it is to hear clear and morally sound statements that do not create a false equivalence or call for addressing ‘both sides,’” Mr. Smotrich said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“This is the way to bring back the hostages: by increasing the pressure and the costs for Hamas and its supporters, and defeating them, rather than, giving in to their absurd demands,” he added.</p><p>Basem Naim, a Hamas official, said the militant group was seeking a permanent cease-fire and an exchange of Palestinian prisoners for hostages, and blamed Mr. Netanyahu for a lack of progress toward a cease-fire.</p><p>“At many times, we were extremely close to signing on a deal, but due to his savage actions and decisions, these deals broke down,” he said in a statement on Tuesday. He added that Hamas believed Mr. Trump’s message was directed at Mr. Netanyahu and the Israeli government.</p><p>Hamas has long insisted on a permanent end to the war and a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting until Hamas is destroyed in the enclave and has suggested Israeli forces would have to remain in parts of the territory during any cease-fire.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly changed his conditions for a deal with Hamas, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/world/middleeast/israeli-hostages-netanyahu-gaza-ceasefire.html" title="">his critics in Israel</a> have accused him of prioritizing his political survival over freeing the hostages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Benny Gantz, a prominent member of Israel’s political opposition, <a href="https://x.com/gantzbe/status/1863854327447667138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Mr. Trump’s statement</a> was “powerful and important,” and that it was now “time for our brave actions.” His comments appeared to suggest that Israel needed to do more to reach an agreement with Hamas.</p><p>Mr. Gantz has said in the past that <a href="https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/16881961" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Israeli political considerations</a> have contributed to delays in striking a deal, resulting in the deaths of hostages.</p><p>Ameera Harouda<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>American Killed on Oct. 7:</strong> Omer Neutra, an American Israeli dual citizen who fought in the Israeli military and was thought to have been taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/omer-neutra-israel-oct-7-gaza-hamas-hostage.html">was in fact killed on the day of the attack</a>, the military said.</p></li><li><p><strong>World Central Kitchen Worker:</strong> Israel said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-world-central-kitchen.html">killed a World Central Kitchen worker</a> it accused of taking part in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack. “To the best of our knowledge, no WCK team members are affiliated with Hamas,” the aid group said.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Nobody Won’:</strong> Tens of thousands of people who had fled the Lebanese city of Baalbek returned to bombed-out restaurants, flattened apartment buildings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/middleeast/baalbek-lebanon-israel.html">many of the dead still buried under the rubble</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Independent Inquiry Into Oct. 7 Failures:</strong> After the Israeli government delayed a formal investigation into the Hamas attacks, an alliance of survivors and victims’ families set up their own inquiry. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/middleeast/israel-oct-7-inquiry.html">Their scathing findings were released</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rallying Around Netanyahu:</strong> An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-icc-jurisdiction-explained.html">I.C.C. arrest warrant</a> for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spurred <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-icc-warrant.html">outrage across Israel’s political spectrum</a>.
