During a short cease-fire in November 2023, 23 Thai captives were released and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/world/asia/thai-hostages-gaza-home.html" title="">five others</a> were released during another cease-fire this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel believes the bodies of two other Thai citizens, Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Sudthisak Rinthalak, remain in Gaza, according to Yahel Kurlander, a sociologist who has been fighting for the release of Thai hostages.</p><p>The latest hostage retrieval brings the number of remaining living and dead captives believed to still be held in Gaza to 55.
