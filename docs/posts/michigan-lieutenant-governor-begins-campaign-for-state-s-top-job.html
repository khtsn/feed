Gretchen Whitmer over the last six years, presiding over the State Senate, leading a panel that studied racial disparities during the Covid-19 pandemic and signing some bills into law.</p><p>Still, Mr. Gilchrist is not exactly a household name, and with more than a year before the 2026 primaries, he must introduce himself to more voters and compete with other prominent Democrats for endorsements and donors. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/jocelyn-benson-michigan-governor.html" title="">Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson</a>, who has emphasized voting rights and democracy, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/flint-sheriff-protestors-camden-police-ferguson.html" title="">Sheriff Christopher R. Swanson</a> of Genesee County, who spoke at last year’s Democratic National Convention, have already entered the race, and others could follow. Ms. Whitmer is barred by term limits from seeking re-election.</p><p>Michigan’s eventual Democratic nominee could face a difficult three-way race in the general election. Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a longtime Democrat, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/mike-duggan-michigan-governor-detroit-mayor.html" title="">running for governor</a> as an independent, a move that some Democrats worry could give the Republican candidate an advantage. Aric Nesbitt, the Republican leader in the Michigan Senate, is seeking his party’s nomination, and other candidates could still enter that race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In an interview, Mr. Gilchrist, 42, said he planned to focus on housing and health care issues on the campaign trail, though he declined to outline specific policy proposals. He also criticized President Trump’s tariffs, which he said had the potential to “be catastrophic for industries across Michigan,” and described how he would approach governing with Mr. Trump in office.</p><p>“You’ve got to play defense to stop the other team from scoring and hurting people, but you also recognize that sometimes the best defense is a good offense,” Mr. Gilchrist said. “And you’ve got to understand when we can go on the attack and really call out, push back on things in the administration.”</p><p>Ms. Whitmer, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/25/us/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-biden.html" title="">built a national profile</a> after winning a competitive Democratic nominating contest in 2018, <a href="https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32697/michigan_gov_whitmer_won_t_endorse_lt_gov_gilchrist_or_anyone_else_for_governor_in_primary" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has indicated</a> to local reporters that she does not plan to endorse a candidate in next year’s primary. After engaging in repeated disputes with Mr. Trump during his first term, during which she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/us/elections/whitmer-blames-trumps-divisive-rhetoric-for-the-plot-to-kidnap-her.html" title="">tied his rhetoric</a> to a plot to kidnap her, Ms. Whitmer has taken a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/trump-canada-tariffs-whitmer.html" title="">more conciliatory approach</a> this time, signaling a willingness to <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/23/whitmer-talked-tariffs-with-trump-white-house-meeting/79853074007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">work with the president</a> on areas of agreement. </p><p>Michigan is a closely divided state whose voters have supported both Democrats and Republicans in recent years. Last year, Mr. Trump carried the state and Republicans flipped control of the Michigan House of Representatives even as voters elected Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, to the U.S. Senate.</p><p>In addition to selecting a governor, Michigan voters will choose a new senator next year. The Democratic incumbent, Gary Peters, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/gary-peters-michigan-senate-2026.html" title="">not running</a> for another term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Gilchrist, who is married with three children and who would be Michigan’s first Black governor, tied his party’s losses in 2024 to voters who were “mad about the status quo and didn’t feel like Democrats were necessarily, across the board, matching their energy and matching that anger.” He said his candidacy would respond to that frustration.</p><p>“I am a person who is ready to get in there and do something and deliver results and solve problems,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mitch Smith is a Chicago-based national correspondent for The Times, covering the Midwest and Great Plains.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mitch-smith">More about Mitch Smith</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>America’s Role:</strong> Among supporters and detractors alike, President Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/trump-foreign-policy-voters.html">upended old notions about the United States as a global leader</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stephen Bannon vs. Elon Musk:</strong> President Trump has made clear he wants to keep both men and their allies within his movement, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/stephen-bannon-elon-musk-maga.html">the tensions are growing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Schools Brace for Trump:</strong> The Trump Administration’s abrupt withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University cast a pall over at least nine other campuses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/columbia-trump-colleges-antisemitism.html">worried they could be next</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Access to Satellite Imagery:</strong> A Pentagon agency said that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/us-ukraine-satellite-imagery.html">“temporarily suspended” the sharing of satellite imagery</a> with Ukraine in accordance with orders from President Trump.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Contradictions: </strong>Trump’s shifting positions and outright lies have presented the American public with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/politics/trump-third-term-gaza-contradictions.html">dueling narratives at every turn</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
