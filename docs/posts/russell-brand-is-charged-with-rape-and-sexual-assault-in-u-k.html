    <h1>Russell Brand Is Charged With Rape and Sexual Assault in U.K.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday, Mr. Brand posted a video on social media in which he denied ever having committed rape or sexual assault and said he had “never engaged in nonconsensual activity.”</p><p>Mr. Brand added that he was grateful that he would have a chance to defend himself in court.</p><p>The Metropolitan Police in London outlined further details of the charges <a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/russell-brand-charged-by-the-metropolitan-police-service-495944" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a news release on Friday</a>. Mr. Brand is accused of raping a woman in the Bournemouth area, in southern England, in 1999; of indecently assaulting a woman in London in 2001; of orally raping and sexually assaulting a woman in London in 2004; and, between 2004 and 2005, of sexually assaulting a fourth woman in London.</p><p>The police statement added: “The Met’s investigation remains open and detectives ask anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information, to come forward and speak with police.”</p><p>Under British law, it is an offense for news outlets to identify people who make sexual assault allegations unless they choose to waive their right to anonymity.</p><p>Mr. Brand became a star in Britain in the 2000s thanks to acclaimed stand-up shows that often focused on drugs and sex, and that saw him selling out arena dates. He also became known as a TV and radio host for broadcasters including MTV and the BBC. He achieved fame in the United States after starring in movies such as “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Get Him to the Greek,” and through a brief marriage to the singer Katy Perry.</p></div></div>
