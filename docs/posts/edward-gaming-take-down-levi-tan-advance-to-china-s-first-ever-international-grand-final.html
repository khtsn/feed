If passed, it would prohibit K-12 public schools in California from offering foods containing six dyes — Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, Green No. 3, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6 and Red No. 40.</p><p>Between 1963 and 1987, the Food and Drug Administration approved nine synthetic dyes to be used in foods in the United States, and the agency maintains that they are safe.</p><p>Yet some studies have raised concerns that they may have an effect on some children’s behavior.</p><h2 id="link-314d3000">What the Research Suggests</h2><p>In the 1970s, a pediatric allergist from California caught the attention of physicians and parents when <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1977-06105-001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he suggested</a> that a diet without artificial food colors, flavors and preservatives could help treat the <a href="https://www.talkingaboutthescience.com/studies/Feingold-AAP.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">majority of children with A.D.H.D.</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>That was an enthusiastic but exaggerated claim, said Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, a professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral health at the Ohio State University College of Medicine.

In some studies, researchers also measured their concentration skills with computerized tests.</p><p>Early trials were small and had inconsistent results, with some suggesting the dyes increased hyperactivity while others found no effect, Dr. Arnold said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But in two later trials conducted in Britain and <a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/89/6/506.long" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published in 2004</a> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61306-3/abstract" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and 2007</a>, each including about 300 children with or without A.D.H.D. symptoms, researchers found a small but significant increase in hyperactivity when the children consumed juices containing dyes.</p><p>After these studies, European lawmakers began requiring that foods containing certain dyes carry warning labels about their potential effects on children’s attention and activity.</p><p>In 2011, an F.D.A. committee considered requiring similar labels in the United States, but concluded that there wasn’t enough evidence to prove that food dyes caused hyperactivity. It voted against the warnings and recommended more research, yet few studies have been done in the years since, said Dr. Arnold, who summarized the existing research at the 2011 meeting.</p><p>In 2021, state scientists from California <a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/report/health-effects-assessment-potential-neurobehavioral-effects-synthetic-food" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a report</a> that put a new spotlight on food dyes. The team, alongside researchers from the University of California, reviewed 27 mostly small trials in children. The conclusion: Food dyes can interfere with normal behavior in at least some kids.</p><p>Emily Barrett, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health who peer-reviewed the report, said that it was “fair, unbiased and very thorough.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Joel Nigg, a professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health and Science University, performed a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321798/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar review in 2012</a>. He had expected to find evidence that would reassure those who were worried about food dyes, he said. However, he also found a small but significant increase in hyperactivity when children consumed the dyes. Other <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15613992/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers have</a> <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12070991?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">come to</a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169277" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar conclusions</a>.</p><p>Dr. Nigg and other experts have acknowledged the various limitations with the research. In addition to most of the available studies being small, many are also decades old and some rely on parents’ reports of their children’s behaviors, which can be biased. Some also tested dyes that weren’t used in the United States, making it difficult to say if the results apply to children in this country.</p><p>No large, representative studies have been done on children in the United States, Dr. Nigg said. And researchers aren’t sure how, exactly, the dyes might increase hyperactivity; one <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09101529?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study in children</a> suggested that regulation of histamine, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16019-8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">neurotransmitter that can affect behavior</a>, may be involved. In some studies on rodents, researchers have also reported that high levels of the dyes could cause cellular damage and affect signaling and structures in the brain.</p><p>The F.D.A., along with an <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/250277/9789241210003-eng.pdf?sequence=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">international committee of food safety experts</a>, has emphasized the limitations of the research while maintaining that the food dyes currently approved in the United States are safe.</p><p>An F.D.A. spokesman said in a statement that while some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to the dyes, most are not affected. The agency will continue to examine this question, he said. It is also currently <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/17/2023-03391/filing-of-color-additive-petition-from-center-for-science-in-the-public-interest-et-al-request-to" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reviewing the safety of Red Dye No. 3</a>, which will be banned from all foods sold in California starting in 2027 as part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/well/eat/food-additive-ban-california.html" title="">a law signed last year</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The F.D.A.’s approach is to consider the dyes “safe until proven harmful,” Dr. Nigg said. But based on the current evidence, he added, a better strategy would be to prove them safe before they are given to children.</p><p>Frank Yiannas, a former deputy commissioner of food policy at the F.D.A., said in an email that the California bill was a direct result of an “F.D.A. that isn’t moving fast enough” to address consumer concerns.</p><h2 id="link-1580c5c2">Eyes on California</h2><p>Many school districts, health providers, health advocates and democratic and republican lawmakers have <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2316" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backed the bill</a>.</p><p>It also has the support of many parents in California, like Maritza Arguello, 35, who lives in Riverside.
