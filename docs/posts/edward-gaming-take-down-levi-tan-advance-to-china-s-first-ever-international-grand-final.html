</span>, sending the Americas Region&#39;s no. 1 seed down to the lower finals.</p>

<p>The three-map series was played out on Icebox, Lotus, and Abyss. Icebox was Leviátan&#39;s map pick and Lotus was EDG&#39;s map pick, leaving Abyss as the decider. </p>

<p>Leviátan won Icebox 16-14, EDG won Lotus 13-4, and EDG won Abyss 13-11.</p>

<p>Friday&#39;s match was Champions 2024&#39;s first in the 15,000-seat INSPIRE Arena, where the competition&#39;s top four teams will be decided.</p>

<p>Leviátan picked Icebox, a map that had been a favorite of theirs, albeit a shaky one. They had picked it in their last three matches and won all three times, each result going to overtime. EDG began on attack.</p>

<p>The South American side seemed poised to make this Icebox different. It started with a strong defense side, which saw them clinch nine rounds thanks to a series of great retakes, highlighted by <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7603/mazino">
		Mazino	</a>
</span>&#39;s Harbor.</p>

<p>EDG&#39;s team comp consisted of four agents whose utility could be lethal in the post-plant, but they could not capitalize in those situations. They planted the bomb seven times in the half, winning just one of those rounds.</p>

<p>Even after being blown out in the first half, EDG held their heads high.</p>

<p>A pistol, anti-eco, and bonus round snowballed into them winning the first six rounds of the half. A pair of Leviátan timeouts did not deter them, as they tied up the score after facing what looked to be an insurmountable lead.</p>

<p>After a quiet first half, <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> seemed to have heated up. He&#39;d finish the map with a server-high 28 kills, but in the end, it wouldn&#39;t be enough. Seven of those kills were operator kills. </p>

<p>With the teams knotted at nine rounds apiece, a moment of heroics saved Leviátan from losing a seventh straight round.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8480/aspas">

</span> flicks, ZmjjKK heroics, and chaotic gunfights. Round 19 had everything.</em></p>

<p>After the EDG run, both teams traded punches before heading to overtime. In the run-up to this match, Leviátan had three consecutive overtime Icebox victories against <span data-ref-id="5">

<p>On this particular day, Icebox was defense-sided. Until the third set of overtime rounds, no attack-sided OT rounds were won. In round 30, Leviátan finally found the soft spot of EDG&#39;s defense, clinching a 16-14 victory.</p>

<p>In the end, Leviátan&#39;s nine first-half victories gave them a cushion in a less-than-ideal attacking half, and eventually their fourth straight overtime victory on Icebox.</p>

<p>On Lotus, EDG began on attack and looked to flip the script of map one, dominating on the attack-sided, three-site map. After bolting out to a 5-1 lead, EDG seemed to lose their grip on the map. They&#39;d regain control of it, finishing the half with an 8-4 lead.</p>

<p>The second half was more of the same for EDG. They&#39;d win four straight rounds, with their 12th win being an exciting clutch for their star duelist.</p>


<p><em>KangKang&#39;s 1v3 clutch kills Leviátan&#39;s momentum and brings EDG to map point.</em></p>

<p>While ZmjKK is most well-known for his seemingly impossible operator shots and fearless playstyle, his Neon on Lotus highlighted his movement, sliding around the Leviátan players. He had six first kills on the map, matching the combined output of his opponents.</p>

<p>His supporting cast on Lotus shone through. <span data-ref-id="8">

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1818/tex">

</span>  was the only Leviátan player to finish the map positive, with a team-leading 17 kills.</p>

</span>.</p>

<p>With both sides split at one map each, Abyss would decide who earned their way to a grand final and who faced elimination in the lower bracket. </p>

<p>It was still anybody&#39;s match by halftime, with both sides tied at 6-6. </p>

<p>The question entering 2024 was whether or not EDG could replicate their regional dominance on the international stage. On Abyss, going into the second half, it was whether or not EDG&#39;s zero-sentinel team comp could defend against the Leviátan attack.</p>

<p>On attack, the Americas region&#39;s no. 1 seed laid claim on mid, with aspas&#39;s Outlaw making space for his team to the defenders&#39; side of the map. All the while, the story for EDG was their ability to lock down the A site of Abyss.</p>

<p>Trailing 10-7, EDG called their final timeout. Their opponents still had two to burn, meaning they had their opportunities to stop any momentum EDG might find. </p>

<p>Both teams eventually found themselves tied at 11 rounds each, with the star duelists of either side armed with operators. </p>


<p><em>EDG reach match point against Leviátan, courtesy of three kills from ZmjKK.</em></p>

<p>EDG wrapped up business the following round, only dropping one player and breaking past the barrier to reach the Chinese region&#39;s first-ever international grand final.</p>

<p>Leviátan&#39;s two losses in their Champions 2024 campaign were to Chinese teams. Leviátan head coach <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/333/itopata">
		Itopata	</a>
</span> said that there are similarities between Trace and EDG, but that there are also takeaways from Friday&#39;s loss.</p>

<p>“They&#39;re trading better than us. They are playing more together than us,” he said following the match. “EDG individually is a lot, a lot better. If you give them something, they&#39;re gonna run away with the game. We should know now for the grand final to not do that.”</p>

<p>ZmjKK finished with a server-high 61 kills across all maps, including a server-leading 20 first kills. Teammates <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> and Smoggy finished with 59 and 58, respectively. Leviátan&#39;s Mazino finished with a team-high 57, while star duelist aspas ended with 53.</p>

<p>With the loss, Leviátan will play the winner of <span data-ref-id="13">
