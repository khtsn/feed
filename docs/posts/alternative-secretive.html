The church, Word of Faith Fellowship, has for decades drawn controversy over its cultish insularity and its treatment of children and adults who have been judged by church leaders to be sinners.</p><p>As church leaders have acknowledged in legal proceedings, Word of Faith relies on a practice known as “strong” or “blasting” prayer. Former church members have described the entire congregation surrounding and screaming at a single member for as long as an hour in an effort to expunge the evil from the person. Church officials say this characterization is overstated.</p><p>Beginning with a report by the TV news journal “Inside Edition” in 1995 and culminating in an investigative series by two Associated Press reporters that would become a book in 2020, numerous former church members have come forward and described being physically assaulted during such prayers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Whaley and her husband, Sam, seen here in 1995, founded Word of Faith together.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chuck Burton/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In an interview, Matthew Fenner, a former congregant who told the A.P. reporters that he was 19 when he was blasted and beaten by five church members in 2013 for being gay, said that Word of Faith rationalized its brutal treatment of him and others. “To them, I wasn’t being abused,” Mr. Fenner said. “I was being saved and delivered.”</p><p>Word of Faith has consistently disputed these claims. As one of the members who frequently volunteers at Trump rallies, Hannah Davies, said in a testimonial posted on the church’s website: “I want everyone to know this prayer is not abusive, no one is hit, no one is punched, no one is screamed at. This prayer is full of love and freedom.”</p><p>None of the church’s history comes up at Mr. Trump’s rallies, and the former president has never once mentioned the church the North Carolina women belong to.</p><p>The women serve as a trusted volunteer arm of the campaign’s advance team. They arrive well before the beginning of a Trump event, set up chairs in the V.I.P. section, run the media sign-in table and disassemble the V.I.P. section after the rally is over. Contrary to Mr. Trump’s assertion that the women attend the rallies without their spouses, in recent months their husbands have been seen distributing floor passes and policing the V.I.P. areas, all of them in blue long-sleeved shirts with “Team Trump” on the back and their first initial and last name stenciled on their shirt pockets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-10"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: members of the Word of Faith church at Trump rallies in Asheville, N.C., in 2016; Salem, N.C., in 2016; Fayetteville, N.C., in 2019; the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in 2024; Fletcher, N.C., in 2016; and Philadelphia in 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Damon Winter/The New York Times, Todd Heisler/The New York Times, Doug Mills/The New York Times, Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times, Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The women and their husbands declined to be interviewed for this article. Instead, the church’s attorney, Joshua Farmer, emailed a statement from the members explaining what motivated their volunteer work for the campaign.</p><p>“God has spoken to our hearts that President Trump is the person who will lead this country in the right direction,” the statement said. The church members did not further specify religious reasons for their support of the former president, instead citing his “policies on important issues,” including “economics, immigration, foreign policy and national security.”</p><p>In the statement, Mr. Farmer said that his wife, Andrea Farmer, is among the volunteers. Others represent the upper echelon of the church’s hierarchy, beginning with the co-founders of the church, Jane and Sam Whaley. Robin Webster, their daughter and a longtime teacher in the church’s K-through-12 private school, is also a volunteer, as is the church’s associate minister, Kim Waites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Word of Faith members preparing for an event at Mr. Trump’s Bedminster golf course in New Jersey after he was arraigned on federal charges over his handling of classified documents.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ed Jones/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Word of Faith is in Rutherford County, where the Republican Party chairman, Bryson Smith, a church member, encouraged others to travel to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, writing on social media: “Calling all patriots! Our country needs you! The time is now!”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It is unclear whether any of the church members were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, but Holly Morris, the wife of a church leader, posted on social media a month before the 2020 election that “no true Christian” could vote for the Democratic nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr. A few days before Jan. 6, she wrote, “See you in #WashingtonDC @realDonaldTrump.”</p><p>Republicans say the church constitutes a formidable voting bloc in the 10th Congressional District, which includes all of Rutherford County. During the 2020 Republican primary, the incumbent congressman, Representative Patrick McHenry, carried every precinct in the district except for the church’s home in Spindale — a likely consequence, Republicans said, of Mr. McHenry’s support for church closings during the first months of the Covid pandemic, which Word of Faith initially resisted.</p><p>During the 2022 midterm elections, several Word of Faith members donated a combined $7,850 to the Trump-endorsed incumbent in the neighboring 11th District, Madison Cawthorn. Mr. Cawthorn was defeated in his primary, but church members had worked hard to distribute his campaign literature at numerous precincts, according to the former state representative of the area, Mike Hager.</p><p>“I’ll say that for Word of Faith,” Mr. Hager said in an interview. “They’re very involved and they make themselves heard.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the church with Lt.
