Unlike the smoke over places such as Minnesota and Wisconsin, the dust moving across Florida was higher in the atmosphere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s not reaching the ground,” Mr. Molleda said.</p><p>The dust has also ushered dry air into Florida, bringing a respite from several days of heavy rain.</p><p>“We still have showers and thunderstorms in the forecast, but we’re expecting less rain today because of the dust,” Mr. Molleda said. “Certainly compared to the last few days there’s certainly a lower chance for rain.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7c6bcf79">The dust is lifted off the Sahara by winds.</h2><p>The Saharan Air Layer forms when winds lift sand and minerals from the Sahara in North Africa into the atmosphere. It then gets whisked away by a strong wind current, which sometimes pushes it north into Europe, but more commonly carries it west across the Atlantic Ocean. It usually reaches the Caribbean and the Gulf Coast region several times a year.</p><p>The dust events occur year-round but are most common from about mid-May into August, usually peaking mid-June to July.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/weather/saharan-dust-florida-gulf-coast.html" title="">Earlier forecasts had indicated</a> that a cloud of dust would travel from the Caribbean into the Gulf Coast region, but on Thursday the dust plume began to disperse when it encountered a weather system off the coast of Florida</p><p>“It was looking like we were going to get a big slug of dust along the Gulf Coast, now that has trended more toward Florida, Georgia and South Carolina,” said Paul Miller, an assistant professor of coastal meteorology at Louisiana State University. “There’s going to be a lot over the ocean too, but it may meander back over the Florida Peninsula.”</p><p>Mr. Miller said a plume of dust was expected to push into Alabama, Mississippi Louisiana and southeast Texas, most likely Friday into Saturday.</p><p>Houston is expected to see impacts by Friday afternoon and evening and continuing into the weekend. “Still expecting the main impacts to be hazy skies during the day and a decrease in air quality,” said Jimmy Fowler, a meteorologist with the Weather Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A group of people are silhouetted against a hazy hillside as they walk toward the left of the frame." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/04wea-dust-wmbl/04wea-dust-wmbl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9740acde-194f-5b93-b777-6b5aa5268c47" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The dust caused hazy skies in San Juan, P.R., earlier this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ricardo Arduengo/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-469810a9">Over Puerto Rico, the dust looked like a ‘huge fog.’</h2><p>On its journey east, the curtain of dust shrouded skies over Puerto Rico Saturday night into Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Skies were hazy, and visibility at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport dropped to five miles.
