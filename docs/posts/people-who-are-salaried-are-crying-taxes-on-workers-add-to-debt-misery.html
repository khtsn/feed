A tax on business profits doubled to 3 percent. Government fees for money transfers and for phone and internet data services went up 15 to 20 percent. A tax on every import, including essentials like wheat and cooking oil, to be used for railroad development was increased to 2 percent from 1.5 percent. Some exemptions for retirees were scrapped. The list goes on.</p><p>Tax increases are never popular. But the impact on countries like Kenya, with low incomes and crippling debt, is particularly acute. Years of harum-scarum borrowing and spending combined with economic wallops from the Covid-19 pandemic, soaring interest rates and inflation helped drive up Kenya’s debt to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/business/kenya-tax-protests-debt.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">$80 billion</a>.</p><p>Kenya has to use nearly 60 percent of its revenue for paying off its loans.

She got half a dozen callbacks and no job offers.</p><p>Where is the affordable housing? Where are health services and public transportation? Ms. Ndung’u asked. Ms. Gicheru added, “Suddenly the system is crumbling.”</p><p>Ms. Ndung’u said she would rather see Kenyans directly pay off the debt to <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/12/response-debt-distress-africa-and-role-china/02-case-studies-chinese-lending-africa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China,</a> the country’s biggest bilateral creditor, by using M-Changa, a digital fund-raising platform, instead of giving the money to the government through taxes and trusting it to do it.</p><p>As taxes rise, Kenyans have grown angrier about the lack of public services.

They navigate around piles of garbage and occasional raw sewage as well as motorbikes and bicycles hauling oversize loads better suited to a sport utility vehicle. There are no government-funded sanitation services in Kibera.</p><p>The jampacked skyline features ramshackle homes of plasterboard, rusted roofs, and a forest of haphazard poles and wires on which illegal electricity hookups hang like Christmas ornaments.</p><p>Benedict Musyoka, a youth community organizer in Kibera, said a young man had told him: “I won’t marry.” Earning enough to support himself is hard enough, let alone with a wife and child.
