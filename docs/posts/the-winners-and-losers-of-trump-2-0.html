Indeed, the strength of Trump’s victory — he made inroads into most major voter demographics, and helped Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/republicans-senate-control.html" title="">retake the Senate</a> — has drastic implications for the American economy and the corporate world at home and abroad.</p><p>Stocks and other asset classes, including crypto, are surging on the hopes of a more business-friendly Washington. (More on that below.) But the return of Trump also heralds a new class of business winners, along with potentially transformative changes in fiscal policy, federal regulation and more.</p><p>Here’s what could come next.</p><p><strong>Businesses will probably face fewer burdens.</strong> Driving much of the jump in a wide array of stocks and cryptocurrencies is the belief that a second Trump administration will ease regulation, especially for energy companies, financial firms, digital currencies and more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Expect Trump, aided by Republican control of the Senate and possibly the House, to extend the 2017 tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy that are set to expire next year. Whether Trump will go forward with more expansive initiatives, such as eliminating taxes on tips and overtime — or even cutting income taxes generally — remains to be seen.</p><p>But there are wild cards as well:</p><ul><li><p><strong>How will Trump deal with antitrust? </strong>Many corporate leaders have hoped that a Republican White House would undo the Biden administration’s effort to jack up competition policy. But JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has praised Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., for her efforts to crack down on the tech giants that conservatives have criticized for years. While Khan probably wouldn’t continue on in the second Trump administration, her tough-on-tech stance might endure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will Trump give </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/business/dealbook/rfk-trump-health-food-policy.html" title="">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a></strong><strong> real political power?</strong> The president-elect has said Kennedy, a key backer who has divisive views on health and food policies, could “go wild” on health. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/trump-rfk-health-fluoride-vaccines-aca.html" title="">has already suggested</a> that he’d be OK with moves including removing fluoride from drinking water. Agricultural groups have reportedly pressed the Trump camp on any potential changes to policies on pesticides and other farming practices.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Companies are already treading carefully.</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/dealbook/ceos-trump-win.html" title="">Trump has boasted</a> of hearing more from prominent C.E.O.s such as Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, Tim Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta. Trump associates have interpreted that as corporate leaders trying to make nice with him, lest they end up being the target of his ire, like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Deere</a>.</p><p>While former corporate leaders <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/29/ceos-america-largest-companies-voting-for-harris-not-trump-leadership-elections-politics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly opposed Trump’s re-election effort</a>, current C.E.O.s, including normally outspoken ones like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/dealbook/dimon-gates-harris-supporters.html" title="">have stayed quiet</a> for fear of blowback against their companies.</p><p><strong>The future of the Fed’s political independence is unclear.</strong> Trump has said repeatedly that the president should have a greater say in the central bank’s rate-setting policy, a stance that hardened after he repeatedly criticized Jay Powell, the Fed chair. It’s uncertain if Trump has the legal authority to change the Fed’s independence or fire Powell, but with his return to power, he may try to make it happen.</p><p>A key Trump economic adviser, the financier Scott Bessent, has already proposed a way to undercut Powell’s authority by <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-fed-chair-powell-fire-4b79079f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">effectively appointing a shadow chair</a>. (Skeptics have warned that such a move could introduce chaos into the markets.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Will more trade wars erupt?</strong> Trump has embraced the idea of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trumps-tariffs-global-trade.html" title="">expansive levies</a> — “tariff,” he proclaimed recently, “is the most beautiful word in the dictionary” — as a way to promote domestic industry and punish allies and rivals alike. China and Europe are already bracing for the potential fall out.</p><p>Will he follow through? “Markets appear to assume that the campaign rhetoric (specifically around deportations and tariffs) will not fully translate into policy,” Paul Donovan, the chief economist of UBS global wealth management, wrote in a recent note.</p><p><strong>Concerns about the nation’s fiscal health may continue.</strong> Analysts have said that Trump’s policies could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/trump-economic-plans-debt-costs.html" title="">significantly add to the federal debt</a>.
