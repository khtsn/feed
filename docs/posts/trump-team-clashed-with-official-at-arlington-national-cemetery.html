Trump’s campaign team and an official at Arlington National Cemetery confronted each other during the former president’s visit to the cemetery on Monday, the military cemetery said in a statement on Tuesday.</p><p>The altercation was prompted, according to Trump campaign officials, by the presence of a photographer in a section of the cemetery where American troops who were killed in recent wars are buried. The cemetery released a statement saying that federal law prohibits political campaigning or “election-related” activities within Army cemeteries, including by photographers.</p><p>An official with the cemetery tried to “physically block” members of Mr. Trump’s team, Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a statement. Mr. Cheung added that the cemetery official was “clearly suffering from a mental health episode” and that the campaign was prepared to release footage of the confrontation to support its account of the clash. The campaign did not provide that footage after several requests.</p><p>Chris LaCivita, a top Trump campaign adviser, added in a separate statement that the cemetery official was “a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Cemetery officials did not provide their own account of the encounter, saying instead that “there was an incident, and a report was filed.”</p><p>The cemetery added that it had “reinforced and widely shared” to the Trump campaign the federal laws prohibiting campaign activities by photographers “or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign.”</p><p>News of the altercation was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported</a> by NPR.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/us/politics/votevets-biden-democrats-ads.html" title="">VoteVets, the liberal veterans group,</a> called on Mr. Trump to fire the members of his team involved in the confrontation.</p><p>Mr. Trump had visited the cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony honoring 13 American troops who were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/us/politics/marines-kabul-airport-attack.html" title="">killed in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate</a> at the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, during the United States’ withdrawal from that country three years ago. Mr. Trump has blamed President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the bombing and America’s chaotic withdrawal, and repeated his attacks on the subject <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/us/politics/trump-harris-afghanistan-withdrawal.html" title="">in campaign events after his visit to the cemetery.</a></p><p>Mr. Trump had laid three wreaths at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/us/tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier-100th-anniversary.html" title="">Tomb of the Unknowns</a> in Arlington National Cemetery on Monday morning, the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing. Two of the wreaths were for Marines killed: Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover and Sgt. Nicole Gee. A third was dedicated to all 13 troops killed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump was accompanied for the laying of the wreaths by family members of the slain troops, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/us/politics/afghanistan-withdrawal-house-hearing.html" title="">Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews</a> and <a href="https://www.fox19.com/2021/11/25/surviving-afghanistan-tri-state-marine-paralyzed-kabul-airport-attacks-continues-road-recovery/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Corporal Kelsee Lainhart</a>, two Marines who were injured in the Abbey Gate attack. Sergeant Vargas-Andrews lost his right arm and left leg in the attack, and Corporal Lainhart was paralyzed in the attack and now uses a wheelchair.</p><p>Mr. Trump then accompanied the families and Marine veterans to Section 60 of the cemetery, reserved for those recently killed in America’s wars abroad, including at Abbey Gate.</p><p>That part of Mr. Trump’s visit was private and closed to the press. Mr. Cheung, the Trump campaign spokesman, <a href="https://x.com/TheStevenCheung/status/1828575389783933439" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pointed to a screenshot of an email</a> that he argued gave the campaign photo access to Section 60. That excerpt, however, says that “former President Trump may have an official photographer and/or videographer outside of the main media pool,” but it does not suggest Mr. Trump’s photographer was given special access.</p><p>The campaign also shared text messages from family members of the veterans consenting to having Mr. Trump’s campaign media attend the event at Section 60. The campaign did not provide evidence that the cemetery gave them permission to have a photographer at Section 60 — which the cemetery said in its statement would be a violation of federal law.</p><p>Gov. Spencer J. Cox, Republican of Utah — who visited the cemetery with Mr. Trump — shared a photo from Section 60 on social media, with Mr. Trump and others in a “thumbs-up” pose around the grave of Staff Sergeant Hoover.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Cameron covers politics for The Times, focusing on breaking news and the 2024 campaign.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron">More about Chris Cameron</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jonathan Swan is a political reporter covering the 2024 presidential election and Donald Trump’s campaign.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-swan">More about Jonathan Swan</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
