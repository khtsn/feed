In a social media post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that China violated a trade pact with the United States and suggested he could return to a more confrontational approach.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><time datetime="2025-05-30T15:49:45-04:00"><span>May 30, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>3:49 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump and his advisers on Friday leveled sharp attacks against China over trade, reviving an economic dispute that led to steep tariffs and a confrontation over critical next-generation technologies.</p><p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114596705340367716" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a post on Truth Social</a>, Mr. Trump accused Beijing of violating the terms of a fragile truce struck earlier this month between the two countries that included rolling back tariffs and other trade barriers. The agreement was intended to give both sides time to reach a larger deal that would avert an all-out trade war.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s accusations alluded to China’s promise to reduce export restrictions around rare earth minerals that are key components in many technology and military products. The president suggested that China had continued to limit access to those goods, as he appeared to adopt a more confrontational posture on trade.</p><p>“So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” he proclaimed.</p><p>Speaking to reporters later in the day, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, stressed that the president prefers cooperation. But, he warned, China’s behavior “opens up all manner of action for the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The standoff between the two nations has created significant concern for businesses and investors, and has raised fears of a global economic downturn in recent months. Stocks were down slightly on Friday.</p><p>The new dispute arrives at a moment of great uncertainty for Mr. Trump’s ability to brandish steep tariffs to force other countries to make trade concessions. A federal trade court earlier this week declared many of the president’s duties to be illegal, including some that he imposed on China on emergency grounds. An appeals court later restored that power temporarily until a panel of judges can hear the government’s arguments fighting the original ruling.</p><p>“Hopefully now we’ll go to court and just win that battle, because if we don’t have the power to do what they’re doing to us, we are going to be a great nation no longer,” Mr. Trump said at a media event at the Oval Office on Friday.</p><p>The United States had ratcheted tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent earlier this year, and China had hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. Beijing also moved to set up a licensing system for exports of rare earths, which are needed by U.S. manufacturers of cars, semiconductors and airplanes, including the defense industry. Those restrictions threatened to cripple vital American industries, which lobbied the Trump administration for relief.</p><p>In early May, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, met in Switzerland with their Chinese counterparts in a bid to defuse the tensions. Both sides agreed to walk back the measures they had taken, including by lowering high tariffs for 90 days, and to hold additional talks on a more comprehensive agreement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>U.S. officials had also expected China to relax restrictions it had imposed on critical minerals, but they do not appear to be pleased with Beijing’s efforts.</p><p>In recent days, the Chinese have restarted some shipments of rare earth materials, but they have been limited, a person familiar with the sales said. American companies remain concerned about their access to critical Chinese supplies.</p><p>“I’m sure that I’ll speak to President Xi and hopefully we’ll work that out,” Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office.</p><p>The United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/economy/jet-engine-chip-software-exports-to-china.html" title="">has recently begun reviewing</a> its own exports of critical products to China. It has paused issuing licenses that allow American companies to sell a range of products and technologies to China, including software used to design semiconductors, aviation technology and other goods like machinery, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The administration has also focused on trying to develop domestic supplies of rare earths, including considering financing new mines and processing facilities, one person familiar with the effort said. But such efforts could take years to become reality.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>China dominates the processing and production of many critical minerals, and it appears to be continuing to build out a government system that would monitor and dole out global minerals to companies worldwide. Earlier this week, the Chinese government met with domestic and European chip companies to brief them on how to request licenses for rare earths, according to Chinese state media.</p><p>In a statement earlier this week, the Chinese commerce ministry said that the security and stability of the global chip supply chain was “facing severe challenges” and that it “resolutely” rejected “unilateralism and bullying.”</p><p>Amid the standoff, diplomatic ties between the United States and China have become even more strained in recent days. Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/china-student-visas-revoke.html" title="">announced on Wednesday</a> that the Trump administration would work to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or who are studying in “critical fields.”</p><p>During an appearance on CNBC on Friday, Mr. Greer said that U.S. officials “haven’t seen the flow of some of those critical minerals like they’re supposed to be doing.”</p><p>“We’re very concerned with it,” he said, adding: “The Chinese are slow rolling their compliance, which is completely unacceptable and has to be addressed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Greer also rejected the assertion that the administration’s legal defeat this week had harmed U.S. negotiations, though he had told the court only days earlier that such an adverse ruling would harm diplomatic efforts.</p><p>“All the other countries I’m dealing with in negotiations are just treating this as just kind of a bump in the road, rather than any fundamental change,” Mr. Greer said. “So I feel pretty confident about the case, and if the case goes the other way, we have other tools as well.”</p><p>The impact of Mr. Trump’s tariffs have become apparent in trade-related data, which on Friday showed that imports of goods dropped nearly 20 percent in April. That is the largest monthly decline on record. The goods trade deficit nearly halved, to around $88 billion.</p><p>In his post on Friday, Mr. Trump vented that China was not living up to its end of the bargain.</p><p>“I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen.”</p><p>He added: “The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.
