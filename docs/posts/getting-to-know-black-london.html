As a child, I accompanied my mother to buy ingredients for Nigerian dishes in Upton Park, an area of East London known for its South Asian community. And on neighborhood streets, Black hairdressers and barbershops are interspersed among halal butchers, traditional English cafes (called caffs) and Eastern European restaurants.</p><p>In a city so diffuse with diversity, where, then, is “Black London”? The community is particularly visible in places like Brixton and Peckham in South London, Hackney in the east and Notting Hill in the west. The rich culture of these African and Caribbean communities can be experienced in restaurants, bars and cultural institutions. Below are a few of those places.</p><h2 id="link-186e64b7">Tasting Black London</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chuku’s, in the north London neighborhood of Tottenham, is a Nigerian restaurant that offers shared plates (some based on chin chin, a Nigerian fried-dough snack) ranging from about 5 to 14 pounds (about $6 to $18).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>On a street in the north London neighborhood of Tottenham, the greeting “Welcome to Lagos” is printed on the door of <a href="https://www.chukuslondon.co.uk/nigerian-tapas-restaurant-bookings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chuku’s</a>. Within its salmon-colored walls, staples of Nigerian cuisine take on a new life in sharing plates priced between 5 and 14 pounds (about $6 to $18). For instance, <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/chin-chin" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chin chin</a>, a dangerously addictive fried dough snack, serves as the foundation for cheesecake, and suya (grilled and well-seasoned <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/west-african-grilled-beef-suya-recipe-7497838" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pieces of beef or chicken</a>) is reimagined here as sauce-laden meatballs.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Two siblings of Nigerian and Grenadian heritage founded Chuku’s as a way to introduce the uninitiated to Nigerian dining, and as a way for members of the diaspora to connect with their culture. “We’re Nigerians, we’re loud, we’re verbose,” said Ifeyinwa Frederick, one of the owners. “We wanted a buzzy atmosphere that represented that kind of vibrant, boisterous nature.”</p><p>This year, recognition of London’s West African cuisine came in the form of Michelin stars for two restaurants near Oxford Street: <a href="https://www.chishuru.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chishuru</a> and <a href="https://akoko.co.uk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Akoko</a>. While less populist than Chuku’s, these restaurants also meld African flavors with Western traditions. On Akoko’s £120 tasting menu, plantain puffs have been served with beef tartare, and Gambian stew with Irish oysters. And at Chishuru, whose prix fixe dinner menu is priced at £95, egusi — a seed used in soup, usually served with pounded yam — flavors an ice cream accompanying a meringue sponge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We’re Nigerians, we’re loud, we’re verbose,” said Ifeyinwa Frederick, one of Chuku’s owners. “We wanted a buzzy atmosphere that represented that kind of vibrant, boisterous nature.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-7c726845">‘We’re feeling strong’</h2><p>The rise of these restaurants reflects a decades-long evolution of the makeup of Black London. Caribbeans were long the dominant Black community, and thus Black culture, in London. In the 1980s and 1990s, migrants from West Africa — my parents among them — began to arrive in Britain for work and study in larger numbers, with many settling in areas like Peckham in South London, known as Little Lagos for its Nigerian community. These communities, now more established, are <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/10/02/how-british-nigerians-quietly-made-their-way-to-the-top" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">influencing the culture around them</a>. “In the food and in the music and in what’s culturally meaningful and exciting, there’s much more of a shared and a real sort of emergent African emphasis,” Jimi Famurewa, the author of “Settlers: Journeys Through the Food, Faith and Culture of Black African London,” said.</p><p>Emeka Frederick, the other co-owner of Chuku’s, sees the current moment as a kind of maturation. “When we were growing up, that community was just settling and putting down roots,” he said. “We roll it 30 years forward and it’s like that community is not only settled, it’s now — we’re feeling strong.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/18visualUploader-72992-cover/18visualUploader-72992-cover-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/18visualUploader-72992-cover/18visualUploader-72992-cover-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/11/18/129765_1_18visualUploader-72992_wg_360p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In the Peckham neighborhood, Jumbi is a bar and restaurant where the music and food reflects the owners’ Caribbean background.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Black London loves to party. Indeed, one of the biggest celebrations in the city comes from the Caribbean community: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/world/europe/notting-hill-carnival-claudia-jones.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Notting Hill Carnival</a>, an annual event in West London, attended by hundreds of thousands every August.</p><p>For year-round revelry, however, visitors could navigate the streets of Peckham to <a href="https://www.jumbipeckham.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jumbi</a>, a hi-fi music bar that emanates cool. The spot, which opened in 2022, is an ode to the owners’ Caribbean heritage and is named for a figure in Caribbean folklore. These roots are reflected in the music and food. Park yourself at a table, enjoy oxtail in Trinidadian flatbread (£14), sip on Caribbean-inspired cocktails, and later head to the dance floor. In the same neighborhood, <a href="https://princeofpeckham.co.uk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Prince of Peckham</a> pub is an excellent candidate for late-night dancing to hip-hop and R&amp;B, and Caribbean food.</p><p>For live music, <a href="https://troybar.co.uk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Troy Bar</a> is an unassuming place on an even more unassuming road off East London’s Old Street, an area filled with bars and restaurants. Troy Bar’s vibe is comfortable, almost living room-like — as is its food: home-style, affordable Caribbean staples like curry goat, jerk chicken and grilled fish, for £7 a plate. It also offers an open-mic night on Tuesdays, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBOC4F1Ix5E/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reggae on Thursdays</a> and jazz on Fridays.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The dance floor is another element that draws people to Jumbi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>For the club-inclined, young Black nightlife has been somewhat defined in recent years by the rise of the party companies <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rec.ess/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Recess</a> and <a href="https://www.dltbrunch.co.uk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DLT</a>, both run by groups of Black British men.
