Both easily lapped their Republican primary opponents in fund-raising and trumpeted Mr. Trump’s endorsement, which deterred bigger names from entering the races.</p><p>In Florida’s Sixth Congressional District, Randy Fine, a state senator, beat two others in the race to replace Mr. Waltz, who left the House of Representatives to serve as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. Mr. Fine will face Josh Weil, a Democrat and a public-school teacher.</p><p>Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s chief financial officer, outpolled nine other candidates in the G.O.P. race to fill Mr. Gaetz’s seat, in the state’s First Congressional District. He will face Gay Valimont, a gun violence activist who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If Mr. Fine and Mr. Patronis win their general-election contests, they will bolster Republicans’ slim majority in the House; Republicans currently have 218 seats, compared with 215 for Democrats. That edge could shrink even further if Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, is confirmed as Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>Mr. Gaetz, who was Mr. Trump’s initial pick for attorney general, resigned from Congress on Nov. 13, effectively ending a House investigation into allegations that he had engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.</p><p>Facing an uphill confirmation battle, however, Mr. Gaetz abruptly withdrew his name from consideration on Nov. 21, saying it “was unfairly becoming a distraction” to the Trump administration’s transition.</p><p>In December, the House Ethics Committee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/us/politics/gaetz-house-ethics-report.html" title="">released its investigation</a> into Mr. Gaetz, saying it had found that he had used illegal drugs, regularly paid women for sex and had sex with an underage girl. Mr. Gaetz denied any wrongdoing.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Congress</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Capitol Hill.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Penalizing Abortion Providers: </strong>The House passed a measure <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/house-abortion-bill.html">that would threaten medical providers with up to five years in prison</a> for failing to resuscitate babies born alive during abortions.
