The U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, in the Gulf of Oman, is on an extended deployment in the region, and a second aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, left Norfolk, Va., a week ago for the Mediterranean as part of a regularly scheduled deployment.</p><p>Last week, the Pentagon announced it was deploying additional troops to the region but declined to give a number.</p><p>Israeli commando units have made brief incursions into Lebanon in recent days to prepare for a possible wider ground invasion, according to several Israeli officers and officials and a senior Western official. But American officials said on Monday that they believed that the invasion would be limited.</p><p>The Israeli and Western officials said the raids were focused on gathering intelligence about Hezbollah’s positions near the border, as well as identifying the Iranian-backed group’s tunnels and military infrastructure, in order to attack them from the air or the ground. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military matter. The Israeli military declined to comment.</p><p>Hezbollah began attacking northern Israel soon after Hamas, which is also backed by Iran, attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since then.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Sunday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III warned that “should Iran, its partners or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every necessary measure to defend our people,” according to a Pentagon statement.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Helene Cooper is a Pentagon correspondent.
