Kathy Hochul of New York wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: “Outrageous. I’m going to make sure New Yorkers are protected.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for the insurer said on Thursday that the letters — to commercial providers on Nov. 1 and to Medicaid providers on Dec. 1 — misstated the planned policy change.</p><p>“We are not moving forward with the policy change because of the misinformation,” Janey Kiryluik, staff vice president for corporate communications with Elevance Health, Anthem’s parent company, said.</p><p>“We realized, based on all the feedback we’ve been receiving the last 24 hours, that our communication about the policy was unclear, which is why we’re pulling back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Generally speaking, any medically necessary anesthesia, we will and always have and will pay for, even with this change,” Ms. Kiryluik added.</p><p>Even now, though, if an anesthesiologist bills for eight hours of services for a procedure that typically lasts four hours, she said, documentation would be required to support the charges: “We won’t automatically approve that.”</p><p>The company’s earlier letters to providers stated otherwise, saying that new time limits would be enforced.</p><p>The advice said that Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield for New York, Connecticut and Missouri were changing how they evaluate claims for anesthesia services starting on Feb. 1, 2025.</p><p>The standard payment formula is based on medical codes indicating the type of care provided, as well as a time element, anesthesiologists said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Those in private plans who reported times exceeding the average for a procedure would not be paid at all, Anthem said.</p><p>“Claims submitted with reported time above the established number of minutes will be denied,” the company’s letter said.</p><p>In a separate missive regarding Medicaid plans, Anthem said that claims for anesthesia services exceeding the set limits would be reimbursed only up to the limit, or preset average time for the procedure.</p><p>Anthem noted that the new limits would not be applied to maternity care or to pediatric patients 21 or younger.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Roni Caryn Rabin is a Times health reporter focused on maternal and child health, racial and economic disparities in health care, and the influence of money on medicine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin">More about Roni Caryn Rabin</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Discover More in Health and Science</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Hysterectomy Variations: </strong>Patients often are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/health/hysterectomy-ovaries-women.html">in the dark about which organs remain</a> and which were removed during the procedure, which can profoundly influence lifelong health.</p></li><li><p><strong>On the Wings of War</strong>: Scientists study the flight of hummingbirds to design <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/science/hummingbirds-robots-drone-warfare.html">robots for drone warfare</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Stray Dog on an Egyptian Pyramid</strong>: A video of a dog on a pyramid took off on social media — but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/science/dog-pyramid-viral-video.html">only after it was appropriated and doctored</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>More Nazca Lines Emerge</strong>: With drones and A.I., researchers were able to identify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/science/nazca-lines-peru-ai.html">303 previously uncharted geoglyphs</a> made by a pre-Inca civilization in present-day Peru.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finding a Rare ‘Doomsday Fish’</strong>: In Japanese mythology, the deep-sea-dwelling oarfish is a harbinger of impending disaster.
