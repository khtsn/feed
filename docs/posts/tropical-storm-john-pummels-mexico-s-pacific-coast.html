It then weakened to a tropical storm again. Tropical storm warnings from the Mexican authorities were in effect on Tuesday from Punta Maldonado westward to Zihuatanejo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Residents should get ready for heavy rains.</strong> Forecasters are also predicting six to 12 inches of rain through Thursday, and up to 30 inches in isolated areas along the coastline. Heavy rains could cause catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides in Oaxaca, along with the Mexican states of Chiapas and Guerrero. Other regions could see as much as 12 inches of rain through Thursday that could cause life-threatening flood risks, especially near the coast.</p></li></ul><p>By Tuesday morning, the storm had dumped more than 10 inches of rain on parts of Guerrero and Oaxaca, two of the country’s poorest states, the authorities said at a news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The storm’s most severe effects were felt in Guerrero, said Evelyn Salgado, the state’s governor. At least two people were killed in their home by a landslide in the municipality of Tlacoachistlahuaca. More than 85 percent of residents there live in poverty, government data shows.</p><p>The authorities also documented blocked roads, downed poles, toppled trees and blown-off roofs in several communities.</p><p>Laura Velázquez Alzúa, Mexico’s civil protection coordinator, said more than 98,000 users had lost power across the region, but electricians had already restored service for about 35 percent of them. Two airports in Oaxaca remained closed, she added. And about 18,000 members of the armed forces, as well as government workers, had been deployed to help the affected communities.</p><p>On Monday, John’s constant rains had already generated some landslides, slowing traffic on a recently inaugurated highway. Civil protection authorities had started coordinating the opening of shelters in about 50 municipalities across Oaxaca.</p><p>A recent study showed that rapid intensification like what John has undergone is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/climate/hurricane-intensity-stronger-faster.html" title="">twice as likely</a>, at least for Atlantic hurricanes, partially because of human-caused climate change driven by the burning of fossil fuels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Earlier this year, Hurricane Beryl <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/weather/hurricane-beryl-size.html" title="">broke records</a> when it became the earliest hurricane ever to reach Category 4 and then Category 5 intensity in the Atlantic Basin, with wind speeds increasing by 35 miles per hour or more within a 24-hour period.</p><p>John is likely to bring damaging hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge, or an unusually high rise in sea level and wave height that could cause flooding.</p><p>Hurricanes are also unleashing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/29/climate/climate-change-hurricanes.html#:~:text=In%20a%202018%20paper%2C%20Dr,wetter%20storms%20also%20worsen%20flooding." title="">higher levels of rainfall</a> as global temperatures increase.</p><p>Carrie Stevenson, a faculty member at the University of Florida who works with local communities on hurricane preparedness, said the rainfall forecast could be devastating.</p><p>“It’s going to be a really big rainmaker,” Ms. Stevenson said. “Flash flooding could be the most dangerous part of this.”</p><p>She’s also concerned that if the storm is strong enough it could cross Mexico and emerge in the Gulf of Mexico, near where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/weather/gulf-of-mexico-helene.html" title="">Tropical Storm Helene</a> is expected to move north this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I’d definitely watch that because it’s not on the radar of anyone in the Gulf of Mexico,” Ms. Stevenson said.</p><p>Ali Watkins<!-- --> and <!-- -->John Yoon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emiliano-rodriguez-mega">More about Emiliano Rodríguez Mega</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
