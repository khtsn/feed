Referring to the type of showy elements typically used in opening ceremonies, he added, “Glitz and pyro and special effects and flying people, all that stuff is important, but you want to get people here” — he gestured to his heart — “in some kind of way.”</p><p>In Atlanta — which was selected to host the Games over several other cities, including Athens, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896 — Mr. Mischer insisted that Greek imagery be part of the opening ceremony, said David Neal, NBC Sports’s coordinating producer for the Olympics. “He had backlit silhouettes of athletes posing like a living Greek vase.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Mischer was the executive producer of NBC’s broadcast of the opening ceremony at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City; the Primetime Emmy Awards, numerous times between 1993 and 2019; and the Tony Awards, from 1987 to 1989.

The broadcast coverage of President John F.
