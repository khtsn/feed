She encouraged New Yorkers not to rush to judgment after the first investigation — into the mayor’s campaign fund-raising — came to light.</p><p>“It has been a great honor to serve the city,” she wrote in a brief letter to the mayor on Saturday. “I am tendering my resignation, effective today, as I have concluded that I can no longer effectively serve in my position. I wish you nothing but the best.”</p><p>Ms. Zornberg’s resignation was stunning, not only because of her position and the highly sensitive moment at which it came, but because of its suddenness and because it was effective immediately, allowing no time for a transition to a new counsel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Her departure came two days after the police commissioner, Edward A. Caban, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">resigned at the request of City Hall</a> after federal agents took his phone in one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-sheena-fbi-search-nyc.html" title="">four criminal investigations</a> that involve members of the administration and the mayor himself. The U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, where Ms. Zornberg worked, is conducting three of the inquiries, two of which on Sept. 4 led to the seizure of phones from several top officials. The U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn is conducting the fourth.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index-articleLarge-v2.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Tracking Investigations In Eric Adams’s Orbit</h2><p>Several federal corruption inquiries have reached into the world of Mayor Eric Adams of New York, who faces re-election next year. Here is a closer look at how people with ties to Adams are related to the inquiries.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The investigations into Mr. Adams and his inner circle have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/nyregion/eric-adams-scandal-crisis.html" title="">destabilized his administration</a> and prompted two state lawmakers to call on the mayor to resign. The mayor, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, has said that the investigations will show he committed no misconduct and that he remains focused on serving New Yorkers.</p><p>Mr. Adams said in a statement on Saturday: “We appreciate all the work Lisa has done for our administration and, more importantly, the city over the past 13 months. These are hard jobs and we don’t expect anyone to stay in them forever. We wish Lisa all the best in her future endeavors.”</p><p>When Mr. Adams was asked on Sunday about why Ms. Zornberg left, he said that he would not discuss his private conversation with her about the matter. The mayor told reporters at the African American Day Parade in Manhattan that Ms. Zornberg wanted to move on to the “next level of her professional life” and that New Yorkers were telling him: “New York is a tough place — hang in there, you fight for New York.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Zornberg declined to comment.One person with knowledge of the matter said that Ms. Zornberg had resigned largely because the mayor was not following her advice on certain personnel matters.</p><p>Another person with knowledge of the matter, referring to the Southern District of New York’s criminal inquiry focused on the mayor, stressed that her departure “is not because of the S.D.N.Y. investigation relating to the mayor, and is not because of any new information obtained regarding the mayor.”</p><p>Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the mayor, when asked whether Ms. Zornberg had left because the mayor was not taking her advice, declined to answer, instead referring a reporter back to Ms. Zornberg’s three-sentence letter and the mayor’s comments. “Also, I would point out that she was the City Hall lawyer, and she was privy to conversations I’m not part of, so I can’t speak to that,” he added.</p><p>The city’s chief counsel advises the mayor on key policy and legal issues and oversees nearly a dozen agencies, including the offices for labor relations and procurement.</p><p>Ms. Zornberg, who was hired in part for her reputation for integrity, joined City Hall in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/nyregion/eric-adams-lisa-zornberg-chief-counsel.html" title="">July 2023</a> after serving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/business/manhattan-us-attorney-expected-to-name-defense-lawyer-to-lead-criminal-unit.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">from 2016 to 2018</a> as chief of the Southern District’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/business/manhattan-us-attorney-expected-to-name-defense-lawyer-to-lead-criminal-unit.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">criminal division</a>, where she supervised investigations and prosecutions by roughly 170 prosecutors. She succeeded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/17/nyregion/adams-brendan-mcguire-lawyer.html" title="">Brendan R. McGuire</a>, who had been chief counsel since Mr. Adams took office in January 2022 and is representing the mayor in an investigation into his campaign fund-raising.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Zornberg was one of a handful of top officials who sat next to Mr. Adams at his weekly news conferences at City Hall, fielding questions about the federal investigations and drawing on her expertise as a prosecutor to defend the mayor.</p><p>Mr. Adams will have to find a replacement for her at a time when he is already struggling to hire a new corporation counsel — another top city official who leads the Law Department and represents the city, its agencies and the mayor in civil litigation.</p><p>The mayor’s choice for corporation counsel, Randy Mastro, a former aide to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/nyregion/randy-mastro-eric-adams-lawyer-withdraws.html" title="">withdrew his nomination last week</a> to avoid a public rebuke from the City Council, where many members opposed his nomination.</p><p>Mr. Adams said in the statement on Saturday that senior members of Ms. Zornberg’s team would “remain in their roles to ensure the office continues to fully operate without issue” and that he expected to name an acting chief counsel “in the coming days.”</p><p>The mayor’s press office released a statement from Ms. Zornberg saying that she was “deeply grateful to Mayor Adams for giving me the opportunity to serve the city, and I strongly support the work he has done and continues to do for New Yorkers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When Mr. Adams was asked at a news conference last week about the various investigations, Ms. Zornberg interjected to say that city officials could not discuss details.</p><p>“Those are all aspects of pending investigations that it would be improper for us to share, because we are in a posture of not wanting to impede any investigation,” she said.</p><p>Dana Rubinstein<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma G.
