We are building a bigger and better Republican Party together, a party of people who believe in greater freedom and a vital economy to create more opportunities.”</p><p>Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by more than 900,000 voters, and the state has not elected a Republican senator in 52 years. Mr. Kim raised three times as much in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidates/?q=S4NJ00466&amp;q=bashaw&amp;q=kim+senate&amp;is_active_candidate=true&amp;has_raised_funds=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign contributions</a>, and Mr. Bashaw, a hotel developer from South Jersey who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/nyregion/nj-senate-menendez-republican-bashaw.html" title="">ran as a political outsider</a>, consistently trailed in <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/fdu-poll-finds-kim-up-big-in-new-jersey-senate-race/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polls</a>, leaving few people in doubt of Tuesday’s result.</p><p>Still, the start of Mr. Kim’s campaign was replete with perhaps enough political intrigue for an entire election cycle.</p><p>He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/nyregion/andy-kim-new-jersey-senate.html" title="">jumped into the contest</a> the day after Mr. Menendez, 70, was accused by federal prosecutors in Manhattan of being at the center of a yearslong international bribery scheme. Two months later, Ms. Murphy also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/nyregion/tammy-murphy-senate-bob-menendez.html" title="">entered the race</a> for the Democratic nomination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Murphy, a fund-raising powerhouse, was a first-time candidate with limited experience. Her candidacy was almost entirely dependent on the support of county political leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/nyregion/menendez-tammy-murphy-senate-new-jersey.html" title="">beholden to the Democratic governor</a>, Philip D. Murphy. That combination of factors led critics — and Mr. Kim — to denounce her campaign as an example of the same political self-dealing that had allowed Mr. Menendez to thrive.</p><p>She dropped out before the primary election.</p><p>Before she quit, however, Mr. Kim, a third-term House member from South Jersey, filed a federal lawsuit that sought to dismantle the state’s decades-old primary ballot design that gave county political leaders outsize power.</p><p>Candidates favored by local political bosses have for years been awarded prominent ballot positions in a row or column known as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/us/politics/murphy-menendez-senate.html" title="">the line</a>.” The names of unendorsed candidates appeared off to the side, in so-called ballot Siberia, and generally lost.</p><p>Mr. Kim won the legal challenge, and in late March a federal judge ordered clerks to redesign the ballots, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/nyregion/new-jersey-political-scandals.html" title="">upending politics</a> in a state often seen as synonymous with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/nyregion/anthony-salters-new-jersey-prison.html" title="">political corruption</a>. </p><p>Mr. Menendez faces a lengthy prison term when he is sentenced Jan. 29.</p><p>In August, he stepped down from a Senate seat he had held for 18 years and said he would not run for re-election. His decision came weeks after a jury convicted him of acting as an agent of Egypt, taking bribes and obstructing justice, and left Mr. Murphy with the opportunity to install a temporary replacement in the narrowly divided Senate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/menendez-george-helmy-senate-seat.html" title="">governor declined</a> to appoint Mr. Kim, who won the Democratic primary with nearly 75 percent of the vote. Instead, Mr. Murphy named his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/nyregion/george-helmy-bob-menendez-murphy.html" title="">former chief of staff</a>, George Helmy, to the post.</p><p>Mr. Helmy has said he will resign after Tuesday’s vote is certified on Nov. 27.

For a time, he advised Gen. David Petraeus, then the commander of American forces in Afghanistan.
