People believe the election system is rigged.</h2><p>I talked to election officials in four battleground states. For many of them, going so far as to block certification wasn’t a partisan strategy; it was a patriotic duty. Though it might technically be illegal, many people felt that they obeyed a higher law. Over months of reporting, this is what I heard again and again. For all the cynicism involved in the effort to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss, and the groundwork being laid to challenge a possible defeat this year, many officials I spoke to were clearly motivated by a deeply held belief that a grand conspiracy was underway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/03/multimedia/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych/03Voting-Mag-TAKEAWAYS-diptych-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/5efc01c4-1e79-55d2-9d7a-8238100f28af" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Left: Bridget Thorne, a commissioner in Fulton County, Ga.

Mitchell, though her Election Integrity Network, has exhorted allies to get involved in elections at the state and the local level. “We are going to retake our election system,”<span>  </span>she said on her podcast, “one county at a time all over America.” </p><p>Once in place on local boards and commissions, they could push changes to voting rules or use their positions to run out the clock on the certification, creating chaos down the line. </p><h2 id="link-6defe7f0">They are trying to change the rules.</h2><p>For the better part of two centuries, American lawmakers and judges have said that the proper forum for contesting elections is the courts. Administrators must certify the results, even if they are flawed, and for good reason: Giving administrators the power to deny certification would mean giving them the power to deny the franchise.</p><p>But the modern “election integrity” movement has sought to give local officials more say over which votes count. The state board of elections in Georgia recently passed rules making certification more discretionary. Those rules <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/elections/georgia-election-rules-court-decision.html" title="">were blocked in court</a>, but the movement isn’t done trying.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-44734e1b">Some administrators are willing to face consequences for their efforts.</h2><p>Blocking certification carries risk of prosecution, but an increasing number of commissioners and board members have done so since 2020 — in at least 20 counties across eight states. </p><p>Though in almost all cases those people were outvoted by their fellow board members, the votes undermined a critical component of American elections. “The whole system is dependent upon, one, everyone doing what they’re supposed to do, and two, doing what a judge has told them they have to do,” Bradley Schrager, a Democratic election lawyer in Nevada, told me. “After that, we’re into something else.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Rutenberg is a writer at large for The Times and The New York Times Magazine and writes most often about media and politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-rutenberg">More about Jim Rutenberg</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/25/magazine/election-certification-deniers-trump.html">114</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/25/magazine/election-certification-deniers-trump.html">114</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
