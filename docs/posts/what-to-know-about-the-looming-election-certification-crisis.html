Its aim is to persuade the people who are responsible for certifying local elections of the false notions that widespread fraud is a threat to democracy and that they have the authority and legal duty to do something about it: Deny certification of their local elections.</p><p>Here are key takeaways from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/magazine/far-right-election-results.html" title="">full magazine investigation into the people who are putting themselves in place to deny election certification</a>.</p><h2 id="link-41c84806">Conspiracy theories are working. People believe the election system is rigged.</h2><p>I talked to election officials in four battleground states. For many of them, going so far as to block certification wasn’t a partisan strategy; it was a patriotic duty. Though it might technically be illegal, many people felt that they obeyed a higher law. Over months of reporting, this is what I heard again and again. For all the cynicism involved in the effort to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss, and the groundwork being laid to challenge a possible defeat this year, many officials I spoke to were clearly motivated by a deeply held belief that a grand conspiracy was underway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-138430e7">Deniers are taking over county and state boards that oversee elections. </h2><p>The post-2020 “voter integrity” movement has many leaders and includes many groups, but among the most important is Cleta Mitchell, who helped on Trump’s efforts to overturn his loss in Georgia. Mitchell, though her Election Integrity Network, has exhorted allies to get involved in elections at the state and the local level. “We are going to retake our election system,”<span>  </span>she said on her podcast, “one county at a time all over America.” </p><p>Once in place on local boards and commissions, they could push changes to voting rules or use their positions to run out the clock on the certification, creating chaos down the line. </p><h2 id="link-6defe7f0">They are trying to change the rules.</h2><p>For the better part of two centuries, American lawmakers and judges have said that the proper forum for contesting elections is the courts. Administrators must certify the results, even if they are flawed, and for good reason: Giving administrators the power to deny certification would mean giving them the power to deny the franchise.</p><p>But the modern “election integrity” movement has sought to give local officials more say over which votes count. The state board of elections in Georgia recently passed rules making certification more discretionary. Those rules <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/elections/georgia-election-rules-court-decision.html" title="">were blocked in court</a>, but the movement isn’t done trying.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bridget Thorne, a commissioner in Fulton County, Ga.
