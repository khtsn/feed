As he was arraigned, Mr. Weinstein sat next to his lawyers, only replying “not guilty.”</p><p>In 2020, Mr. Weinstein was convicted in New York of raping an aspiring actress in a hotel room seven years earlier. He was also convicted of assaulting a former television production assistant, who testified that he had forced oral sex on her in his Manhattan apartment in July 2006.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/25/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-appeal" title="">New York’s highest court found this year</a> that the judge who presided over the trial had erred by allowing prosecutors to call several accusers as witnesses, even though their allegations had not led to charges.</p><p>Immediately after the court’s April decision, the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that he would prosecute Mr. Weinstein again.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
