The number of people aboard has not been confirmed, but he said he did not believe there would be any survivors. The eight people injured were treated for smoke inhalation and injuries sustained from climbing out of a window. </p><p>When officials arrived at the crash site on Thursday morning, cars, lawns and several homes were on fire, and the time of the call — just before 4 in the morning — meant that many people were still asleep.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I can’t quite put words to describe what the scene looked like with the jet fuel running down the streets and everything on fire all at once,” said Scott Wahl, the San Diego police chief. “It was pretty horrific to see.”</p><p>Officials did not immediately say what had caused the crash. There was a dense fog in the San Diego area in the early morning hours and Mr. Eddy confirmed that a main power line had been hit.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.</p><p>The residential neighborhood is home to many military families, according to Robert Heely, a commanding officer of Naval Base San Diego. Toys, bikes and garden beds litter the lawns. On Thursday, some strollers and patio furniture were singed or covered in soot.</p><p>Julie Marconi, a young mother of two children, said that a neighbor came to wake her up about 15 minutes after the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“My neighbor’s husband came over and helped me grab the kids and the diapers, and we just ran,” Ms. Marconi said as she stood behind the yellow tape on Santo Road, half a mile from the crash site. “We live one street over from Sculpin and I can’t believe that a plane crashed on a quiet little street. If it weren’t for my neighbors, I don’t know what I would do.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Emergency responders were relieved to see that story played out across the neighborhood. Fast-acting families had jumped to action to wake up and help evacuate their neighbors. Remarkably, there were no serious injuries or deaths among those who live near the crash.</p><p>Cynthia Schmitz, 33, a resident of the Tierrasanta neighborhood, woke up to the crash.</p><p>“All we heard was the loud engine screeching noise, a loud boom — and the sky lit up,” she said. Ms. Schmitz, who is in the Navy, said she quickly realized that it had been a small plane crash.</p><p>“We see planes go over our house all the time,” she said, “so I figured that’s what it was.”</p><p>The 100 or so residents who were evacuated on Thursday morning have not yet been allowed back into their homes. Several blocks remain closed to traffic as debris is scattered on roofs, lawns and streets.</p><p>Burned cars littered the area, and firefighters were still struggling to extinguish a car on fire about four hours after the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt/22xp-sandiegocrash-pjlt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b2e079c7-5136-59c5-8f96-5d5e01740e4d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Authorities work the scene where a small plane crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, setting several homes on fire and forcing evacuations along several blocks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gregory Bull/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The plane had been attempting to land at the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, across a highway from where it crashed. It had departed from Teterboro, N.J., late Wednesday night with a layover at Colonel James Jabara Airport in Wichita, Kan., before flying toward San Diego, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking database.</p><p>The plane was built in 1985 and owned by Daviator, a limited liability company registered in Alaska, according to public records. The F.A.A. classified the company as a fractional ownership business, a popular arrangement in the aviation sector that allows people to buy a portion of a private plane.</p><p>Stacy Pack and her friend Anita Cruz were walking up Sculpin Street with their six children to see if they could get a glimpse of what was happening in their neighborhood. “I can’t believe what I’m seeing — this is a tragedy,” Ms. Cruz said. “I live a few blocks away, and I don’t know what I would have done if the plane crashed in my neighborhood.”</p><p>In October 2021, another small plane en route to the same airport <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/timeline-the-deadly-santee-plane-crash-in-east-san-diego-county/2743076/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crashed in the town of Santee</a>, northeast of San Diego, clipping a UPS truck and destroying two homes. The driver of the UPS truck and the pilot were killed in that crash.</p><p>Susan C.
