Ms. Schmitz, who is in the Navy, said she quickly realized that it had been a small plane crash.</p><p>“We see planes go over our house all the time, so I figured that’s what it was,” she said.</p><p>The plane had been attempting to land at the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, across a highway from where it crashed. The jet had departed from Teterboro, N.J., late Wednesday night with a layover at Colonel James Jabara Airport in Wichita, Kan., before flying toward San Diego, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking database.</p><p>Officials did not immediately say what caused the crash.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating.</p><p>In October 2021, another small plane en route to the same airport <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/timeline-the-deadly-santee-plane-crash-in-east-san-diego-county/2743076/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crashed in the town of Santee</a>, northeast of San Diego, clipping a UPS truck and destroying two homes.
