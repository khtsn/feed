The police did not say whether they believed the crash had been deliberate.</p><p>Other details about the driver, who was taken to a hospital, were not released.</p><p>The authorities asked people to avoid the city center on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Several recent ramming attacks had put Germans on edge ahead of national elections last month.</p><p>“Once again, we mourn with Mannheim. Once again, we mourn with the families of the victims of a senseless act of violence and fear for the injured,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in <a href="https://x.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1896600355376619942" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement.</a></p><p>Two weeks ago, a 24-year-old Afghan man who was seeking asylum intentionally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/munich-car-attack-who-what.html" title="">drove into a union demonstration</a> in Munich, killing a 2-year-old and her mother and wounding several dozen others.</p><p>And in December, a Saudi doctor who had been living in Germany for more than a decade was accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/world/europe/germany-christmas-market-attack.html" title="">driving his car into a Christmas market</a> in the central city of Magdeburg, killing six people and injuring hundreds of others.</p><p>Those attacks, by immigrants or foreign-born residents, raised questions about domestic security and immigration policy ahead of the elections, in which the hard-right Alternative for Germany party had its best showing ever.</p><p>Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany’s next chancellor after his party won the most votes in last month’s election, also expressed his sympathies. “This incident — like the terrible acts of the past few months — is an urgent reminder that we must do everything we can to prevent such acts,” he said in <a href="https://x.com/_FriedrichMerz/status/1896593109171024036" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> posted to X.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There have also been a number of vehicle attacks in the past years by German-born perpetrators. Five years ago, a man who had been living in his car drove <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/world/europe/germany-car-pedestrians.html" title="">into a crowd in Trier</a>, killing four. In 2018, a man with a history of psychological problems <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/world/europe/munster-germany-van.html" title="">plowed his van into a crowd in Münster</a>, in the country’s west, killing two.</p><p>In Mannheim, the driver reportedly entered a pedestrian-only stretch of the city center from its landmark water tower and drove roughly 700 yards toward the square known as Paradeplatz. The incident occurred at about 12:15 p.m., according to the police, when lunchtime crowds were enjoying unseasonably warm weather.</p><p>Detached pieces of the car could be seen along the vehicle’s path, video images showed.</p><p>A day earlier, a parade with 70 floats and 2,500 participants passed through the same zone in an annual carnival celebration. The police said about 250,000 people had attended.</p><p>Mannheim, which has a population of about 320,000, was in the headlines last year when an Afghan citizen living in Germany <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/europe/activist-officer-stabbing-germany.html" title="">stabbed people</a> at a far-right demonstration, killing a police officer who had rushed in to stop the attack.</p><p>After the events on Monday, the nearby city of Heidelberg canceled carnival celebrations scheduled for Tuesday.</p><p>“This is the second time within a year that our neighboring city has suffered such a terrible act of violence — in a situation like this, it was inconceivable for us to celebrate a happy carnival parade here in Heidelberg,” Mayor Eckart Würzner said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
