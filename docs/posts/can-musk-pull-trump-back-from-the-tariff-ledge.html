    <h1>Can Musk Pull Trump Back From the Tariff Ledge?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Elon Musk is known for many things. Subtlety is not one of them.</p><p>When Musk shared a grainy <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1909169096391811304" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two-minute video</a> at 4:59 a.m. Monday to his 218 million followers, his post contained no words, and yet the message was clear. It showed the free-market intellectual Milton Friedman, in a 1980 clip well known to economists, waxing poetic about free trade as he sketched out the international origins of the parts that form a pencil.</p><p>Musk was expressing his discomfort with President Trump’s imposition of draconian new tariffs. And yet one has to wonder what Musk hopes to accomplish.</p><p>This is not a president known to brook much public criticism, after all. Try to imagine Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, subtweeting her boss.</p><p>And Musk repeatedly went out of his way to disagree with Trump over the weekend, suggesting he believes he is not subject to the same rules that govern others in the president’s inner circle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Speaking by video on Saturday to an Italian far-right political conference, he said he hoped the United States and the European Union would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/musk-eu-us-tariffs.html" title="">“move to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone.”</a></p><p>And that came after Musk twice took shots on X at the administration trade hawk Peter Navarro: First, he ridiculed Navarro’s Harvard Ph.D. in economics as “a bad thing, not a good thing,” suggesting it meant Navarro’s ego exceeded his intelligence.</p><p>Then, in case anyone had not caught his drift, Musk arguably added a line to Navarro’s future obituary, saying he “ain’t built” anything, using an expletive for emphasis. (He later deleted the second insult.)</p><p>I’ve been covering the notoriously impulsive Musk for a while now. I don’t see a cogent strategy at work in making public his frustrations with his boss.</p><p>This is not the first time Musk has been at odds with Trump since joining his team, and publicly so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During the transition, Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/musk-trump-transition-mar-a-lago.html" title="">endorsed Rick Scott</a> of Florida to be the Senate majority leader, getting ahead of Trump, who did not support Scott. Then Musk <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/16/elon-musk-howard-lutnick-treasury-endorsement.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endorsed Howard Lutnick</a> for Treasury secretary, which Trump ignored in choosing Scott Bessent.</p><p>Most prominently, Musk vocally defended the H-1B visa program against the more anti-immigrant, MAGA wing of the Republican Party, saying he would go to “war” to defend the program, which is beloved by the tech industry. Trump eventually <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/elon-musk-vows-war-over-h-1b-visa-program-amid-rift-with-some-trump-supporters-2024-12-28/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sided with Musk</a>.</p><p>In the early days of the Trump administration, Musk also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-stargate-ai-announcement.html" title="">dissed a Trump artificial-intelligence manufacturing plan</a>. Trump gave him a pass for that one.</p><p>So does Musk have some secret plan here to get Trump to walk away from the ledge?</p><p>Trump has espoused tariffs and protectionism for decades. Musk’s online acting-out suggests he believes Trump’s stance may be negotiable assuming enough pressure is applied.</p><p>I have no doubt that Musk genuinely believes what he says about tariffs and trade. But it seems highly doubtful that a Milton Friedman video about a pencil will be able to change what Trump believes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest in Manhattan on Sunday against President Trump and Elon Musk.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Gray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>MEANWHILE on X</p><h2 id="link-2f2d9962">He protests the protesters too much</h2><p><em>Musk is using his X account as a megaphone. My colleague Kate Conger looks at how he is responding on the site to protests against his government cost-cutting efforts.</em></p><p>On Monday, Musk suggested in a series of posts that protesters had been paid to demonstrate against him, or had little idea about why they were protesting.</p><p>In one, he responded to a headline from his favorite right-wing satirical website that said the protesters were demanding government waste, writing “Seriously,” and adding a face-palm emoji. In another, he wrote that people protesting against him were full of “bitterness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He also shared posts from other X users claiming that the protests were staged, and asked, “Who are the key individuals funding this?”</p><p>The idea that someone is funding the opposition to him and his work has fascinated Musk in recent weeks. When protests cropped up at Tesla dealerships last month, he accused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/us/politics/george-soros-bragg-trump.html" title="">George Soros</a> and other Democratic donors of funding them.</p><p>These responses are characteristic of Musk, who often interprets disagreement with him as an attack. They also violate one of the internet’s cardinal rules: Don’t feed the trolls. Where other billionaires might ignore the criticism, Musk can’t seem to stop himself from responding to it — and bringing it more attention.</p><p>— <!-- -->Kate Conger</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>BY THE NUMBERS</p><h2 id="link-247246b0">$31 Billion</h2><p>That’s about how much Musk <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/billionaires-poised-to-lose-near-half-trillion-dollars-in-2-days" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has lost</a> in net worth since Trump’s tariff announcement, according to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>.

Musk agreed with the criticism, so much so that he tried to get out of the deal entirely.</p><p>But a funny thing happened. The company, now called X, has rebounded somewhat. And, as Kate Conger explains, that’s in large part because of Trump’s election, which she says had a “halo effect” on the company. The company still has problems, but Kate reports that Trump’s return to power has brought some advertisers back to the platform and made it newly relevant.</p><p>Musk often has a way of somehow forging his own luck. It’s not as if he saw this coming; Trump wasn’t even an official candidate for president when Musk bought Twitter in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It does raise a fun hypothetical though, one that I’ve thought about from time to time over the last few months: What would have happened to X, and to Musk, had Kamala Harris won in November?</p><p>Read Kate’s piece <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/technology/elon-musk-x-trump.html" title="">here</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering billionaires and their impact on the world.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump vs. the World:</strong> Times journalists Michael Barbaro, Peter Goodman and Astead Herndon dissect <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/trump-tariffs-trade.html">what’s at stake for consumers and businesses</a> caught up in the president’s trade war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Huge Tariffs, Small African Economies: </strong>The amount of manufactured goods exported from Africa to the United States is minuscule. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/business/economy/lesotho-trump-tariffs-trade.html">But for Lesotho, the impact of a 50 percent tariff is enormous</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Senate Republicans Question Tariffs: </strong>Some Republican senators on Capitol Hill, including one of President Trump’s most ardent supporters, have<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/economy/ted-cruz-trump-tariffs-republicans.html"> signaled their uneasiness to the sweeping global tariffs</a> that sent global markets reeling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Digital Commerce Companies</strong>: These businesses, including e-commerce platforms and payment processors, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/technology/tariffs-digital-commerce.html">pulling back on public offering plans</a> and bracing for pain.</p></li><li><p><strong> Investors Recoil: </strong>Stocks hadn’t fallen this far this fast since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.
