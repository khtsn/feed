</span> taking the final two playoff spots at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>, the Swiss stage has concluded. Following the day&#39;s matches, a live draw show was held to determine the opening playoff matches.</p>

<p>As was the case in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a> a year prior, the four first-seeded teams from each international league earned direct qualification to the playoffs. These teams were each matched up against one of the four teams that qualified out of Swiss. The first seeds were given the privilege of selecting their opponent, with the order of selection being randomly decided.</p>

<p>This is how the matchups shaped up in the order they were drawn:</p>



<p>With the first pick of the show, China&#39;s Xi Lai Gaming opted into playing Sentinels, who will play their third CN team in the row. Next was RRQ, who chose Wolves, the only non-Pacific team remaining, not wanting to play into the regional matchup. In a humorous twist of fate, G2 was the next to pick, and selected Paper Rex as their opponents, mirroring their infamous meeting in Shanghai. Finally, FNATIC, for the second year in a row, was left with the final pick, and once again left to play Gen.G, the scariest looking team coming out of Swiss.</p>

<p>The playoffs will follow a traditional eight team double-elimination bracket, and will span the next two weeks of competition. The first phase of the bracket will occur between June 13-17, narrowing down to the final four teams. The second phase of the bracket will take place between June 20-22, and will crown the champion of Masters Toronto.</p>
