</span> taking the final two playoff spots at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>, the Swiss stage has concluded. Following the day&#39;s matches, a live draw show was held to determine the opening playoff matches.</p>

<p>As was the case in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a> a year prior, the four first-seeded teams from each international league earned direct qualification to the playoffs. These teams were each matched up against one of the four teams that qualified out of Swiss. The first seeds were given the privilege of selecting their opponent, with the order of selection being randomly decided.</p>

<p>This is how the matchups shaped up in the order they were drawn:</p>



<p>With the first pick of the show, China&#39;s Xi Lai Gaming opted into playing Sentinels, who will play their third CN team in the row. Next was RRQ, who chose Wolves, the only non-Pacific team remaining, not wanting to play into the regional matchup. In a humorous twist of fate, G2 was the next to pick, and selected Paper Rex as their opponents, mirroring their infamous meeting in Shanghai. Finally, FNATIC, for the second year in a row, was left with the final pick, and once again left to play Gen.G, the scariest looking team coming out of Swiss.</p>

<p>The playoffs will follow a traditional eight team double-elimination bracket, and will span the next two weeks of competition. The first phase of the bracket will occur between June 13-17, narrowing down to the final four teams. The second phase of the bracket will take place between June 20-22, and will crown the champion of Masters Toronto.</p>

		<p>xlg crypto throwing? out of everyone why pick sen? why not wolves, a team you beat in your second last game? </p>

	<div data-post-id="5014239">
		
		
		<p>They want Revenge for China, probably saw something they think they could exploit though. Also Wolves isn&#39;t the  weakest team, I personally think it&#39;s PRX. </p>

	<div data-post-id="5014301">
		
		
		<p>TH looked like shit though, and GENG first map shouldn&#39;t have been close tbh. </p>

	<div data-post-id="5014283">
		
		
		<p>Even if they win there value and status will be dropped by everyone and if you want to win the tournament you have to face the stronger opponents and picking wolves same region team will bring more harm than any benefits.</p>

		<p>Sen Rrq G2 Geng, I think I’d love sen to lose for the China Revenge arc I just worry xlg might start slow, rrq wolves I think is closer then people think, wolves have momentum and if jemkin isn’t on his stage 1 form or the rest of the squad wobbles they could take it. G2 match up insanely well against prx and prx look exploitable in every game they’ve played bar a truly awful th. And geng look like by far the best team so far I think their favourites to make at least the upper final unless they run into G2 then I think the winner of that wins the UF.</p>
