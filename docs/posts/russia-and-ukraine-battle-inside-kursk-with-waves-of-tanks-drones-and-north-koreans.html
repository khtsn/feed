    <h1>Russia and Ukraine Battle Inside Kursk, With Waves of Tanks, Drones and North Koreans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Five months after Ukrainian forces swept across the border in the first ground invasion of Russia since World War II, the two armies are engaged in some of the most furious clashes of the war there, fighting over land and leverage in the conflict.</p><p>The intensity of the battles recalls some of the worst sieges of eastern Ukraine over the past three years, including in towns like Bakhmut and Avdiivka, names that now evoke memories of mass slaughter for soldiers on both sides.</p><p>The fighting, in the Kursk region of Russia, has taken on a layer of significance for the territory’s potential to play a role in any cease-fire negotiations. Facing the prospect of an unpredictable new U.S. president — who has vowed to end the war swiftly, without clarifying the terms — Ukraine hopes to use Russian territory as a bargaining chip.</p><p>Russia, relying on North Korean reinforcements, hopes to knock that territory out of Ukraine’s grasp.</p></div></div>
