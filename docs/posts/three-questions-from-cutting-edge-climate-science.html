    <h1>Three Questions From Cutting-Edge Climate Science</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Every December, more than 25,000 scientists from around the globe descend upon a cavernous convention center to eat dry sandwiches, drink weak coffee and ponder all things Earth and climate and space.</p><p>This is the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, a nonprofit organization for scientists, and it is the place to be if you want to hear about the latest research on topics like melting ice caps, prehistoric droughts and the long-term environmental effects of U.S. bombing in Vietnam and Laos, as seen from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666017224000270?via%3Dihub" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declassified spy satellite imagery</a>. It’s where new discoveries get a first airing and fledging ideas get hammered into shape.</p><p>Trying to summarize such a varied gathering would be a fool’s errand. Instead, here are three things I’ve been struck by this week at the conference, which runs through Friday in Washington.</p><h3 id="link-133ca22d"><span><strong>1. Why has the Earth been so much hotter than expected?</strong></span></h3><p>Every month for the past year and a half, the planet has been at or near its warmest point in modern times. This year is “<a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2024-virtually-certain-be-warmest-year-and-first-year-above-15degc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">virtually certain</a>” to end up as the hottest on record, according to the European climate monitor. Temperature records aren’t being broken; they’re being leapfrogged. And scientists haven’t quite pinned down why.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Tuesday at the conference, people packed a room to hear seven researchers from three continents share their latest thoughts and findings. By the end, the only thing everyone could agree upon was there was still more work to do.</p><p>This month, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq7280" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scientists in Germany</a> put forth a troubling new explanation for the heat: Cloud cover last year was at a record low. In other words, Earth absorbed extra energy because fewer clouds reflected it back to space.</p><p>Now scientists just have to figure out, “Why are the clouds being weird?” said Robert Rohde, chief scientist at the research organization Berkeley Earth. At the moment, we have possible answers — decreases in sulfur pollution and in Saharan dust in the atmosphere, perhaps — but no firm ones, Rohde said.</p><h3 id="link-42d603c8"><span><strong>2. How can A.I. help climate science?</strong></span></h3><p>Machine learning isn’t new to climate science, but researchers keep expanding what they can do with it. William Collins, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, gave a presentation about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03100" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new project</a> that uses A.I. to tackle a big problem: extreme weather.</p><p>The most devastating heat waves and storms are hard to study because, by definition, they don’t happen very often, so there isn’t a lot of real-world data on them. But with machine learning, you can essentially generate that data by replaying the same period of time over and over again, thousands of times, with slight differences each time, like “an A.I.-powered sequel to ‘Groundhog Day,’” as Collins put it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Given the concerns about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/climate/artificial-intelligence-energy-usage.html" title="">A.I.’s energy usage and carbon footprint</a>, Collins took pains to say that the computers that he and his colleagues use were “toys” compared with the ones that power ChatGPT and other commercial A.I. tools.</p><p>Scientists are still refining these methods to make sure they can help us understand our ever-warming climate, Collins said. “We’ve trained these models on the past,” he said. “Can they predict a future which has no analogue in the past?”</p><h3 id="link-748b474f"><span><strong>3. How should the scientific community think about geoengineering?</strong></span></h3><p>The Times has reported this year on a variety of Hail Mary techniques for slowing climate change: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/buying-time-geoengineering" title="">deflecting the sun</a>, tweaking the oceans, altering the DNA of living things. Talks on these strategies drew sizable audiences this week, though plenty of researchers grumbled in private about time and resources being put toward such risky ideas.</p><p>In October, the A.G.U. issued <a href="https://www.agu.org/Ethicalframeworkprinciples" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report on the ethics</a> of geoengineering research. And this week’s conference devoted one of its biggest and flashiest stages to a panel discussion on the topic.</p><p>The panelists had all studied geoengineering from different perspectives. Yet they made clear they weren’t onstage to promote its use.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Alan Robock, a climate scientist at Rutgers, put it bluntly: “I don’t want to be here,” he said. “We know the solution to global warming is to leave the fossil fuels in the ground.” Still, it’s important for scientists to understand the risks of trying these techniques, and how they stack up against the risks of not trying them, Robock said. “The sooner we know that, the sooner we can move on.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>THE CLIMATE FIX</p><h2 id="link-7bbb29d">A major solar project clears a very common hurdle</h2><p><strong>The problem: </strong>One of the biggest challenges that the U.S. solar industry faces isn’t really about technology. It’s about the time it takes to get projects approved and connected to the grid once built.</p><p>Hanging in the balance is the government’s goal of having a net-zero electric grid by 2035, which is going to require <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/100-percent-clean-electricity-by-2035-study.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">significantly boosting</a> solar’s footprint in the U.S.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>The fix: </strong>Oregon gave its final approval last month to build a 1,200-megawatt solar facility in the eastern part of the state that could generate enough electricity to power <a href="https://seia.org/whats-in-a-megawatt/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tens of thousands of homes</a>. It would be the biggest proposed solar and electricity-storage project in the country, according to Pine Gate Renewables, the company behind the proposal.</p><p>Getting the project approved wasn’t easy. Pine Gate was granted an important exception to Oregon land-use goals that are partly designed to preserve quality farmland. As part of its project, Pine Gate said it plans to pay up to about $11 million to help the local agriculture industry.</p><p>Outside of varying state and local regulations across the country, a common hurdle for solar projects is community pushback on new developments, or not-in-my-backyard concerns.</p><p>Pine Gate has “had a very good experience in Oregon, but wherever we’re developing projects, we kind of adjust our efforts” to the standards of the location, said Logan Stephens, vice president for project development at Pine Gate.</p><p><strong>The obstacles: </strong>Pine Gate’s project still took two and a half years to make it this far, including multiple public hearings. Oregon’s process for approving solar power sites is among the most rigorous in the country, Pine Gate has said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Solar energy projects around the country can also face delays in connecting to the electric grid. Utilities’ efforts to build the infrastructure to connect to these projects can also dictate how long a project takes, Stephens said.</p><p>On top of interconnection delays, the industry is also grappling with work force and equipment limitations, the Solar Energy Industries Association <a href="https://seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-q4-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a report</a> published this month. At the end of 2023, almost 11,600 energy projects were trying to connect to the grid, <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/Queued%20Up%202024%20Edition_R2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, which noted that wait times have been getting longer.</p><p><strong>What’s next: </strong>Pine Gate said it planned to start construction of the project in 2026.</p><p>Solar power last year <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accounted for roughly 3.9 percent</a> of utility-scale electricity generation in the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said it <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61242#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20new,476%20billion%20kWh%20in%202025." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a> solar power generation to increase 75 percent in 2025 over 2023. <em>— Allison Prang</em></p><h3 id="link-28a1cf58"><span><strong>Other Times climate coverage:</strong></span></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/climate/wright-trump-oil-gas-energy.html" title="">Trump’s Choice to Run Energy Says Fossil Fuels Are Virtuous</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/climate/alaska-common-murre-birds-ocean-heat.html" title="">Ocean Heat Wiped Out Half These Seabirds Around Alaska</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/supreme-court-epa-coal-ash.html" title="">Supreme Court Allows Biden Plan to Address Toxic Coal Ash</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-data-centers-power-plant.html" title="">Exxon Plans to Sell Electricity to Data Centers</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/energy-environment/britain-oil-clean-energy-transition.html" title="">Britain Promised Clean Energy, but It Still Needs Oil</a></p></li></ul><h3 id="link-4c1687aa"><span><strong>More climate news:</strong></span></h3><ul><li><p>The Postal Service’s electric mail trucks are way behind schedule, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/11/biden-usps-ev-oshkosh-climate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post reports</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-malawi-crop-insurance-climate-change/?srnd=phx-green" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg examines</a> how some nations’ drought insurance policies in Africa can leave millions without food.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Correction</em></strong><em>: The Tuesday newsletter misstated the name of a group that supports the movement to end fossil fuels.
