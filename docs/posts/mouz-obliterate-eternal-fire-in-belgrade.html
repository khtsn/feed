Trump in July first showed an interest in committing acts of public violence in 2019 but narrowed his focus to Mr. Trump after the announcement of his rally in Butler, Pa., according to an F.B.I. analysis of his electronics.</p><p>Investigators — who performed an exhaustive search of his devices and online accounts — do not believe that Thomas Crooks, the would-be assassin who was killed by a Secret Service sniper, was motivated by a specific political ideology. They have found no evidence that he had any co-conspirators or connections to a foreign plot, F.B.I. officials said during a call with reporters on Wednesday.</p><p>Soon after, the bureau for the first time released evidence photographs, including the shooter’s gun — a matte black Panther Arms AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle with a removable stock — the oversized black backpack found next to his body and an improvised explosive device found in the trunk of his car.</p><p>While Mr. Crooks’s motive remains opaque, his online searches reveal someone who was looking for an opportunity to pull off a spectacular attack that would garner widespread attention, by either inflicting mass casualties or killing someone famous. Thus far, that profile more closely resembles that of a mass shooter than a politically motivated assassin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Starting as a teenager in 2019 through this year, Mr. Crooks progressed from searching “detonating cord,” “blasting cap” and “how to make a bomb from fertilizer” to seeking detailed information about the activities and whereabouts of politicians in both parties. By late 2023, his search history included queries related to Mr. Trump, President Biden and both parties’ conventions, the officials said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The F.B.I. for the first time released an evidence photo showing Thomas Crooks’s rifle, broken down as he likely would have done for transport in his backpack.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">F.B.I.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We saw through our analysis of his online searches a sustained, detailed effort to plan an attack on some events, meaning he looked at any number of events or targets,” said Kevin P. Rojek, the special agent in charge of the bureau’s Pittsburgh field office.</p><p>When “the Trump rally was announced, early in July, he became hyper-focused on that specific event and looked at it as a target of opportunity,” Mr. Rojek added.</p><p>Mr. Crooks began searching for schedule information for both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden in April. But after the Butler rally was announced, he began to seek specific information on the placement of the podium, wind conditions and the layout of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/23/us/trump-shooting-gunman-snipers.html" title="">warehouse near the site of the rally</a> owned by AGR International. He also used an online ballistics calculator to help him plan his shot, investigators said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>An analysis of his search history, and several encrypted email accounts, has revealed no “definitive ideology,” Mr. Rojek added, “either left-leaning or right-leaning — it’s really been a mixture.”</p><p>Mr. Crooks, an intelligent but socially isolated 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pa., was able to climb onto the roof of the one-story AGR warehouse, which was just outside the perimeter of the rally at the Butler Farm Show property on July 13. He fired eight rounds before he was killed by a single shot from a Secret Service sniper. One of his shots grazed Mr. Trump’s ear; one audience member was killed, and several others were injured.</p><p>While most of the attention has moved to the string of failures and lapses that allowed him to get off a deadly volley so close to the stage, many questions remain about Mr. Crooks. He worked as a kitchen aide at a local nursing home, had access to his father’s legally obtained collection of firearms and appears to have been concerned about the state of his own mental health.</p><p>The gaps in the narrative have been filled, in some cases, by conjecture and conspiracy theories — including the possibility of a second gunman.</p><p>“There was no second shooter,” Mr. Rojek said. Of the 10 gunshots fired that day, eight came from Mr. Crooks’s semiautomatic rifle, one from the Secret Service sniper who killed him and one, fired by a local law enforcement official, did not strike anyone, he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Robert R. Wells, the assistant director of the F.B.I.’s counterterrorism division, said the bureau was taking the unusual step of providing updates on the investigation to push back against a tide of misinformation being promoted on social media.</p><p>Earlier this month, Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, who serves on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/us/politics/trump-assassination-task-force-visits-site.html" title="">congressional task force</a> investigating the assassination attempt, claimed that the F.B.I. had “cleaned up biological evidence” from the rooftop where Mr. Crooks had been killed and released his body to his family too quickly, which he said amounted to obstruction of justice.</p><p>F.B.I. officials said Mr. Crooks’s body had been turned over only after it had been thoroughly examined by Butler County, state and federal authorities. A toxicology report showed no traces of alcohol or illicit drugs, they said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
