Around 11 a.m. on Aug. 14, Ms. Chase embarked on a “solo journey” near Lone Cone Peak but was reported missing around 2 p.m. the next day after she did not return to camp, the sheriff’s office said.</p><p>On Saturday, after a multiday search that included K9 teams, aircrafts and drones, Ms. Chase was found “alive and uninjured,” officials said.</p><p>“Ms. Chase was part of a group of campers who, by design, set off alone into the backcountry without their cellphones and then fasting ‘to maximize their experience with nature,’” the authorities said in their post.</p></div></div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnimasValleyInst/posts/pfbid02PgX5GAqyxAvBjGpH8Ub5d8Nw7B8ZAc1pmEZvPLUb54eiXdUEHKgZQrzHG4jD6M2jl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On Facebook</a>, the Animas Valley Institute sought to clarify that it “is not a ‘spiritual camp,’” that “fasting is always optional and health-dependent,” that participants are required to carry a “signaling device” and that the group “will be initiating a thorough review of this incident that will include independent expertise.”</p><p>Animas did not respond to specific questions about the program that Ms. Chase was on, including whether there was fasting, and instead referred to its Facebook post.</p><p>“You should always bring technology for communications,” Sheriff Bill Masters said in his office’s Facebook post. “Furthermore you should not starve yourself even if a ‘guide’ service suggests the opposite of these basic safety rules.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.animas.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement on its website</a>, Animas thanked emergency groups for helping find Ms. Chase and added that the group “has run backcountry programs in Colorado since 1980 with no serious incidents.”</p><p>According to the sheriff’s office, Ms. Chase embarked on her solo journey on Wednesday with a day pack that contained “an emergency blanket, a whistle, a power bar, and some water.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>On the outing, campers used a buddy system to verify that each person had made it back to their campsite periodically, the sheriff’s office said. Ms. Chase’s buddy noticed on Thursday she had not returned, the authorities said.</p><p>A “quest,” as Animas calls its overnight journeys, typically costs $1,800 to $3,000, although the description for the specific journey Ms. Chase embarked on is no longer on its website.</p><p>Ms. Chase declined to comment.</p><p>“The Animas Quest catalyzes the encounter with soul by temporarily displacing everyday consciousness through five primary means,” <a href="https://www.animas.org/great-place-to-start/the-animas-quest/#:~:text=The%20Animas%20Quest%20catalyzes%20the,4)%20enacting%20a%20series%20of" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the website says</a>, listing solitude, fasting, exposure to nature, ceremonies and “soulcraft.”</p><p>In recent years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/travel/regenerative-tourism-retreats.html" title="">outdoor therapy</a> has become a popular form of tourism. Some other organizations have even promoted spirituality <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/us/psychedelic-drugs-church-religion.html" title="">through drug use</a>, leading to retreats that can cost $5,000 to $10,000 for seven days.</p><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
