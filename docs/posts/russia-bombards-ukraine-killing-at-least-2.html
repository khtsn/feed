The local authorities said two people also were killed in the city of Zaporizhzhia and that debris from downed missiles or drones sparked small fires in the capital, Kyiv.</p><p>Russia has over the past year fired large volleys roughly once a month in attempts to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defense systems with drones and missiles launched from multiple directions.</p><p>Many areas close to the front lines in Ukraine come under daily assault from Russian forces, but this week’s strikes have revived a broader sense of fear among civilians in bigger cities as air raid sirens blare, and drones and missiles tear into hotels and residential buildings. Attacks on energy infrastructure have disrupted water and power supplies, deepening the hardships of war.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“It was hard yesterday,” said Samir Mamedov, 33, a Kyiv resident who works in business development. “We were running to the shelter because it was a big bombing.” </p><p>But he added that people in his circle were now accustomed to the conflict. “Last year we thought that the war would be finished soon, but everyone is getting used to the idea that this war is not going to end,” he said.</p><p>The barrage that began on Monday comes at a tumultuous moment, just three weeks after Ukraine launched an incursion into the Kursk region of southern Russia.</p><p>The commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Tuesday that Ukraine has taken control of 100 settlements in Kursk. The Russian authorities have repeatedly insisted the situation was under control and that its forces were repulsing the attack. The claims could not be confirmed independently.</p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had promised a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/world/europe/russian-response-ukraine-incursion.html" title="">decisive response</a>, and his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, reiterated that message on Monday, saying that Russia would inflict “an appropriate response.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>It was unclear whether the attacks this week constituted that retaliation. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine vowed on Tuesday to “pay Russia back” for the strikes.</p><p>“Crimes against humanity cannot be committed with impunity,” Mr. Zelensky said in a <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/11465" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on Telegram</a>.</p><p>Since the incursion into Russia began, Ukrainian troops have gone beyond Kursk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">to the neighboring region of Belgorod</a>. On Tuesday, the regional governor of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukrainian forces had launched 23 drones and dozens of munitions at towns and villages in the area over the past 24 hours.</p><p>He also claimed there were reports of Ukrainian troops were <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1834319" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trying to break through the border</a> in the region, the Russian state news agency <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1834319" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tass reported</a>, saying that the situation remained “difficult but under control,” without elaborating. That claim could not be independently verified and there was no immediate comment from Russia’s Ministry of Defense or from Ukrainian officials.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A wounded person in Kryvyi Rih early on Tuesday. The local authorities said a ballistic missile attack there had killed two people and wounded five others.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>On Tuesday, Ukraine’s air force said it had <a href="https://t.me/kpszsu/18380" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shot down</a> five cruise missiles and 60 exploding drones, suggesting that the assault may have been smaller than the one the previous day, when Russia launched more than 200 drones and missiles. Mr. Zelensky called Monday’s attack “one of the largest” his country has faced since Russia’s invasion began 30 months ago.</p></div><div><div><p>At least four people were killed in Monday’s barrage, according to the Ukrainian authorities.</p><p> On Tuesday, air alarms went off throughout most of the country. In Kyiv, a loud explosion echoed in the downtown area around dawn. The city’s military administration said that the capital was under a “combined rocket and drone attack of the enemy,” and the authorities later said that falling debris from intercepted missiles or drones had set grass on fire in two city parks.</p><p>Ukraine relies on Soviet-legacy interceptors, which it had in great numbers before the invasion in 2022, and an array of Western-provided air defenses to shoot down incoming missiles and drones. They include long-range Patriots; the midrange NASAMS; and short-range, shoulder-fired Stingers, intended to prevent missiles from slipping through to hit targets. </p><p>Kyiv, though, has been attempting to ramp up its domestic military production to make itself less reliant on supplies from NATO allies.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky told journalists on Tuesday that the country’s defense industry had created and tested Ukraine’s first domestically produced ballistic missile. He gave no further details, and the claim could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Still, Ukraine’s relative success in shooting down the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missiles-kyiv.html" title="">incoming fire</a> is in large part a testament to the tens of billions of dollars in military aid the country has received since February 2024.</p><p>President Biden on Monday reiterated his “unshakable” support for Ukraine and said that his government would continue to lead a coalition of more than 50 nations that has rallied help for the country.</p><p>“I condemn, in the strongest possible terms, Russia’s continued war against Ukraine and its efforts to plunge the Ukrainian people into darkness,” he said, a reference to one of the main targets of Monday’s strikes: energy infrastructure.</p><p>The attacks this week came against the backdrop of grinding battles in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>One of Ukraine’s aims with the incursion into the Kursk region was to force the Kremlin to divert troops from the front lines in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, where they have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-incursion-pokrovsk.html" title="">advancing on the city of Pokrovsk</a>, an important transport hub for Ukrainian forces.</p><p>But Russia has been pressing on with its offensive in the Donetsk region. General Syrsky said that Russian forces were attempting to cut off a road that runs northeast from the city and is used as a resupply route, adding that Moscow is “increasing its presence on the Pokrovsk front.”</p><p>Military analysts have for months argued that Ukrainian military resources are already stretched thin, raising questions about whether it can continue attacking inside Russia while maintaining its defenses in the east.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
