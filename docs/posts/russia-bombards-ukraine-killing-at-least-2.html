In Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, debris from downed missiles or drones sparked brush fires in parks, while air alarms were set off throughout most of the country. </p><p>Russia has over the past year fired large volleys roughly once a month in attempts to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defense systems with combinations of drones and missiles launched from multiple directions.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The barrage that began on Monday comes at a tumultuous time for both sides, just three weeks after Ukraine launched an incursion into the Kursk region of southern Russia.</p><p>The commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Tuesday that Ukraine has taken control of 100 settlements in Kursk. The Russian authorities have repeatedly insisted the situation was under control and that its forces were repulsing the attack. </p><p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had promised a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/world/europe/russian-response-ukraine-incursion.html" title="">decisive response</a>, and his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, reiterated that message on Monday, saying that Russia would inflict “an appropriate response.”</p><p>It was unclear whether the attacks this week constituted that retaliation, though President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine — who called Monday’s barrage of ballistic and cruise missiles was “one of the largest” his country has faced since Russia’s invasion began 30 months ago — vowed to “pay Russia back” for the strikes.</p><p>“Crimes against humanity cannot be committed with impunity,” Mr. Zelensky said in a <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/11465" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on Telegram</a> on Tuesday, adding that at least 16 people had been wounded.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Since the incursion into Russia began, Ukrainian troops have gone beyond Kursk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">to the neighboring region of Belgorod</a>. On Tuesday, the regional governor of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukrainian forces had launched 23 drones and dozens of munitions at towns and villages in the area over the past 24 hours. </p><p>He also claimed there were reports of Ukrainian troops were <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1834319" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trying to break through the border</a> in the region, the Russian state news agency <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1834319" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tass reported</a>, saying that the situation remained “difficult but under control,” without elaborating. That claim could not be independently verified and there was no immediate comment from Russia’s Ministry of Defense or from Ukrainian officials.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A wounded person in Kryvyi Rih early on Tuesday.

The city’s military administration said that the capital was under a “combined rocket and drone attack of the enemy,” and the authorities said that falling debris from intercepted missiles or drones had set grass on fire in two city parks.</p><p>While Ukraine’s military has not yet said how many missiles and drones it intercepted on Tuesday, it said on Monday that it had shot down 201 of the 236 missiles and drones launched by Russian forces, a high success rate.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ukraine relies on Soviet-legacy interceptors, which it had in great numbers before the invasion in 2022, and an array of Western-provided air defenses. They include long-range Patriots; the midrange NASAMS; and short-range, shoulder-fired Stingers, intended to prevent missiles from slipping through to hit targets.</p><p>Ukraine’s relative success in shooting down the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missiles-kyiv.html" title="">incoming fire</a> is in large part a testament to the tens of billions of dollars in military aid the country has received since February 2024 from its allies in NATO and, in particular, the United States.</p><p>President Biden on Monday reiterated his “unshakable” support for Ukraine and said that his government would continue to lead a coalition of more than 50 nations that has rallied help for the country.</p><p>“I condemn, in the strongest possible terms, Russia’s continued war against Ukraine and its efforts to plunge the Ukrainian people into darkness,” he said, a reference to one of the main targets of Monday’s strikes: energy infrastructure.</p><p>The attacks came against the backdrop of grinding battles in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>One of Ukraine’s aims with the incursion into the Kursk region was to force the Kremlin to divert troops from the front lines in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, where they have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-incursion-pokrovsk.html" title="">advancing on the city of Pokrovsk</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But Russia has been pressing on with its offensive in Donetsk. On Monday, Mr. Zelensky said that Ukraine would send reinforcements to Pokrovsk in a bid to shore up the beleaguered city’s defense.</p><p>Military analysts have for months argued that Ukrainian military resources are already stretched thin, raising questions about whether it can continue attacking inside Russia while maintaining its defenses in the east.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
