But a much more detailed and disturbing series of accounts by multiple women who allege that Gaiman raped, pressured, abused and assaulted them was published by New York magazine on Monday. The article describes alleged abusive behavior by Gaiman toward women who claim he forced them to perform degrading acts, including licking vomit off his lap, and in some cases pressured them into sexual situations while his young son was present in the room.</p><p>Some prominent writers — among them <a href="https://x.com/jk_rowling/status/1878849906087207015" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">J.K. Rowling</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffvandermeer.bsky.social/post/3lfnbbw2v6c2m" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jeff VanderMeer</a>, Maureen Johnson and Naomi Alderman — denounced Gaiman’s behavior and criticized the literary world’s tepid response to the allegations. Others <a href="https://www.facebook.com/216179/posts/10107815482572073/?mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=hM7X8bRsPw4aWTNu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that prize committees should rescind some of Gaiman’s literary awards. Some booksellers wondered whether they should stop carrying his books, which have sold tens of millions of copies globally and include children’s books, comics and beloved fantasy novels like “American Gods” and “The Graveyard Book.” Appalled fans vowed they would no longer buy or read Gaiman’s work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While some of Gaiman’s television and film projects <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/business/neil-gaiman-allegations.html" title="">were dropped</a> following the initial allegations, the responses from his publishers, agents and professional collaborators have been far more subdued.</p><p>Gaiman’s lawyers did not respond to a request for further comment.</p><p>HarperCollins, which has published many of his <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/collections/books-by-neil-gaiman" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most notable works</a>, and Marvel, the comic book publisher, have no new books forthcoming with Gaiman, according to representatives from the companies.</p><p>His literary agent at Writers House, which represents blockbuster authors like Dav Pilkey, Nora Roberts and Ally Condie, did not respond to requests for comment about whether the agency would continue to represent him. Norton, which published an illustrated edition of Gaiman’s “Norse Mythology” last November, did not respond when asked whether the company would publish Gaiman’s works in the future. DC Comics, which published his blockbuster comic book “The Sandman,” along with other works, declined to comment when asked whether DC would continue to publish him.</p><p>For some of the women who have accused Gaiman of misconduct, the muted responses from his publishers and collaborators are a bitter disappointment.</p><p>Katherine Kendall, 36, was one of the women interviewed by Lila Shapiro for the New York magazine story. She met Gaiman when she was 22, while volunteering at one of his book events in Asheville, N.C., where she still lives. She described how, at another reading, 10 months later, Gaiman — whom she’d grown up reading and admiring — pulled her to the back of his tour bus and “lay on top of her.” According to Kendall, he said, “Kiss me like you mean it” and “I’m used to getting what I want.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to the article, Gaiman later gave Kendall $60,000 to pay for therapy in an attempt, as he put it in a recorded phone call, to “make up some of the damage.”</p><p>In the comment posted on Tuesday, Gaiman did not address specific allegations, but said that he reviewed the messages he exchanged with some of the women “following the occasions that have subsequently been reported as being abusive,” and that the messages reflect “entirely consensual sexual relationships” that “seemed positive and happy on both sides.”</p><p>In an interview with The Times, Kendall described the “culture of secrecy” around Gaiman. “Neil’s works were his bait, and promotional events were his hunting ground,” she said. “As long as his publishers and professional collaborators remain silent, Neil will continue to have unrestricted access to vulnerable women.”</p><p>Kendra Stout, another one of the women, told the magazine that in 2007, Gaiman forced her to have sex with him while she “had developed a UTI that had gotten so bad she couldn’t sit down.” The article states that, this past October, Stout filed a police report in which she accused Gaiman of raping her.</p><p>“The silence of the community around him — his fandom, his publishers — is loud and disturbing,” Stout said in an interview with The Times. “I’ve heard that it was an open secret that he was a predator, but that whisper network did not reach me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some booksellers were torn over whether they should continue to stock Gaiman’s books. Lauren Nopenz, the manager and buyer at Curious Iguana, a bookstore in Frederick, Md., said the store would no longer carry Gaiman’s books on its shelves, but would order copies for customers who request them. “We don’t want anyone to come into the store and see books that make them feel uncomfortable,” Nopenz said. Sarah Bagby, the owner of Watermark Books in Wichita, Kan., said her store would keep selling Gaiman’s work as long as there was customer demand, but might not promote his books heavily. “It’s a predicament, but we’ll carry him,” she said.</p><p>On social media, a number of authors expressed their shock and horror over the allegations. But some authors who were friends of Gaiman’s held back. The married writers Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon, who hosted Gaiman’s 2011 wedding to the musician and writer Amanda Palmer at their home, said they were still processing the reports.</p><p>“I’m just trying to absorb all this and don’t know what to say,” Waldman wrote in an email.</p><p>Chabon responded similarly: “I just don’t have it in me to talk about it.”</p><p>Palmer, who separated from Gaiman several years ago, declined to comment through a spokesperson, who said that “while Ms. Palmer is profoundly disturbed by the allegations that Mr. Gaiman has abused several women, at this time her primary concern is, and must remain, the well-being of her son and therefore, to guard his privacy, she has no comment on these allegations.”</p><p>After Gaiman published his statement, in which he noted that “I could have and should have done so much better” in his relationships with women, some of the women who have come forward said they were let down but not surprised.</p><p>Stout shared a statement from several of them — a few couldn’t be reached — responding to Gaiman’s post. It read, “We are disappointed to see the same non-apology that women in this situation have seen so many times before.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabeth Egan is a writer and editor at the Times Book Review.
