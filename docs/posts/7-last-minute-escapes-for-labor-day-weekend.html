There are good reasons many destinations across North America won’t fit the bill. Wildfires are burning in some parts of the West, tropical disturbances are brewing in the Caribbean, the East Coast’s coastal retreats are packed, and much of the South is sweaty and oh so steamy. But if you’re still hoping to stretch out the last days of summer, there are places that are not too hot, not too crowded and not necessarily that far away.</p><p>Here are seven inspirations in North America for a Labor Day getaway.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Looking Glass Falls, in Pisgah National Forest.

American goldfinches and Carolina chickadees sing high above waterfalls framed by lush green trees, and babbling streams pour down moss-covered rocks hiding salamanders, newts and crayfish.</p><p>During the summer, these wooded areas are chock-full of children at summer camp, and the trails are often busy with hikers. But by Labor Day, most of the kids have returned home, while the weather is often perfect, with average temperatures in the seventies. You have your pick of activities — bird-watching, fly fishing, waterfall dousing and hiking.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Easy trails can be found at the <a href="https://www.ncarboretum.org" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">North Carolina Arboretum</a>, but for a shaded, moderate hike to a waterfall in which you can douse, check out <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recarea/?recid=81789" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Catawba Falls Trail</a>. For another moderate hike (but no swimming), there is <a href="https://www.blueridgeparkway.org/poi/linville-falls/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Linville Gorge and Falls</a>, nicknamed the Grand Canyon of the Southern Appalachians. Advanced hikers can summit the 6,684-foot <a href="https://www.hikewnc.info/besthikes/black-mountains-toe-river/mount-mitchell" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mount Mitchell</a>, the highest peak in the Eastern United States, in Mount Mitchell State Park, which is surrounded by Pisgah Forest. </p><p>Later, make your way back to <a href="https://www.exploreasheville.com/iconic-asheville/downtown/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asheville</a>, where a robust restaurant and brewery scene offers a perfect setting for sharing stories of your day. Local favorites include <a href="https://curatetapasbar.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cúrate</a> for upscale tapas, <a href="https://chaipani.com/asheville" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chai Pani</a> for Indian food and <a href="https://www.wickedweedbrewing.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wicked Weed Brewing</a> for hoppy deliciousness.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Walking or biking across the Golden Gate Bridge, one of San Francisco’s best-known attractions, is a popular activity for city visitors.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>California</p><h2 id="link-4e33db51">See San Francisco’s best-loved sights</h2><p>“The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco,” may be a clichéd phrase, but anyone who has visited this California city during the summer most likely experienced fog, dank air and brisk wind. But September and October are San Francisco’s warmest and brightest months of the year.</p><p>A long weekend is just enough for first timers to sample the city’s best-known attractions. Walk or bike across the <a href="https://www.goldengate.org" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Gate Bridge</a>. Board a <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/cable-cars" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cable car</a> as it clangs up and down the city’s hills. Explore <a href="https://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alcatraz Island</a> on a three-hour tour (book ahead). Take in the <a href="https://www.fishermanswharf.org" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fisherman’s Wharf</a> area, which may be less chaotic with many children back in school. Watch a home game of the San Francisco Giants at <a href="https://www.mlb.com/giants/ballpark" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oracle Park</a>, right on the bay. Or check out the <a href="https://presidio.gov/explore/attractions/presidio-tunnel-tops" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Presidio Tunnel Tops</a>, a newly developed stretch of national park land featuring stunning panoramic views.</p></div></div><div><p>The city is a particularly special destination for those interested in L.G.B.T.Q. history. The <a href="https://www.glbthistory.org/museum-about-visitor-info" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GLBT Historical Society Museum</a>, nicknamed the Queer Smithsonian, is a good place to start, as is a stroll through <a href="https://castrocbd.org/visit-the-castro/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Castro</a> neighborhood or a stop at the Castro’s first gay bar, opened in 1963 as the <a href="https://www.sfgayhistory.com/neighborhoods/castro/castro-gay-bars/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Missouri Mule</a> (now called Beaux).</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The clear waters of Keuka Lake stretch about 20 miles and draw visitors with water activities like swimming, paddling, kayaking and fishing. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>New York</p><h2 id="link-3f10faa7">Swim, fish, boat, then sip, at the Finger Lakes</h2><p>One of the largest <a href="https://www.visitfingerlakes.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Finger Lakes</a> in upstate New York, <a href="https://www.visitfingerlakes.com/plan-your-trip/finger-lakes-facts/keuka-lake/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keuka Lake</a> stretches about 20 miles and draws visitors with clear-water swimming, paddling, kayaking and fishing.

Sure, there’s great hiking and canyoning, but there aren’t many towns where you can stroll down Main Street and stop into a boutique for shopping, a cafe for coffee and a hot springs for soaking. <a href="https://www.visitouray.com/ourayhotspringspool" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ouray Hot Springs Pool</a> is sulfur-free — in other words, no rotten-egg stink — and offers not just one pool but many: The family-friendly pools feature water slides, a volleyball net and a rolling log, while the adults-only soaking section is kept between 102 and 106 degrees.</p><p><a href="https://montroseairport.com/211/2024-Summer-Flight-Schedule" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Montrose Regional Airport</a>, about an hour’s drive from Ouray, has direct flights to Chicago, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Along with shopping, the Polanco neighborhood also delights visitors with the grand Palacio de Bellas Artes, a cultural center and museum.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adrian Wilson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Mexico</p><h2 id="link-2693c4dc">Sample delicious urban delights</h2><p>You won’t scratch the surface of what Mexico City offers in a long weekend, so consider tossing away those checklists and instead soak up the atmosphere in one or two neighborhoods.</p><p>Start by signing up for the city’s bike share app, <a href="https://ecobici.cdmx.gob.mx/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ecobici</a>, for an easy way to get around town. The <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/et3Zn4UNc5rGm6gi9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roma</a> neighborhood, a favorite among travelers, has shaded, walkable streets; inviting plazas; and some of the city’s best restaurants.

Even if a corner spot looks shabby, it might be producing food that could rank among the best bites you’ve ever had.
