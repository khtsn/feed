The research in the field was cutting edge, the universities were highly ranked and overseas students were welcome in the country, where international education has been referred to as “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=931255694993572" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the biggest export</a> we don’t dig out of the ground.”</p><p>Mr. Bajwa arrived a decade ago, specializing in weed control. He brought his family over, all becoming naturalized citizens. He spent years in Wagga Wagga, a rural town, working for the state government and continuing research in weed science. He now teaches at La Trobe University in Melbourne and is a homeowner.</p><p>But those hoping to follow Mr. Bajwa’s path face a new reality.</p><p>Politicians on both sides of the aisle have turned to capping the number of international students as a way to rein in unaffordable housing, a crisis that is at the top of voters’ minds ahead of next month’s election. The argument is that this will reduce demand for rentals and starter homes and tamp down prices. It is a major shift for Australia, whose economy depends on mining but which once saw education as a “<a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-3072804430/view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">super growth sector</a>” and sought to compete for students with the United States, Britain and Canada.</p><p>“We gain a lot more than we lose to international students,” said Mr. Bajwa, 35. “There should be a lot more focus on improving the selection criteria or requirements than a blanket ban or limiting the number.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last year, the government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sought to to impose a limit on international students but failed to pass legislation. It has since increased student visa fees and slowed processing, reducing the arrival of students from overseas. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has pledged to put far stricter restrictions on international students, slashing the number by a further 30,000, for a cap of 240,000 new arrivals a year — and more than tripling the maximum visa fees to up to 5,000 Australian dollars, about $3,200.</p><p>Strict border controls during the coronavirus pandemic kept many international students out. But Australia then made a concerted effort to bring them back — temporarily removing work restrictions and offering rebates on visa fees. That led to a record surge of students arriving in the country in 2023 and 2024, with total international student enrollment topping a million for the first time last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Students at La Trobe University in Melbourne.

The United States is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/student-visas-social-media.html" title="">scrutinizing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/student-visas-revoked-trump-administration.html" title="">revoking</a> student visas in drastic fashion, casting the right to study in the country as a privilege that can be taken away seemingly arbitrarily; Canada has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/world/canada/canada-immigration-policy.html" title="">put the brakes</a> on the influx of students from abroad; Britain has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-student-visa-route-will-reduce-net-migration" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">installed new restrictions</a> that it said would prevent people from using student visas to come work in the country.</p><p>Australia had long allowed and even encouraged major universities to become dependent on international students to expand their campuses and research programs. Foreigners pay much higher fees than domestic students and contribute a substantial portion of the schools’ revenue.</p><p>“International students in Australia had been used for quite some time as a form of an export industry,” said Peter Hurley, a professor of education policy at Victoria University. “The same way they’re promoting the sheep industry, it’s been the same with international education.”</p><p>The post-pandemic surge in international students coincided with an acute housing affordability crisis in Australia. Home values have soared compared with incomes, <a href="https://www.anz.com.au/content/dam/anzcomau/bluenotes/documents/ANZ_CoreLogic_%20Housing_Affordability%20Report_November-2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rising about 45 percent from 2020</a>. Sydney was the <a href="https://fcpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-Demographia-International-Housing-Affordability.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second least-affordable city</a> in the world after Hong Kong in 2023, based on a comparison of median home prices to median incomes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sydney was the second least-affordable city in the world after Hong Kong in 2023, according to one study.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hollie Adams/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>While multiple factors have contributed to the crunch in housing supply — including labor shortages, rising construction costs and <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/research/completed/housing-construction/housing-construction.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regulatory issues</a> — international students have made for an expedient, nonvoting segment to target as a quick fix for politicians.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That sentiment was reflected in a question put to Mr. Albanese, of the center-left Labor Party, and Mr. Dutton, who leads the Liberal Party, in their first debate of this election cycle.</p><p>“We have a lot of students who are here visiting who are buying housing within the city area,” <a href="https://youtu.be/q90uP_Rv1tI?t=2627" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> a 74-year-old woman named Janine, who said she was concerned about her children and grandchildren’s ability to ever be able to afford a home. “When is one of our governments going turn up and say, Australia belongs to Australians?”</p><p>Andrew Norton, a professor of higher education policy at Monash Business School, said there was no question that the number of students arriving in the country — many of them wanting to remain in the country after graduation — was contributing to the demand side of the housing shortage.</p><p>At the same time, he said, the current spike is an aberration because of pent-up demand during the pandemic and fewer students returning home. The proposed caps, he added, would be a short-term solution rather than the more thoughtful, comprehensive migration policy reform that is needed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Critics have also noted that international students largely occupy apartments and share houses concentrated near the universities that would typically not be the types of homes sought out by first-time home buyers.</p><p>Clifford Suryana, a fourth-year student at the University of Sydney studying law and commerce who is from Surabaya, Indonesia, said he had learned English from Australian teachers who lived in his hometown. When it came time to think about university, he said he felt a general affinity for Australia and also felt there were business and diplomatic ties with Indonesia that would lend themselves to career opportunities.</p><p>Many of his fellow international students, who make up <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/nearly-half-of-sydney-uni-s-students-come-from-overseas-20240520-p5jf3n.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly half</a> of the student body at the University of Sydney and account for four-fifths of the school’s tuition fees, contribute far more to Australian society than they take from it, he said.</p><p>“Most of them would want to work in Australia or go back to their original country with knowledge they got from Australia,” he said. “In my perspective, that would only be good for Australia.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">Victoria Kim</a> is the Australia correspondent for The New York Times, based in Sydney, covering Australia, New Zealand and the broader Pacific region.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/anthony-albanese">Anthony Albanese</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/peter-dutton">Peter Dutton</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>False Claims and Global Aims: </strong>A Times investigation shows Therme, a European firm which runs a spa and water park in Romania, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/canada/therme-spa-ontario-canada.html">exaggerated its track record in securing a deal with Ontario</a>, and government auditors found that the process had been unfair and opaque.</p></li><li><p><strong>Odes to Mexican Drug Lords: </strong>Mexican artists built enormous audiences singing about drug cartels and narco culture. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/americas/mexico-narcocorridos-ban.html">Cities and states are now moving against the style</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Debate on Sex and Gender: </strong>President Trump and right-wing politicians in Europe have railed against trans rights. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/europe/uk-trans-hungary-germany-us.html">Britain’s top court has now added its voice to the discussion</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
