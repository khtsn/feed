That claim has angered many Israelis because it created the perception of a conflict of interest; for years, Qatar has hosted leaders of Hamas.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s recent efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-shin-bet-firing.html" title="">fire the head of the Shin Bet</a>, the Israeli internal security agency, has compounded the furor.

Both Egypt and Qatar have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/world/middleeast/us-egypt-qatar-cease-fire-deal.html" title="">mediated between Hamas and Israel</a> since late 2023 and have not always worked in lockstep.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Urich and Mr. Feldstein were arrested on Monday and a judge extended their detention by three days on Tuesday. Lawyers for both men declined to comment.</p><h2 id="link-77eef08d">Who are the advisers?</h2><p>Mr. Urich is a former media officer for the Israeli military who has become one of Mr. Netanyahu’s most trusted strategists. He helped mastermind the prime minister’s communications strategy through several recent elections. In his autobiography, Mr. Netanyahu described him as “kind of family.”</p><p>In addition to his government job, Mr. Urich also <a href="https://www.perception.media/jonatan-urich" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">works for Perception</a>, a public relations firm owned by another sometime adviser to the prime minister, Srulik Einhorn. Asked for comment, Mr. Einhorn said that Perception had never worked for Qatar.</p><p>Mr. Feldstein is also a former military press officer, and began working as a liaison between military correspondents and the prime minister’s office at the start of the war. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-leaks-explained.html" title="">arrested in a separate case</a> last fall, on suspicion that he leaked classified information to a foreign newspaper.</p><h2 id="link-1cd4efb9">What is Qatar’s role?</h2><p>The court records do not suggest that Qatar worked directly with Mr. Netanyahu’s aides.</p><p>Instead, the records state that the aides were directed by ThirdCircle, a U.S.-based lobbying group that represents Qatar in various countries, <a href="https://efile.fara.gov/docs/6540-Exhibit-AB-20250114-9.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including the United States</a>. Court records show that ThirdCircle paid Mr. Feldstein via an Israeli intermediary.

In that case, he is accused of granting regulatory favors to businessmen and media executives in exchange for bribes and positive coverage. He denies those charges.</p><h2 id="link-5f94b4fe">What is the Shin Bet’s role?</h2><p>Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet, has been closely involved with the investigations into the aides.</p><p>When Mr. Netanyahu tried last month to fire the agency’s director, Ronen Bar, it fueled accusations that he was punishing Mr. Bar for pursuing the cases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators in Jerusalem last month protesting attempts to dismiss the head of the Shin Bet and the attorney general.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronen Zvulun/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Netanyahu denied the claim. He said that Mr. Bar was being fired because of a breakdown of trust between the two men and because of lapses by the Shin Bet in the hours preceding Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-45af2f4f">Why has the case touched a nerve?</h2><p>For years, Qatar has hosted senior members of Hamas. Since 2018, Qatar has also sent more than $1 billion in aid money to civilians in Gaza.</p><p>U.S. officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/16/world/middleeast/doha-qatar-blockade.html" title="">quietly supported</a> the first arrangement and the Israeli government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html" title="">directly requested</a> the second. Still, Mr. Netanyahu’s opponents are furious that officials privy to Israeli state secrets might simultaneously represent a country that works so closely with an Israeli enemy.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s clash with the Shin Bet has also created the perception of a conflict of interest. More generally, the case has amplified criticism that he is fighting too many personal battles to govern effectively. And it has exacerbated fears that Mr. Netanyahu’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-shin-bet-firing.html" title="">broader effort to overhaul the judiciary</a> is rooted in personal grievance.</p><p>Myra Noveck<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> from Rehovot, Israel.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Ronen Bergman is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, based in Tel Aviv.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ronen-bergman">More about Ronen Bergman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/shin-bet">Shin Bet</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Driving in Singapore: </strong>The city-state, where it costs up to $84,000 just for the right to own a car, is one of the most expensive places to drive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/car-certificate-singapore-luxury.html">That is by design</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Radio Martí Goes Off the Air: </strong>For four decades, a U.S.-financed broadcaster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/americas/radio-marti-cuba-trump-castro.html">provoked the ire of the communist government</a> in Cuba.
