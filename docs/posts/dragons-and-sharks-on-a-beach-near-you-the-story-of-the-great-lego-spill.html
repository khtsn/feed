Years ago, during visits to her parents’ home in Devon, she regularly took her children beachcombing. They looked for shells, sea glass and interesting pebbles. Then, in 1997, Lego pieces started washing up.</p><p>“We knew it’s from a cargo spill, but I didn’t know much more about it,” she said, adding that her children would fill up small plastic buckets with their beach treasures.</p><p>“I hadn’t really forgotten about the Lego story,” she said, “but it was when I came here to Cornwall and saw it washing up again and I just thought, That’s astonishing, you know, that 13 years later and this Lego was still appearing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Her find sparked an idea: creating a community to trace who else had found Lego, which pieces they had found, and where. She created a Facebook page, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28367198" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBC reported on it</a>, leading to a flood of submissions.</p><p>People found tiny, colorful octopuses, dragons, life rafts, scuba flippers, scuba tanks, sea grass and more, and they enthusiastically reported their finds to the page. “At last,” read a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LegoLostAtSea/posts/pfbid02D7XLT4oCh6LuUWgak363gU41CeimiEr7C2ZLLKJYxZu8b4TVrZv7VdvfZ2kzoMGFl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blurb</a> from a recent find, “after years of searching I find my very first piece of lego, lost at sea.” The endeavor became a widely followed project and led to a book titled “Adrift: The Curious Tale of the Lego Lost at Sea.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More than 33,000 black dragons and just 514 green ones were traveling on the Tokio Express.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guy Martin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yellow life rafts were among the Lego pieces on the ship.

She’s mapped where the toys have turned up — on the English coast, in Wales, France, Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands. But it’s possible pieces have drifted all over the world by now.</p><p>For Curtis Ebbesmeyer, there’s no doubt about it. Dr. Ebbesmeyer is an oceanographer known for tracking the <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2021/summer/rubber-duckies-ocean/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Friendly Floatees Spill in 1992</a>, in which thousands of rubber ducks and other bath toys washed into the Pacific Ocean. He said ocean currents were “like the world’s greatest subway line.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“They take anything, anywhere,” he said.</p><p>After the Cornwall spill, Dr. Ebbesmeyer reached out to Lego to ask what had been on the ship. The company sent him an inventory, along with a sampling of the kinds of pieces that had been in the container. He promptly tested them in his bathtub for buoyancy and found that half of the pieces floated.</p><p>That difference could account for the missing Lego pieces that fell off the Tokio Express in 1997 and have yet to surface. Ms. Williams said she regularly spoke to fishermen who discovered the pieces as they trawled the bottom of the ocean. A Lego shark, one of 51,800 that were in the container, was caught in a fisherman’s net 20 miles off the Cornish coast in late July. It’s the first of the sharks to see daylight in 27 years.</p><p>“Only another 51,799 to find,” Ms. Williams wrote on the <a href="https://x.com/LegoLostAtSea/status/1819450030249365667" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lego Lost at Sea account</a>.</p><p>Andrew Turner, a professor of marine and environmental biogeochemistry at the University of Plymouth in England, said the Great Lego Spill was an interesting case study because of the public’s knowledge about it. Often, container spills aren’t made public unless there’s something hazardous or toxic inside. It’s also the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to plastic pollution in the ocean, he said.</p><p>“There’s so much plastic on the bottom of the ocean that we just don’t know anything about, and how much is there, and when and if it’s going to wash up,” Professor Turner said.</p><p>The container mishap created an expected public relations challenge for the company that makes the toys. Calling the Great Lego Spill “an unfortunate accident,” a spokesperson for the Lego Group said the company didn’t “ever want Lego bricks to end up in the sea.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“We are serious about our role in helping to look after the planet,” the spokesperson said. “We have an ambitious sustainability strategy that aims to leave a positive impact for future generations.”</p><p>Christopher M. Reddy, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said that scientists were still forming an understanding of how plastic affects the ocean and marine life. The plastic pieces — which can be mistaken for food by wildlife, or even become small enough to enter the body through the gills — are harmful, but Dr. Reddy said the most worrying threat to the ocean was the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that’s fueling climate change.</p><p>Rob Arnold, an artist in Cornwall, creates work from plastics he has recovered from the English coast. He is looking to both reduce marine plastic pollution and spread awareness about it. Armed with garbage bags and sheer grit, he goes out on long, sometimes arduous walks. He climbs over rocks to reach hidden coves where trash piles up, collecting water bottles, plastic teeth, bottle caps and, yes, Lego.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rob Arnold, an artist in Britain who uses discarded plastic in his artwork, walked along a cliff of a secluded stretch of coastline collecting plastic and trash.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guy Martin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Arnold collecting trash along the beach. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guy Martin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Arnold has created an hourglass filled with plastic pellets, called nurdles; a Stonehenge built out of lighters; and a piece with nearly 1,000 Lego flippers, or scuba fins, arranged neatly in rows.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guy Martin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He is a reluctant artist.
