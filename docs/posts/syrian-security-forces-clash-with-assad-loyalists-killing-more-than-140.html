The area has become a tinderbox since Mr. al-Assad was overthrown in early December.</p><p>The clashes began on Thursday afternoon after Assad loyalists killed 16 security personnel for the government in the Latakia countryside, the deadliest attack yet on Syria’s new security forces, according to the war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and government officials. The government responded in force, deploying scores of security personnel in the countryside and directing thousands more from other cities to the coast as they tried to reestablish authority over a handful of towns and villages where armed gunmen had effectively seized control overnight.</p><p>By Friday afternoon, Syrian authorities still had not wrested back full control over some areas, raising the specter that the new authorities could lose control over the coast. Armed Assad loyalists were also holding several security personnel hostage in Jableh, a coastal city in Latakia province where they had effectively seized control, according to Nour al-Din Primo, a spokesman for the government in Latakia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Most residents in Tartus and Latakia were sheltering in their homes on Friday, as military convoys patrolled the streets and security forces conducted “combing operations” to root out armed remnants of the Assad era, according to the state news media.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>By Friday, the government had deployed more security personnel to places like Tartus, Syria, as they tried to regain government authority over a handful of towns and villages where armed gunmen had effectively seized control overnight.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The clashes set off competing protests across the country, as thousands of people poured into the streets of major cities on Thursday night and Friday, either to show their support for government forces or to demand that those forces stand down and withdraw from the coastal countryside.</p><p>Those were the first wide-scale demonstrations against the new authorities since they assumed power in December.</p><p>The fighting has become a flashpoint for the fractious nation as it emerges from a nearly 14-year civil war and more than 50 years under Assad family dictatorships. The flaring tensions have become a critical test for the new leaders, whose rebel coalition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/assad-syria.html" title="">toppled Mr. al-Assad</a> and installed an Islamist transitional government that has sought to consolidate control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“From the very first day, we have been and continue to face both a covert and open war aimed at breaking the will of the Syrian people,” Syria’s interim foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani, said in a post on X on Friday.</p><p>The war has been fought by “sowing chaos on one hand, and attempting political isolation abroad on the other,” he added. “I reassure our people that Syria today has passed the test once again and is forging a way toward the future with strength and determination.”</p><p>The coastal provinces have posed a significant challenge for the Sunni Muslim-led government as it exerts its authority. The region is the heartland of Syria’s Alawite minority, including the Assad family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstration on Thursday against militants loyal to the Assad family, in Idlib.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Despite making up only 10 percent of the country’s population, the Alawites exerted outsize influence over the country during the Assad family’s rule. The Alawites, who practice an offshoot of Shiite Islam, dominated the ruling class and upper ranks of the military under the Assad government.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The new government has called on all members of Mr. al-Assad’s security forces to relinquish their ties to the former government and surrender their weapons at “reconciliation centers.” While thousands have taken part in that process, some remnants of the former government’s security forces have not.</p><p>In recent weeks, armed men affiliated with the Assad government have carried out sporadic hit-and-run attacks on security forces from Syria’s new authority in Latakia and Tartus. But the ambush on Thursday afternoon appeared to be the most coordinated attack yet and came amid calls among some Assad loyalists to organize themselves against the new government.</p><p>The clashes that followed on Thursday night were a drastic escalation of those low-simmering hostilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man handing in his firearms at a reconciliation center in Damascus, in December.

A few hours later, the loudspeakers of some mosques broadcast a message calling on government forces to abandon their weapons and leave the town.</p><p>Armed men surrounded the district center, where a handful of government security forces were stationed, according to Mr. Subh and other residents.</p><p>By dawn on Friday, the government forces had abandoned their posts in Draykish and gunmen had set up checkpoints along major roads in the town, residents said.</p><p>“No one knows how the events escalated so quickly,” Mr. Subh said. “Who coordinated it? Who attacked? No one is entirely sure.”</p><p>The overnight skirmishes came hours after security personnel conducted an operation in the Latakia countryside to arrest an official from the Assad government, according to a government official who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>As the security forces left one village, Beit Aana, gunmen ambushed their convoy, said village residents and the official. At least 16 security personnel were killed, according to the war monitor.</p><p>The Beit Aana ambush set off additional clashes between government forces and armed Assad loyalists in rural Latakia.</p><p>Artillery and machine-gun fire rang out across the area throughout the afternoon as hundreds of people from Beit Aana and nearby villages fled to the countryside,<em> </em>the residents said. It was not immediately clear whether any civilians or Assad loyalists had been killed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Government security forces in Latakia, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karam Al-Masri/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>In Tartus, a port city, protesters on Thursday night chanted, “One, one, one — Tartus and Jableh are one,” referring to the area, Jableh, where the clashes had unfolded, according to residents.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In other parts of the country, including the central city of Homs and northwestern Idlib, thousands of people joined protests to support the government. In the capital, Damascus, a crowd of protesters gathered at Umayyad Square on Friday afternoon, some calling for a crackdown on armed remnants of the Assad government.</p><p>The new authorities “don’t have to make any negotiated settlement with the remnants of the regime,” said Rateb Katat, 25, a protester in Damascus. “They don’t have to forgive them now. They offered them forgiveness at first and look at what they did.”</p><p>The escalating hostilities sent a sense of panic into communities in Latakia and Tartus, where many do not support the armed remnants of the Assad government. Few people ventured outside their homes in most cities on Friday, as security convoys patrolled the streets.</p><p>“There’s total curfew in the area,” said Ahmad Qandil, a local Alawite leader in Jableh, adding that most people in the town wanted the situation to be stabilized and did not support an armed uprising against government forces.</p><p>“We want safety, security” more than anything else, including money for basics like food, he said. “The situation is very confusing.”</p><p>Reham Mourshed contributed reporting from Damascus and <!-- -->Hwaida Saad<!-- --> from Beirut, Lebanon.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
