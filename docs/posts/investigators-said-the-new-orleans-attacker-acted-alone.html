The attacker was captured on surveillance video placing explosives in the city’s French Quarter, but the explosives never went off, officials said.</p><p>Investigators identified the driver as Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, 42, of Beaumont, Texas. He served eight years in the military and deployed to Afghanistan. He said in a video posted online that he had joined the Islamic State terrorist group and had originally planned to hurt his relatives and friends. Jabbar was killed in a gunfight with police. Here’s what else we know <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/suspect-new-orleans-texan-isis-flag.html" title="">about him</a>.</p><p>The attack killed a woman set to begin nursing school, a father of two and a former college football player, among others. This is what we’ve learned so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/us/new-orleans-attack-victims.html" title="">about the victims</a>.</p><p>This afternoon, the city sought to move forward. Less than a mile away from the site of the attack, tens of thousands of fans gathered at the Superdome for the rescheduled Sugar Bowl, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/us/sugar-bowl-new-orleans-attack.html" title="">observed a moment of silence</a> before the kickoff. Bourbon Street, the location of the attack, reopened and within hours it was buzzing again. “I don’t know that the magnitude of the whole thing really sets in yet,” a bar owner there said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pete Kiehart for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-26918939">Mike Johnson is trying to unite Republicans behind him</h2><p>Before Congress can do anything this year — including certify the election results — the House must elect a speaker.

Officials said Livelsberger shot himself in the head immediately before the vehicle was engulfed by fire.</p><p>The F.B.I. said it had not found a connection between the explosion and the truck attack in New Orleans early on New Year’s Day.
