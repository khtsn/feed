Over the course of its 153-year history, the building has also been a butcher shop and a supplier of valves and transistors. Now it’s taking on a new identity: live-in art gallery. On a warm October night during the city’s Frieze Art Fair, the curator <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rajan_bijlani_/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rajan Biljani</a>, 40 — who has owned the property since 2014 — invited 150 guests to his home for the opening of an exhibition showcasing work from South Asian diaspora artists, including Harminder Judge and Vipeksha Gupta, alongside rare furniture pieces by Pierre Jeanneret and Le Corbusier collected from Chandigarh, the Modernist city in India conceived in 1947 by the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. “I wanted to share the house and honor the fact that it was an artist’s studio,” says Biljani of his motivation for turning his residence into a by-appointment gallery.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Tony Cox’s Club Rhubarb on New York’s Lower East Side, Lola Montes’s “Artichoke Candleholders Italy” (2023) sit on her “36.

Ferry</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Since the early 20th century, coinciding with the rise of abstraction, the art world has adhered to the notion that works should be displayed in deliberately featureless, generally white-walled spaces, the better to elevate and isolate them from the context of daily life. Now, however, a growing number of gallerists and curators are, like Biljani, taking the opposite approach, exhibiting in the very places where daily life dominates: their own homes. In Manhattan’s Financial District, the dealer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michaelbargo/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Bargo</a>, 41, sells rare furniture out of his one-bedroom apartment. In Los Angeles’s Frogtown, the collector <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonathanpessin/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan Pessin</a>, 54, has converted his residence into a veritable bazaar of vintage design objects. And on New York’s Lower East Side, the pro skater turned artist and gallerist Tony Cox, 49, runs <a href="https://www.instagram.com/clubrhubarb/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Club Rhubarb</a> — a tiny, deliberately hard-to-find contemporary art gallery — out of his sixth-floor abode. There is some precedent for the idea: The Parisian antiques dealer <a href="https://www.florencelopez.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Florence Lopez</a>, 65, for example, has used her Paris home — a former sculpture studio in the Sixth Arrondissement — as a showroom for clients like Charlotte Gainsbourg since 1995. But now, whether driven by skyrocketing rents, a collective urge to experiment or a longing to encourage active participation with the art, the concept is taking hold.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Florence Lopez’s home and showroom in Paris, where the offerings include a Charlotte Perriand bed and Mathieu Mategot mirrored coat rack, both from 1950.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philippe Garcia</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the entryway of Alex Tieghi-Walker’s apartment gallery in New York’s TriBeCa, Vince Skelly’s Seventh Street Chair and Leo Kaspar and Andrew Pierce Scott’s Standing Lamp.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ike Edeani</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Finances were one motivation for the Welsh-born design dealer and curator Alex Tieghi-Walker, 37, to turn his fifth-floor loft in TriBeCa into <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tiwa_select/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tiwa Select</a>, an exhibition space where he’s mounted shows by the lighting designer Lindsey Adelman and the sculptor Vince Skelly, among others. But for Tieghi-Walker, running his business out of his home is also more comfortable. “I’ve always felt like an outsider in the gallery world,” he says. “For me, it makes sense putting [these works] in a domestic context.” The setup has allowed him to develop more meaningful relationships with clients, whom he often hosts for impromptu lunches or intimate dinner parties. “I get a lot of joy from having people come over, take books from shelves,” he says. “I love seeing how people interact with the art and the space in the course of a day.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An installation view of Laëtitia Badaut Haussmann’s 2022-23 exhibition “Sec &amp; Metallic” at Emanuela Campoli’s apartment in Milan.

It created this strange sense of intimacy.”</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the foyer of Danny Kaplan’s home showroom on Lafayette Street in Manhattan, his DKS Eloise Lamp sits atop his DKS custom credenza.

In NoHo, the designer and artist Danny Kaplan, 41, is gut renovating a 3,600-square-foot spread on the fourth floor of a prewar cast-iron building to create an apartment-cum-exhibition space for his work. Best known for his graceful, organic-shaped ceramics and lighting, he’s now branching out into larger-scale furniture, which inspired the project. “I had all these ideas of things I wanted to make in my head, but there was no space for them,” says Kaplan, who will maintain his current production facility in Bushwick. At first, he was hesitant about being so enmeshed with his work but, in the end, he decided that living among his pieces could only be a boon for his practice. “I think it’ll teach me a lot about designing for real living,” he says.</p></div></section></article></div>
