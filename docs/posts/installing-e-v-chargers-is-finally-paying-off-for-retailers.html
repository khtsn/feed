They have begun building charging stations under their own brand names rather than relying on providers that lease a part of their parking lots to install and maintain the stations.</p><p>“Companies are beginning to see charging as something that can potentially help the bottom line,” said Graham Evans, a director at S&amp;P Global Mobility, an automotive market research firm. “It’s going to become more ubiquitous rather than a token gesture.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>EVgo has begun to experiment with a prefabricated model of a charger, first installed at a site in League City, Texas, in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Richard Beaven for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The embrace of charging comes as more Americans — many of whom are worried about a warming planet — trade in their gas-powered cars. In 2023, <a href="https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1.4 million</a> plug-in electric vehicles were sold in the United States, more than 9 percent of all car sales that year and an increase of over 50 percent from 2022, according to Argonne National Laboratory, a federally funded research center. And although the growth of E.V. sales has slowed this year, an <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2024-ev-sales/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20latest%20counts,from%207.8%25%20in%20Q3%202023" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated 346,309 of the vehicles were sold in the third quarter</a>, nearly 9 percent of sales, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. (It is too soon to say what impact Donald J. Trump’s election will have on sales, but during his campaign he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-would-consider-ending-7500-electric-vehicle-credit-2024-08-19/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a> that if he became president he would end the Biden administration’s policies that encourage E.V. manufacturing and sales.)</p><p>Some of the slowdown in E.V. sales this year can be chalked up to drivers who hesitate to trade in their gas-powered cars because of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/06/27/about-3-in-10-americans-would-seriously-consider-buying-an-electric-vehicle/#:~:text=Concerns%20about%20limited%20EV%20charging,support%20large%20numbers%20of%20EVs." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concerns about E.V. charging infrastructure</a>, which has grown more slowly than E.V. sales. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/business/energy-environment/electric-vehicles-broken-chargers.html" title="">Broken</a> chargers have been a problem: One in five ports does not work when motorists pull up, according to <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/bigs/the-state-of-ev-charging-in-america" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent research</a> led by a Harvard Business School fellow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In total, over <a href="https://driveelectric.gov/stations" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">200,000 public chargers are spread across about 74,000 stations</a>, but more than a million public chargers will be needed by 2030 to keep up with E.V. sales, researchers at the <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> have estimated.</p><p>Even with the Biden administration’s $5 billion <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12744" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plan</a> to fill in the infrastructure gap, a robust national network is still years away. Under that plan, states are required to submit proposals for charging operators and site hosts. Nearly 60 percent of the grants have gone to fuel and convenience stores, rest stops and service plazas, according to EVAdoption, a data and analytics firm. Still, only one in every 14 big-box locations offers charging, while one in every 15 grocery stores and one in every 40 department stores do, a <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/research/cr-report-charging-the-future-the-role-of-retail-in-our-ev-transition/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consumer Reports analysis</a> found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Retailers are embracing charging as more Americans, many of them worried about a warming planet, trade in their gas-powered cars.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Richard Beaven for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For many retailers, charging deficiencies present an opportunity: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/business/truck-stops-electric-vehicles.html" title="">Truckers</a>, <a href="https://www.evgo.com/press-release/evgo-recognizes-massive-rideshare-growth-as-commercial-throughput-more-than-tripled-year-over-year-in-q1/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ride-hailing drivers</a> and people on long-distance trips rely on public chargers, as do the 5 percent of E.V. owners <a href="https://pluginamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Plug-In-America-EPRI-EV-Driver-Survey-Report_Final.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who are not able to charge at home</a>, many of whom live in apartment buildings and park on the street. The most frequently used public chargers are at retailers, according to a 2024 study of usage data by J.D. Power, a data analytics company.</p><p>Some landlords of shopping centers and malls have found that installing chargers on their properties has helped to attract new tenants, said Jim Hurless, a managing director who oversees the E.V. business at the real estate firm CBRE.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But installing the chargers is complicated and expensive. The process involves surveying, engineering, permitting, connecting with local utilities, testing and inspection — and can take up to 18 months from start to finish. Slower chargers — considered a good fit for cinemas and hotels, where a customer parks for a few hours or overnight — can cost up to $7,000 to install. Fast chargers, which can provide a significant charge in 20 minutes, can cost as much as $175,000.</p><p>Many retailers turn the project over to a charging company that pays them a monthly fee for the parking spaces used while retaining any revenue from customers. And those providers have been installing more, and faster, chargers and promising a more reliable, and in some cases plusher, customer experience than in the past.</p><p>Mercedes-Benz is investing $1 billion on the first phase of a new network of high-speed chargers that can accommodate all brands of vehicles. Its charging stations will have lounges — and landscaping — at some locations. The automaker has installed charging hubs at a dozen Buc-ee’s gas and convenience stores in the Southeast, with plans to expand to more than 40 additional sites. Starbucks, which had <a href="https://about.starbucks.com/stories/2024/find-an-ev-charger-at-starbucks-stores-from-seattle-to-denver/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Volvo</a> install 15 stations on properties between Seattle and Denver, will work with Mercedes to add <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mercedes-benz-high-power-charging-and-starbucks-team-up-to-launch-an-elevated-ev-charging-experience-across-america-302199243.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100 more</a>, including on Interstate 5 on the West Coast.</p><p>Some charging companies are developing methods to speed up installations.

Walmart expects to spend $1 million to $1.5 million at each site.</p><p>“Charging can be a profitable stand-alone business,” Mr. Kapadia said. “The ancillary benefits are driving traffic to our locations.”</p><p>Even Costco, one of the first retailers to install charging stations in the 1990s, before <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/citing-a-lack-of-usage-costco-removes-e-v-chargers/" title="">ripping them out</a> in 2011 because the company said they were rarely used, has recently returned to E.V. charging.

Power, said: “Fifteen years ago it may have not made the most sense to add charging. Now it makes sense.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
