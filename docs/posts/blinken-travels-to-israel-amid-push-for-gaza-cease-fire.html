    <h1>Blinken Travels to Israel Amid Push for Gaza Cease-Fire</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was heading to Israel on Sunday to try to clinch a deal that could end the war in Gaza, even as the Middle East remained on edge amid the looming threat of wider regional conflict.</p><p>The visit, part of an intensive diplomatic campaign led by the Biden administration, comes days after Israel’s negotiating team held talks in Qatar with senior American officials, as well as Qatari and Egyptian representatives who are mediating between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>Those talks ended <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/middleeast/cease-fire-talks-doha-israel-hamas.html" title="">without a major breakthrough</a>, but the White House said in a statement on Friday that the United States had put forward a “bridging proposal,” with Egyptian and Qatari support, intended to close remaining gaps between the sides. It said teams would continue to hash out details for implementing the deal and that senior negotiators hoped to reconvene in Cairo before the end of this week to finalize an agreement.</p><p>In a statement issued on Saturday night, after the sabbath, the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Israeli negotiating team had expressed “cautious optimism” over the possibility of advancing toward a deal based on the bridging proposal. It did not offer further details, and portrayed Hamas as the obstacle to reaching an agreement.</p></div></div>
