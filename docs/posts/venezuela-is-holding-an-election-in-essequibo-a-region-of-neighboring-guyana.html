Essequibo is internationally recognized as part of neighboring Guyana, not Venezuela.</p><p>Most countries and the 125,000 people who live in Essequibo all agree: It belongs to Guyana, a country of about 800,000, not Venezuela, a nation of roughly 28 million.</p><p>In staging legislative and regional elections on Sunday, including in Essequibo, Venezuela’s autocratic president, Nicolás Maduro, analysts say, is seeking to legitimize his rule abroad and also within his deeply dissatisfied nation, where the military’s loyalty is reportedly fraying.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last year Mr. Maduro declared victory in a presidential election but did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/world/americas/venezuela-election-maduro.html" title="">not provide any evidence</a> to support his claim. Instead, tallies collected by election monitors showed that his opponent had won in a landslide. Many countries, including the United States, did not recognize Mr. Maduro as the winner.</p><p>Of particular concern to Venezuela’s government, according to analysts, were vote counts the opposition collected from military barracks showing that a large portion of the armed forces voted against Mr. Maduro.</p><p>Mr. Maduro is using the vote in Essequibo to stir nationalistic sentiment and build support for his government, said Benigno Alarcón, the director of a research center at Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas, which conducts voter surveys.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police and national guard officers next to a mural reading, “Essequibo belongs to Venezuela” during a protest in Caracas this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Barreto/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Claims to the Essequibo region are deeply ingrained among many Venezuelans who believe the land was historically theirs under Spanish colonial rule and do not consider a 19th-century agreement that ceded the area to Guyana as legitimate.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Essequibo election “is a way of trying to unify the people and especially the armed forces against a common enemy,” Mr. Alarcón said.</p><p>But most people who live in Essequibo speak English, identify culturally as Guyanese and say they want to remain part of Guyana — the only country most have ever known. Even under Spanish rule it was considered a remote outpost. Across Guyana, shops and cars are plastered with stickers proclaiming the country’s ownership of Essequibo.</p><p>In recent years, Mr. Maduro has ramped up claims to the region, which comprises about two-thirds of Guyana and includes enormous offshore oil blocks where Exxon Mobil is expanding production.</p><p>In 2023, Mr. Maduro reignited the long-running dispute by holding a referendum asking voters whether his government should pursue its claim to Essequibo. The vote was seen as an effort to help divert attention from Venezuela’s political and economic crises.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela speaking after a referendum on Venezuelan sovereignty over Essequibo in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pedro Rances Mattey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The country’s electoral authority said that 95 percent of voters had approved of making the claim, but observers said that turnout was actually low.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Now Mr. Maduro is again stoking a geopolitical crisis as a way to shift the domestic conversation, analysts said.</p><p>While most Venezuelans favor taking back the Essequibo, Mr. Alarcón said their trust in the government’s intentions and capacity to do so was low.</p><p>“It is an issue that has been losing connection with the people, because a lot of time has passed,” he said. “We have been discussing this for 100 years. Many people already feel that this is a very difficult issue to reverse.”</p><p>On Election Day, Venezuelans along the border region with Guyana will choose among four candidates for governor, including the governing party’s candidate, Neil Villamizar, a Navy admiral. Voters will also select eight legislative representatives from the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It is unclear exactly how Venezuela plans to administer elections in a territory governed by a different country, and Venezuela’s electoral authority has not provided clear information.</p><p>“It doesn’t make any sense,” Mr. Alarcón said.</p><p>Guyana’s national security minister, Robeson Benn, has said that border security was tightened and that the authorities would arrest any Guyanese person supporting the election.</p><p>The modern-day dispute over the Essequibo dates back to 1899, when a Paris tribunal determined the internationally recognized border. But many Venezuelans say the decision was null and void, because it involved a secret deal that Venezuela did not participate in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>High school students in Georgetown, Guyana, attending a job fair in 2023.

But years of U.S. sanctions, mismanagement and infrastructural decay have left it in ruins. Unlike Mr. Chávez, Mr. Maduro must contend with a collapsed economy and widespread public discontent.</p><p>In 2020, the dispute between the two countries over Essequibo was taken up by the United Nations’ top court, the International Court of Justice, where it is still pending. This month, the court ordered Venezuela to refrain from electing officials to oversee the area. But Mr. Maduro has rejected the court’s jurisdiction over the issue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man with his fishing boat near oil rigs in Cabimas, Venezuela, in 2022.

Venezuela is holding its election one day before Guyana’s Independence Day.</p><p>“Our region is high on the alert,” she said “We’re here and we’re not giving up any mountain. We’re not giving up any tree. We’re not giving up any river that belongs to the Essequibo. It’s ours.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Genevieve Glatsky is a reporter for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
