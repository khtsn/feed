    <h1>McConnell Defends Polio Vaccine, an Apparent Warning to RFK Jr.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. McConnell, 82, contracted polio as a child, more than a decade before the vaccine became widely available. When his left leg was paralyzed, his mother took him for treatment in Warm Springs, Ga., at the same treatment center frequented by another famous polio survivor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p><p>Although Mr. McConnell eventually recovered, the lingering effects of the disease followed him into adulthood, leaving him with a wobbly, uneven gait. He has spoken often of the experience.</p><p>“From the age of 2, normal life without paralysis was only possible for me because of the miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother’s love. But for millions who came after me, the real miracle was the saving power of the polio vaccine,” Mr. McConnell said.</p></div></div>
