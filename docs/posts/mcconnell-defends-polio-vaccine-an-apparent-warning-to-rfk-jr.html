Kennedy Jr. has petitioned federal regulators to withdraw the vaccine from the market.</p><p>Without naming Mr. Kennedy, Mr. McConnell suggested that the petition could jeopardize his confirmation to be health secretary in the incoming Trump administration.</p><p>“Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed — they’re dangerous,” said Mr. McConnell, who is stepping down as his party’s Senate leader next month but could remain a pivotal vote in Mr. Kennedy’s confirmation. “Anyone seeking the Senate’s consent to serve in the incoming administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has said he does not want to take away anyone’s vaccines. His lawyer, Aaron Siri, filed the petition in 2022 on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network, a nonprofit run by Mr. Kennedy’s former communications director. Mr. Siri is advising Mr. Kennedy as he vets candidates for the Department of Health and Human Services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. McConnell, 82, of Kentucky, contracted polio as a child, more than a decade before the vaccine became widely available. When his left leg was paralyzed, his mother took him for treatment in Warm Springs, Ga., at the same treatment center frequented by another famous polio survivor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p><p>Although Mr. McConnell eventually recovered, the lingering effects of the disease followed him into adulthood, leaving him with a wobbly, uneven gait. He has spoken often of the experience.</p><p>“From the age of 2, normal life without paralysis was only possible for me because of the miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother’s love. But for millions who came after me, the real miracle was the saving power of the polio vaccine,” Mr. McConnell said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 13, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article and an accompanying picture caption and headline mischaracterized Senator Mitch McConnell’s leadership status. He remains the Senate Republican leader until next month; he is not the former leader.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Sheryl Gay Stolberg covers health policy for The Times from Washington.
