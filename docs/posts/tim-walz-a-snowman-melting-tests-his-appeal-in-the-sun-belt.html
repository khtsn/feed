Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate, many Democrats hoped that his folksy charm, quick-witted jabs at Republican opponents and “Minnesota nice” values would draw in white, working-class voters from across the Midwest — and potentially beyond.</p><p>That theory has been put to the test in recent weeks as Mr. Walz has hit the campaign trail, embracing his role as a retail politician and attack dog against former President Donald J. Trump at stops not only in the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but also in Sun Belt battleground states like Arizona and Nevada. This week, he will head south to campaign in Georgia and North Carolina.</p><p>“I feel a bit like a snowman melting,” Mr. Walz said at several stops during a sweltering campaign swing in the Southwest last week, a line that drew chuckles from college students in Tempe, Ariz., and wealthy donors in Las Vegas alike.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People wait to hear from Democratic vice-presidential nominee Minnesota Governor Tim Walz at a presidential debate watch party in Mesa, Ariz. last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caitlin O&#39;Hara/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>As he has traveled through the nation’s battlegrounds, Mr. Walz has worked to overcome skepticism from moderate voters about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/us/politics/tim-walz-liberal.html" title="">Minnesota’s leftward shift</a> by presenting liberal policy priorities like student debt relief and housing tax credits as common-sense, neighborly goals. And across the Sun Belt in particular, he has had to try to shore up support among a much younger and more racially diverse electorate — traditionally Democratic groups with whom Republicans have been making inroads in recent elections.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On the trail, where he has worked to pump up the Democratic base at events and to rally the faithful with visits to campaign offices, he often works to forge connections with his audiences, and individual voters, with a down-to-earth demeanor and a dose of humor.</p><p>At a campaign office in Phoenix, he laughed with a volunteer from Minnesota as they commiserated about the triple-digit temperatures. At an office for a Democratic group in Lansing, Mich., he marveled at the endless stream of volunteers emerging from a room to shake his hand.</p><p>“That’s either a big room or it’s a clown car,” Mr. Walz said.</p><p>A moment later a volunteer introduced himself as “part of the clown car,” prompting Mr. Walz to respond, “We all are!”</p><p>Voters appear to especially enjoy that the governor seems very food-oriented.</p><p>In Las Vegas, he dropped by Tiabi Coffee and Waffle, a coffee shop, and ordered a peanut butter banana smoothie. In Wausau, Wis., he drew laughs from a crowd when he explained that the owners of a local Ukrainian bakery had just sold him cake “that I probably don’t need but I sure wanted.” Mr. Walz and his daughter, Hope, loaded up on whoopie pies and cider doughnuts at a visit to an orchard in Pennsylvania.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Republicans have suggested that Mr. Walz’s policies are out of touch with the majority of the electorate, and he has faced early questions about how well his appeal would translate outside Minnesota.</p><p>At rallies, Mr. Trump has taken to calling him “Tampon Tim,” accusing him of signing a law to place tampons and pads in boys’ restrooms for transgender students. While the law was written by Democratic lawmakers to guarantee access to the products for “<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF2497&amp;session_year=2023&amp;session_number=0&amp;version=latest#:~:text=ACCESS%20TO%20MENSTRUAL%20PRODUCTS." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all menstruating students</a>,” schools have interpreted the law as a mandate to place tampons and pads in female and gender neutral bathrooms, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/walz-free-tampons-schools-minnesota.html?timespastHighlight=Tampon,Tim" title="">rather than ones designated only for boys</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s campaign argued that voters would not be drawn in by Mr. Walz’s banter.</p><p>“He’s unelectable to voters from the Midwest to the Sun Belt and beyond,” Rachel Reisner, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said in a statement. “American voters won’t be fooled by his jokes or silly dog and pony shows; they know the Harris-Walz agenda is dangerous and would destroy America as we know it.”</p><p>Stan Barnes, a former Republican state lawmaker and political consultant in Arizona, suggested Mr. Walz was focusing on aspects of his personality to distract from his left-leaning record.</p><p>“They are trying to convince voters that they are a likable, normal alternative,” Mr. Barnes said. But he added that Mr. Trump, if polling proved accurate, had appeared to be appealing to racial minorities in a way no other Republican in the state had done before.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Several political strategists, though, suggested Mr. Walz’s plain-spoken language and appeal to Midwestern values would most likely help him, even in diverse Sun Belt battlegrounds.</p><p>“We talk about white working-class voters and Latino working-class voters and Black working-class voters,” said Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of Nevada’s powerful Culinary Workers Union, a key ally for Democrats. “But working-class voters have a lot in common — they all want more money in their pocket.”</p><p>In Arizona, the top issues for the independent voters who could sway the election remain inflation and immigration. But Mr. Walz’s recitation of Midwestern values, such as family, honesty and hard work, have complemented his pleas to defend democracy and abortion rights and helped him draw a contrast with Mr. Trump, said Mike Noble, a pollster at Noble Predictive Insights in Phoenix.</p><p>“The more they can talk about those character issues, the more they can talk about abortion, the more they are winning,” Mr. Noble said of Democrats.</p><p>In Tempe, addressing dozens of Arizona State University students, Mr. Walz focused on issues particularly relevant to young people, including climate change and student loans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“If I were you all, how can you not constantly go around telling people to ‘fork ‘em,’” Mr. Walz said, making a knowing allusion to the pitchfork hand gesture associated with the university and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/us/at-arizona-state-trash-talk-by-the-forkful.html" title="">the pitchforks that adorn the helmets of its football team, the Sun Devils</a>.</p><p>At stops in the Midwest and the East, he continued to make explicit appeals to young people and minorities, sometimes acknowledging his perspective as the older white man in the room. Speaking to Michigan State University students in East Lansing, Mich., last week, Mr. Walz addressed Ms. Harris’s debate performance.</p><p>“Kamala Harris did her job the other night,” Mr. Walz said. “The thing I want to say to everybody in here — especially to women and people of color — the folks who are surprised she did that, shame on them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tim Walz speaking at annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, in Washington earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Allison Bailey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>And in Washington, at the annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, an L.G.B.T.Q. rights group, Mr. Walz described himself as an “old, straight white guy” who was working to guarantee that Americans could live as their “authentic selves” without interference from government.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The most emotional moment came when Mr. Walz recalled working on federal hate-crimes legislation when he was serving in Congress and meeting Judy Shepard, whose son, Matthew, a gay student at the University of Wyoming, had been beaten, tortured and left to die in 1998.</p><p>“I remember walking with a mother who lost her son and hearing the sheriff tell me the only place it wasn’t bloody was where the tears ran down Matthew’s eyes,” he said, drawing gasps from the audience. “And I watched a mother in unbelievable pain that I couldn’t even fathom — of losing a child this way — walk with her head held high to make sure that none of the rest of us ever have to get a call from someone.”</p><p>Some of the people he met along the trail said that his words had resonated with them. Alexandria Jimenez-Greenshields, a 17-year-old student at Michigan State who attended Mr. Walz’s event there, said he seemed genuinely interested in making a connection with people.</p><p>“He was speaking from passion — it didn’t feel fake,” she said.</p><p>“It felt like he was a normal average person,” she added, “just having a normal average conversation.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kellen Browning is a Times reporter covering the 2024 election, with a focus on the swing states of Nevada and Arizona.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kellen-browning">More about Kellen Browning</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jazmine Ulloa is a national politics reporter for The Times, covering the 2024 presidential campaign.
