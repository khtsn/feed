After four hours of negotiations — the most extensive in years between the two powers — participants in the meeting suggested that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">U.S. and Russia would begin to work more closely together</a>.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio described a three-step plan that both countries had agreed to. First, they would discuss ways to ease embassy restrictions. They would also work on a peace settlement for Ukraine. Finally, Rubio said, the U.S. and Russia would explore new partnerships, both in geopolitics and business.</p><p>The plans reflected a significant shift in U.S. strategy. For years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/trump-europe-ukraine.html" title="">Joe Biden and other Western leaders</a> focused on punishing Russia for starting Europe’s most destructive war in generations. Today’s striking display of bonhomie showed that Trump was eager to work with Russia to end the war — an approach that would most likely fulfill many of the demands of its president, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/middleeast/ukraine-trump-russia-war-peace-talks.html" title="">reacted angrily to the U.S.-Russia meeting</a>. He insisted that it was important that any peace negotiations did not happen “behind the backs of the key subjects.” Any decisions, he added, “cannot be imposed” on Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk with President Trump in the Oval Office last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

And she had come to believe that Jane Austen was far superior to other female writers of her time.</p><p>Then, Romney read Frances Burney and realized that she had underestimated an entire generation of women who had influenced Austen and been great in their own right. So she used her skills to find the writers and learn how they had fallen out of the canon. Romney’s book documenting her search, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/books/review/jane-austens-bookshelf-rebecca-romney.html" title="">Jane Austen’s Bookshelf</a>,” was published today.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A scene from Barrie Kosky’s “Threepenny Opera,” performed by the Berliner Ensemble.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">JR Berliner Ensemble</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-fbeec9c">The director New York has been waiting for</h2><p>When “The Threepenny Opera” returns to New York this spring, it will be the first real opportunity for New York audiences to see the work of the director Barrie Kosky.

Eventually, however, rave reviews and word-of-mouth praise helped turn the film into a pandemic streaming hit — and an online sensation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>In less than a week, the marmalade-loving bear’s third feature-length movie, “Paddington in Peru,” has amassed $100 million in theaters.
