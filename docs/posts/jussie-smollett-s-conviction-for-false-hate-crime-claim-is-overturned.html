But law-enforcement officials later determined that Mr. Smollett had orchestrated the attack himself, and charged him with a crime.</p><p>The prosecutors then agreed to drop the charges against Mr. Smollett in exchange for his agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bond and perform community service. But after an outcry the case was revived by a special prosecutor, and Mr. Smollett was convicted of felony disorderly conduct for falsely reporting to the police that he had been the victim of a bigoted attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The prosecution’s key witnesses were two brothers, Abimbola Osundairo and Olabinjo Osundairo, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/arts/television/jussie-smollett-attacker-testimony.html" title="">testified during the trial last year</a> that Mr. Smollett had asked them to carry out the attack and instructed them in detail on how to do it.</p><p>Mr. Smollett was sentenced to five months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/arts/television/jussie-smollett-sentencing.html" title="">in jail in 2022</a> but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/arts/television/jussie-smollett-released.html?searchResultPosition=8&amp;utm_source=pocket_saves" title="">only served six days</a> of the term before he was released on appeal.</p><p>In a decision that reversed an earlier appellate court’s ruling, the Supreme Court sided with Mr. Smollett, finding that the second prosecution violated his rights.</p><p>“We hold that a second prosecution under these circumstances is a due process violation, and we therefore reverse defendant’s conviction,” Justice Elizabeth M. Rochford wrote in the opinion.</p><p>The decision was a stunning reversal in a case that has seen more than five years of twists and turns, rousing partisan-fueled outrage at times. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In a statement on Friday, Nenye Uche, a lawyer for Mr. Smollett who led his defense at trial, said: “We are thankful to the Illinois Supreme Court for restoring order to Illinois’ criminal law jurisprudence.”</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
