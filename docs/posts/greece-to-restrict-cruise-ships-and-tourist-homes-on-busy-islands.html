But a seemingly endless influx in recent years has caused headaches at some of its most popular destinations.</p><p>So this weekend, its prime minister proposed an array of measures aimed at curbing some effects of the growing crowds.</p><p>The changes include hefty increases to docking fees for cruise ships at some of Greece’s most popular islands, and limits to daily cruise ship arrivals. The rules aim to reduce the strain that the vacation industry places on communities and echo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/travel/europe-tourism-backlash.html" title="">a pushback against overtourism</a> in several other major European destinations.</p><p>“Tourism supports the economy with significant resources and jobs, but it has its own particular social impact,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during his annual state of the economy speech in Thessaloniki on Saturday night. He added that he was “very concerned about the image on some of our islands some months of the year due to cruise ships.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>More details will be announced next week, he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A cruise ship arriving in Santorini, where docking fees are to be raised.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aris Oikonomou/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Discontent over tourism has flared across Europe since pandemic-related travel restrictions receded. In April, Venice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/world/europe/venice-entry-fee.html" title="">introduced an entry fee of 5 euros</a>, about $5.50, on certain days. In July, protesters in Barcelona marched in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/travel/overtourism-barcelona.html" title="">exasperation with tourist numbers</a>.</p><p>And after those cities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/world/europe/italy-venice-tourism-cruise-ships.html" title="">diverted cruises</a> from busy ports, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/world/europe/amsterdam-cruise-ships.html" title="">officials in Amsterdam</a> decided to cut cruise traffic in half by 2026, before eventually <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2024/07/03/amsterdam-cruise-ships-cap-crowds/74294779007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closing its terminal</a>, citing worries about overcrowding and pollution.</p><p>The issue carries particularly high stakes in Greece, where tourism accounts for about a fifth of economic output.

Some of the additional revenue will go toward local infrastructure, he said.</p><p>The government will also increase a lodging tax paid by hotels and rental accommodations on the islands, with those proceeds going toward local communities to help them during the peak season, Mr. Mitsotakis said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>And property owners who offer long-term leases, rather than the short-term rentals generally given to international visitors, will be exempt from paying rental tax for three years, he said.</p><p>Mr. Mitsotakis also heralded restrictions, to be announced in coming weeks, on runaway construction on the most overdeveloped islands, apparently targeting vacation homes. “Let’s take action and put the brakes, wherever needed, on islands where we believe that the situation has reached a point that the infrastructure is essentially being tested,” he told reporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="greece-tourism-map-k90m" data-id="100000009678858" data-source-id="100000009678858"><div data-sourceid="100000009678858" id="embed-id-100000009678858">
