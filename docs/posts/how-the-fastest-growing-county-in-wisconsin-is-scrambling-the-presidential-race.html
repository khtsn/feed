The dark-blue liberal politics of Dane County. </p><p>“We’re very extreme Democrats,” said Ms. Allcock, 43, a marketing executive who said she “absolutely” planned to cast a ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>Voters like Ms. Allcock could decide the presidential election in Wisconsin, which flips back and forth between Republicans and Democrats in statewide contests by the slimmest of margins. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dane County, where Ms. Harris is holding a rally on Friday night, is home to the state government, the sprawling flagship University of Wisconsin campus and, particularly in the last decade, a flourishing health care and technology industry.</p><p><a href="https://www.capitalarearpc.org/the-wisconsin-doa-releases-preliminary-population-estimates/#:~:text=Once%20again%2C%20Dane%20County%20topped,the%20state&#39;s%20most%20populous%20county." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">It is also the fastest-growing county</a> in the state, changing what it takes for presidential candidates to win a statewide race in Wisconsin. In recent years, Dane County has seen a rapid population rise in both the city of Madison and the suburbs that are suddenly blossoming around it, fueled by growth at the university and the local economy. </p><p>The people who are moving to Dane County tend to vote for Democrats, opening an opportunity for a party desperate to win a state that narrowly picked President Biden in 2020 and narrowly picked Donald J. Trump in 2016. Turnout in this region has been sky-high in recent presidential elections, a reflection of the Democratic Party’s ground game in Dane County. In 2020, 89 percent of registered voters in the county <a href="https://elections.countyofdane.com/Election-Result/124#race0002" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cast ballots</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emily Kuhn, the mayor of Middleton, Wis.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Political signs outside a home in Middleton.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The shifts have not gone unnoticed, and with just over six weeks until the election, Democrats plan to open a 15th campaign office in Dane County on Friday, more than in any other county in the state.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last week, residents of Middleton, a suburb of Madison, gathered with popcorn in a campaign office to watch Ms. Harris debate Mr. Trump. </p><p>Among them was Emily Kuhn, Middleton’s mayor.
