name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Han Kang, the South Korean author best known for her surreal, subversive novel, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/the-vegetarian-by-han-kang.html" title="">The Vegetarian</a>,” was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday — the first writer from her country to receive the major award.</p><p>Mats Malm, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which organizes the prize, said at a news conference in Stockholm that Han was receiving the honor “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.”</p><p>“The Vegetarian,” published in Korea in 2007, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/books/han-kang-wins-man-booker-international-prize-for-fiction-with-the-vegetarian.html" title="">won the 2016 International Booker Prize</a> after it was translated into English. It centers on a depressed housewife who shocks her family when she stops eating meat; later, she stops eating altogether and yearns to turn into a tree that can live off sunlight alone. Porochista Khakpour, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/the-vegetarian-by-han-kang.html" title="">review of “The Vegetarian” for The New York Times</a>, said that Han “has been rightfully celebrated as a visionary in South Korea.”</p><p>Han’s Nobel was a surprise. Before the announcement, the bookmakers’ favorite for this year’s award was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/29/books/a-nightmare-circling-overhead.html" title="">Can Xue</a>, an avant-garde Chinese writer of category-defying novels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Anders Olsson, the chair of the Nobel committee, said in a statement on Thursday that Han, in her writing, “has a unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and the dead, and in her poetic and experimental style has become an innovator in contemporary prose.”</p><p>Han, 53, was born in 1970 in Gwangju, South Korea. Her father was also a novelist, but much less successful. The family struggled financially and moved frequently. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/books/the-vegetarian-a-surreal-south-korean-novel.html" title="">a 2016 interview with The Times</a>, Han said her transitory upbringing “was too much for a little child, but I was all right because I was surrounded by books.”</p><p>When Han was 9, her family moved to Seoul just months before the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/world/asia/south-korea-photos-gwangju-crackdown.html" title="">Gwangju uprising</a>, when government troops fired on crowds of pro-democracy protesters, killing hundreds. The event shaped her views on humanity’s capacity for violence, Han said in the 2016 interview, and its specter has haunted her writing. In her 2014 novel “Human Acts,” for instance, a writer observes a police raid on a group of activists.</p><p>She studied literature at Yonsei University in Korea, and her first published works were poems. Her debut novel, “Black Deer,” which came out in 1998, was a mystery about a missing woman. In the 2016 interview, Han said it was around that time that she developed the idea for a short story about a woman who becomes a plant, which she eventually developed into “The Vegetarian.”</p><p>Although relatively young for a Nobel laureate, Han is far older than Rudyard Kipling was when he accepted the 1907 award, at age 41.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>She is the author of eight novels, as well as several novellas and collections of essays and short stories. Among her other novels are “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/books/review/han-kang-white-book.html" title="">The White Book</a>,” which was also nominated for the International Booker Prize, and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/books/review/greek-lessons-han-kang.html" title="">Greek Lessons</a>,” published in English in 2023.</p><p>In “Greek Lessons,” a woman loses her ability to speak and tries to restore it by learning ancient Greek. Idra Novey, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/books/review/greek-lessons-han-kang.html" title="">a review for The Times</a>, called the novel “a celebration of the ineffable trust to be found in sharing language.”</p><p>Ankhi Mukherjee, a literature professor at the University of Oxford, said in a telephone interview that she had taught Han’s work “year in, year out” for almost two decades. “Her writing is relentlessly political — whether it’s the politics of the body, of gender, of people fighting against the state — but it never lets go of the literary imagination,” Mukherjee said, adding: “It’s never sanctimonious; it’s very playful, funny and surreal.”</p><p>The Nobel Prize is literature’s pre-eminent award, and winning it is a capstone to a writer, poet or playwright’s career. Past recipients have included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/books/toni-morrison-dead.html" title="">Toni Morrison</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/theater/26pinter.html" title="">Harold Pinter</a> and, in 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/arts/music/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-literature.html#:~:text=Dylan%20was%20an%20appropriate%20choice,win%20the%20prize%20since%20Ms." title="">Bob Dylan</a>. Along with the prestige and a huge boost in sales, the new laureate receives 11 million Swedish krona, about $1 million.</p><p>In recent years, the academy has tried to increase the diversity of authors considered for the literature prize, after facing criticism over the low number of laureates who were female or came from outside Europe and North America.</p><p>Since 2020, the academy has awarded the prize to one person of color — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/books/abdulrazak-gurnah-nobel-book.html" title="">Abdulrazak Gurnah</a>, a Tanzanian writer whose novels dissect the legacy of colonialism — as well as two women: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/books/louise-gluck-dead.html" title="">Louise Glück</a>, the American poet, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/books/annie-ernaux-nobel-prize-literature.html" title="">Annie Ernaux, the French writer</a> of autobiographical works.</p><p>Last year’s recipient was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/07/arts/jon-fosse-nobel-prize.html" title="">Jon Fosse, a Norwegian author and playwright</a> whose novels, told in lengthy sentences, often contain religious undertones.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Marshall is a Times reporter covering European culture.
