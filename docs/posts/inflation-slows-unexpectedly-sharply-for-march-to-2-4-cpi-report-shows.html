Over the course of the month, prices fell 0.1 percent.</p><p>A gauge tracking underlying inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy items, slipped to 2.8 percent in March, following a 0.1 percent monthly increase. Overall, that is the slowest annual pace for “core” inflation since 2021.</p><p>The report, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday, significantly undershot economists’ expectations, prompting Mr. Trump and his advisers to seize on the data as a sign that the president’s policies were working.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It “wasn’t just good, it was really great,” Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said of the inflation report. But economists warn that the positive news is unlikely to last with costly tariffs now in effect against China and other trading partners.</p><p>“We don’t see tariffs as a one-time price shock. We see them as having significant second round effects,” said James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We expect that tariffs will first impact goods prices and then ultimately move through wages as the labor market remains fairly tight. That feeds back and affects other goods prices and services as well and creates a cycle in inflation.&#34;</p><p>In recent days, the president’s tariff plans have changed drastically, culminating in the administration on Wednesday announcing a 90-day pause on punishing levies that were put in place on April 2. Mr. Trump’s decision to pause came as global financial markets wobbled and started to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/bonds-tariffs-safe-haven.html" title="">flash warning signs</a> about investors’ appetite for U.S. assets. Goods coming into the country from most other countries will now face a 10 percent tariff, while Chinese imports will have a 125 percent charge, after Beijing’s decision to retaliate against U.S. products.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s pivot significantly eased worries about the extent of the economic damage stemming from his administration’s trade policies. But the levies are significant enough to have a notable impact on growth and inflation, economists say.</p><p>Consumers are at risk of bearing the brunt of the costs from tariffs, which are a tax on imports. Businesses are widely expected to try to pass along their higher expenses in the from of price increases or risk their profit margins getting squeezed significantly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, said he expected most of the third-party sellers on the giant e-commerce platform to do so. “I understand why, I mean, depending on which country you’re in, you don’t have 50 percent extra margin that you can play with,” he said. “I think they’ll try and pass the cost on.”</p><p>Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup, said this dynamic could start to show up in the data in the coming months as businesses adjust.</p><p>“These tariffs are so large, so broad and so well-telegraphed that that might give retailers more confidence that everyone’s going to be raising their prices,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/10DC-INFLATION-bpzl/10DC-INFLATION-bpzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/10DC-INFLATION-bpzl/10DC-INFLATION-bpzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/10/multimedia/10DC-INFLATION-bpzl/10DC-INFLATION-bpzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People walk by shops and food kiosks in a wide open, large mall with a white marble floor.

That could weigh further on growth and even risk the economy tipping into a recession if businesses eventually are forced to fire workers as demand falls.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>March’s softer inflation data stemmed from a sharp drop in energy prices as well as a decline in transportation-related categories like airfares, auto insurance and used cars. Grocery prices rose 0.5 percent for the month, and for the year they are up 2.4 percent compared with the same time last year. A nearly 6 percent monthly rise in egg prices was the biggest contributor to that increase.</p><p>Goods prices dropped 0.4 percent in March, while services inflation once energy prices were stripped out rose only 0.1 percent.</p><p>The report offered a “heartening albeit backward-looking picture of inflation dynamics,” said Lydia Boussour, an economist at EY-Parthenon. With the tariffs Mr. Trump has so far announced, her team expects consumer price inflation to be 0.8 percentage points higher this year.</p><p>The big question for the Federal Reserve is how to balance the risks that inflation could rise again as growth slows and ultimately what that means for interest rates. Even before Mr. Trump’s tariffs, inflation was proving stubbornly sticky, with progress toward the central bank’s 2 percent goal stalling in recent months. That had made the Fed more hesitant to continue cutting interest rates after a series of reductions last year — a caution that has been amplified with the implementation of higher tariffs.</p><p>With inflation poised to re-accelerate again, even if it ends up being temporary, the Fed has made clear that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/federal-reserve-trump-tariffs-inflation.html" title="">bar for further rate cuts is high</a>. That means it will take tangible evidence that the economy is weakening in a material way for the Fed to take any action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Perhaps the biggest concern for the central bank is a situation in which expectations about future inflation start to shift in a way that suggests Americans are becoming worried about price pressures staying persistently high. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said in a recent speech that it was the institution’s “obligation” to keep inflation expectations in check and to “make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”</p><p>Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Kansas City Fed and a voting member on this year’s policy-setting committee, echoed that view in a speech on Thursday.</p><p>“Now, with renewed price pressures likely, I am not willing to take any chances when it comes to maintaining the Fed’s credibility on inflation,” he said. In a moderated discussion after his remarks, he said the Fed still had work to do to get inflation back to the central bank’s 2 percent target.</p><p>So far, only a handful of survey-based measures of inflation expectations have shifted in a notable way, including one run by the University of Michigan. Market-based measures have budged far less. Still, Ricardo Reis, an economist at the London School of Economics, said the “size and visibility” of the inflation shock was a concern, as were the “mixed signals” coming from the expectations data.</p><p>“The Fed has an inflation target to meet, and the effect on inflation of the tariffs is quite direct and likely quick,” he said. “It should talk tough.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In a speech on Thursday, Lorie Logan, president of the Dallas Fed, sought to do just that as she talked about the Fed’s congressional-mandated duty to both achieve stable inflation as well as a healthy labor market.</p><p>“History teaches that when higher inflation expectations become entrenched, the road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker and the economic scars are deeper,” she said. “To sustainably achieve both of our dual-mandate goals, it will be important to keep any tariff-related price increases from fostering more persistent inflation.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for The Times.</p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/10/business/inflation-cpi-tariffs-march.html">133</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/10/business/inflation-cpi-tariffs-march.html">133</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
