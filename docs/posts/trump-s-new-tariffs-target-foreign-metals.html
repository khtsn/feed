    <h1>Trump’s New Tariffs Target Foreign Metals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump imposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html" title="">sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum</a> today, reprising a policy from his first term. All imports of the metals, no matter the country of origin, would face a 25 percent tax, according to the White House.</p><p>Domestic steel makers say they are struggling to compete against cheap foreign steel. They benefited last time Trump imposed similar tariffs, Ana Swanson, our international trade reporter, told me.</p><p>“But there’s a big trade-off,” Ana said. “They increase costs for other businesses that use steel and aluminum. And there are a lot of those — makers of cars, machinery, planes and food packaging come to mind.”</p><p>The new fees are likely to rankle allies like Canada and Mexico, who supply the bulk of U.S. metal imports. They would also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/china-trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html" title="">hit at China</a>, which dominates the global steel and aluminum industry, even if it does not export a lot of steel or aluminum directly to the U.S.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In his three weeks back in office, Ana pointed out, Trump has already threatened more tariffs globally than he did in his entire first term, when he ended up imposing levies on foreign solar panels, washing machines, metals and more than $300 billion of products from China.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7f0127cf">A judge said the White House had defied his court order</h2><p>A federal judge in Rhode Island said today that the Trump administration had failed to comply with his order to release billions of dollars in federal grants. The ruling was the first time a judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/trump-unfreezing-federal-grants-judge-ruling.html" title="">expressly declared that Trump or his aides were disobeying a judicial mandate</a>.</p><p>The judge, John McConnell, an Obama appointee, did not specify any penalties for failing to comply. But his ruling marked a step toward what could become a high-stakes showdown between the executive and judicial branches. Just yesterday, Vice President JD Vance claimed that “judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstration in Tel Aviv on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alexi J.

Hamas blamed the delay on Israel’s government, which it accused of violating the cease-fire deal.</p><p>Both sides have previously accused each other of violating the fragile truce, but until now hostage-for-prisoner exchanges have proceeded each week. Today’s change also threatens the prospects for agreement on a lasting end to the war. Talks on that subject were supposed to begin last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk at the Capitol last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-5fb48e43">Musk led a bid to buy OpenAI</h2><p>A group of investors led by Elon Musk has made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/technology/elon-musk-openai-bid.html" title="">a $97.4 billion bid to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI</a>, the artificial intelligence company that created ChatGPT.</p><p>OpenAI declined to comment, but Sam Altman, the company’s chief executive, posted a response on social media: “No thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Musk, who has had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/technology/sam-altman-elon-musk-trump.html" title="">yearslong rivalry with Altman</a>, replied to the post: “Swindler,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Outside the Superdome in New Orleans, last night. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christiana Botic for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eddie Murphy as Gumby in “Saturday Night Live” in 1984.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">RM Lewis Jr./NBC Universal, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-256b2afa">When was peak S.N.L.?</h2><p>At the end of this week, “Saturday Night Live” is celebrating its past with a 50th anniversary special.
