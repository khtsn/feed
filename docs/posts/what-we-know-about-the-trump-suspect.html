    <h1>What We Know About the Trump Suspect</h1>

The first carries a 15-year prison sentence. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/16/us/trump-shooting-news" title="">Here are live updates</a>.</p><p>Cellphone data indicated that Ryan Routh, 58, was in the woods near Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., for roughly 12 hours before a Secret Service agent spotted what appeared to be the barrel of a rifle and opened fire. The suspect fled the scene, leaving behind a semiautomatic rifle, and was arrested later. </p><p>Routh never had Trump in his sightline, and did not fire his weapon, said Ronald Rowe, the acting Secret Service director. </p><p>He was previously arrested in 2002 in Greensboro, N.C., after he barricaded himself inside a building with a fully automatic weapon. Records show that he was convicted of “possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction,” a felony. In 2019, he was investigated by the F.B.I. based on a tip that he was in possession of a firearm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Floodwaters in the Romanian village of Slobozia Conachi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Mihailescu/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-f6d41ee">Deadly floods hit Central Europe </h2><p>At least 17 people were dead and several others missing after days of flooding in Central Europe.

Two judges also pressed the government on how a ban might infringe on the First Amendment. The lawyers have asked the judges to deliver a decision in the case before Dec. 6.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Titan submersible in an undated photo at the beginning of a dive.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Imago/OceanGate Expeditions, via Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-5b51ffbf">The Titan was riddled with problems, investigators said </h2><p>The Coast Guard began its first public hearing on the Titan submersible disaster that killed five people in 2023.

But executives at FX, a network known for critics’ darlings, convinced him. The show took about a decade to come together, and last night at the Emmy Awards, that enormous patience paid off.</p><p>Disney won 60 Emmys, and FX was responsible for 36. Of those, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/business/media/fx-emmy-wins.html" title="">18 went to “Shogun,”</a> including the network’s first win for best drama. FX’s show “The Bear” also dominated the comedy awards with 23 nominations and 11 wins. My colleagues in Culture say “Shogun” is very much worth your time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/arts/television/shogun-fx-streaming-guide.html" title="">and here’s why</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-1eda536">The Booker Prize shortlist makes history </h2><p>For the first time since the Booker Prize was first awarded in 1969, five of the six nominated titles are by female authors. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/books/booker-prize-2024-shortlist.html" title="">The nominees are</a>: “Orbital,” by Samantha Harvey; “Creation Lake,” by Rachel Kushner; “Held,” by Anne Michaels; “James,” by Percival Everett; “The Safekeep,” by Yael van der Wouden; and “Stone Yard Devotional,” by Charlotte Wood.</p><p>The judges will reread the shortlisted novels before choosing a winner, to be announced at a ceremony in London on Nov. 12.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Testani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>CosMc’s, a beverage chain from McDonald’s, offers made-to-order drinks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo Illustration by Jonathan Zizzo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><h2 id="link-1d4b6ff6">Customized drinks are off the rails </h2><p>Could that S’mores Cold Brew benefit from a splash of Coca-Cola?

There are also smaller but growing chains like Swig, a modern answer to the soda fountains of the 1950s. As a plus, some of these shops are hangout spots for people who don’t drink coffee or alcohol.</p><p>Have a bubbly evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading. — Justin</em></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/evening-briefing" title=""><em>Sign up here to get this newsletter in your inbox.</em></a></p><p><em>Reach our team at </em><a href="mailto:evening@nytimes.com" title=""><em>evening@nytimes.com.</em></a><em> And follow The New York Times on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimes/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.threads.net/@nytimes?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Threads</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytimes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytimes?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> at @nytimes.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Justin Porter is Times editor working on the Newsletters desk.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div>
