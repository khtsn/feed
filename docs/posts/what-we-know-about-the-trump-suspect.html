The first carries a 15-year prison sentence. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/16/us/trump-shooting-news" title="">Here are live updates</a>.</p><p>Cellphone data indicated that Ryan Routh, 58, was in the woods near Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., for roughly 12 hours before a Secret Service agent spotted what appeared to be the barrel of a rifle and opened fire. The suspect fled the scene, leaving behind a semiautomatic rifle, and was arrested later. </p><p>Routh never had Trump in his sightline, and did not fire his weapon, said Ronald Rowe, the acting Secret Service director. </p><p>He was previously arrested in 2002 in Greensboro, N.C., after he barricaded himself inside a building with a fully automatic weapon. Records show that he was convicted of “possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction,” a felony. In 2019, he was investigated by the F.B.I. based on a tip that he was in possession of a firearm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Thomas Gibbons-Neff, The Times’s Ukraine correspondent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-routh-ukraine-interview.html" title="">interviewed Routh</a> for a 2023 article about American volunteers fighting in Ukraine.
