    <h1>Europe Relaxes Rules on Company Climate Reports</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“The world is changing in front of our eyes,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner for the economy, citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/middleeast/us-un-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">U.S. opposition to a United Nations resolution</a> condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine.</p><p>Building a more competitive economy and cutting red tape are important parts of navigating this “complex” environment, he said. “We cannot hope or expect to successfully compete in a perilous world with one hand tied behind our backs,” he added.</p><p>On the reporting rules, known as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the commission has also proposed a two-year delay for companies that would have been required to report this year and next. The commission said these changes, and related measures, would save companies about €6 billion per year in administrative work.</p><p>The changes need to be approved by the European Parliament before taking effect.</p><p>The European Union has been at the vanguard of designing and putting in place rules on climate change and corporate sustainability, but on Wednesday commissioners said those efforts had gone too far.</p><p>The “intensive” period of regulatory activity in the past five years, Mr. Dombrovskis said, “has come as a cost, generating a large regulatory burden on people and businesses.”</p></div></div>
