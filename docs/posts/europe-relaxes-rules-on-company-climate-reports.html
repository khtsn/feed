European officials have become increasingly concerned about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/europe-economy-competitiveness.html" title="">waning economic competitiveness</a>, particularly when compared with the United States and China. These worries have been exacerbated since President Trump’s return to the White House.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s push to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/business/trump-deregulation-firing.html" title="">relax the rules on companies</a> has widened the regulatory gap with Europe. E.U. commissioners also said changes were needed to strengthen the region’s economy, which has been sluggish.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The world is changing in front of our eyes,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner for the economy, citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/middleeast/us-un-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">U.S. opposition to a United Nations resolution</a> condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine.</p><p>Building a more competitive economy and cutting red tape are important parts of navigating this “complex” environment, he said. “We cannot hope or expect to successfully compete in a perilous world with one hand tied behind our backs,” he added.</p><p>On the reporting rules, known as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the commission has also proposed a two-year delay for companies that would have been required to report this year and next. The commission said these changes, and related measures, would save companies about €6 billion per year in administrative work.</p><p>The changes need to be approved by the European Parliament before taking effect.</p><p>The European Union has been at the vanguard of designing and putting in place rules on climate change and corporate sustainability, but on Wednesday commissioners said those efforts had gone too far.</p><p>The “intensive” period of regulatory activity in the past five years, Mr. Dombrovskis said, “has come at a cost, generating a large regulatory burden on people and businesses.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>President Emmanuel Macron of France has been a key supporter of loosening the rules on companies, arguing last month that Europe needed to take a “massive regulatory break.”</p><p>In a news conference in Brussels, officials were at pains to say that “simplification” was not the same as deregulation and was not a sign of giving up on the commission’s green agenda. Maria Luís Albuquerque, the commissioner for financial services, said she expected that many companies would voluntarily follow the sustainability reporting rules because they had already made their own commitments or would report under simpler guidelines as members of the supply chains of larger companies.</p><p>The proposals are intended to “alleviate the burdens and the costs of reporting, but maintaining preserving the anchor in our Green Deal objectives,” Ms. Albuquerque said.</p><p>The commission on Wednesday also announced a series of measures it called the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/clean-industrial-deal_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clean Industrial Deal</a>, aimed at decarbonizing Europe’s economy. On the same day, the European energy giant BP said it would increase spending on oil and gas while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/business/bp-oil-gas-renewables-strategy.html" title="">sharply reducing investments in clean energy</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eshe-nelson">More about Eshe Nelson</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How Altman Won Over Trump: </strong>After helping President Trump get elected, Elon Musk was poised to dominate America’s A.I. policies.
