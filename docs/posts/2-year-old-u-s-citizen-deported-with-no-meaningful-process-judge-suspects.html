    <h1>2-Year-Old U.S. Citizen Deported ‘With No Meaningful Process,’ Judge Suspects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The case of V.M.L., which was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/25/us-citizen-deportation-donald-trump-00311631" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by Politico</a>, is the latest challenge to the legality of several aspects of President Trump’s aggressive deportation efforts.</p><p>The administration has already been blocked by seven federal judges in courts across the country from removing Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to El Salvador under a rarely invoked wartime statute. It has also created an uproar by wrongfully deporting a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to El Salvador and so far refusing to work to bring him back.</p><p>According to court papers, the 2-year-old girl had accompanied her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, and her older sister, Valeria, to an immigration appointment in New Orleans on Tuesday when they were taken into custody by officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>Ms. Lopez Villela was scheduled for an expedited removal from the country on Friday. And in a filing to Judge Doughty, lawyers for the Justice Department claimed that she “made known to ICE officials that she wanted to retain custody of V.M.L. and for V.M.L. to go” with her to Honduras.</p><p>But in a petition filed by the child’s custodian, Trish Mack, on Thursday, her father claimed that when he spoke briefly with Ms. Lopez Villela, he could hear her and the children crying. The father reminded her, the petition said, that “their daughter was a U.S. citizen and could not be deported.”</p></div></div>
