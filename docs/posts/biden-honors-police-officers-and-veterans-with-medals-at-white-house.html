The president said it was being given in recognition of the officers’ acts of selflessness in attempting to save or protect human life.</p><p>“They saved children — they saved people in serious distress,” Mr. Biden told reporters after the Oval Office ceremony, which was closed to the public. “They literally put their lives at risk — some of them at the point that you wonder how they could have had the nerve to do it.”</p><p>Later on Friday, Mr. Biden read the names of seven people receiving the Medal of Honor, the military’s highest award, and solemnly observed that he was making the announcement for a final time as commander in chief.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“These are genuine to-their-core heroes — heroes of different ranks, different positions, and even different generations, but heroes who all went above and beyond the call of duty,” he said.</p><p>Six of the men were honored posthumously, with their relatives accepting the medals on their behalf. They included five Korean War veterans — Pvt. Bruno R. Orig, Pfc. Wataru Nakamura, Cpl. Fred B. McGee, Pfc. Charles R. Johnson and Richard E. Cavazos, then a first lieutenant — and one Vietnam War veteran, Capt. Hugh R. Nelson Jr.</p><p>The crowd stood and applauded when Specialist Fourth Class Kenneth J. David, the sole living honoree, received his medal from Mr. Biden.</p><p>The police officers honored with the Medal of Valor on Friday were part of a group that raced to the Covenant School, a private Christian school in Nashville, in March 2023 in the minutes after the first 911 calls from the school. Three 9-year-old students, as well as three staff members, were killed in the gunfire.</p><p>Law enforcement officials, families and staff members at the school have praised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nashville-school-shooting.html" title="">the response by the police department</a> for stopping further carnage. Body camera footage showed the officers quickly running into the school and confronting the assailant, killing the shooter about 14 minutes after the first call.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some of the officers were assigned to a station near the school, while others happened to be in the area and responded to the calls.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in the days after the shooting, Sgt. Jeff Mathes, one of the officers, said it was “our job is to run towards it,” a sentiment that the White House highlighted in its announcement of the honorees.</p><p>“All of us stepped over a victim,” he said, recounting what happened. “To this day, I don’t know how I did that morally, but training is what kicked in.”</p><p>The Medal of Valor is one of several national, state and local accolades that have been given to the group. Families of the surviving students have also credited the men with ensuring that their children survived.</p><p>“They deserve the world,” said Sarah Shoop Neumann, a parent of a Covenant student who became an outspoken gun control advocate in the aftermath of the shooting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Bestowing the award has been a point of personal pride for Mr. Biden, who as a senator cosponsored the legislation that established the medal in 2001. He often handed out the award while serving as vice president under President Barack Obama.</p><p>Mr. Biden presented two more Medals of Valor on Friday, to Brendan Gaffney and Lt. John Vanderstar of the New York Fire Department, who saved children from burning buildings in separate incidents. The final medal was presented to Sgt. Tu Tran, a police officer in Lincoln, Neb., who pulled a drowning woman from a water-filled car in February.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane">More about Emily Cochrane</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
