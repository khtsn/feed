From the early 1800s to the late 1960s, the U.S. government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/30/us/native-american-boarding-schools.html" title="">removed Native children from their families and homes and sent them to boarding schools</a> for the purpose of erasing their tribal ties and cultural practices.</p><p>“For decades, this terrible chapter was hidden from our history books,” said Deb Haaland, the nation’s first Native American Secretary of Interior, who joined the president on Air Force One to Arizona. “But now our administration’s work will ensure no one will ever forget.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo citizen, was emotional as she recounted how members of her own family were sent to federally run Indian boarding schools. At one time, she said, the idea that the government would apologize to survivors and descendants was “far-fetched.”</p><p>Mr. Biden is expected to speak about legislation he has signed that has delivered more than $45 billion in federal money toward tribal nations and particularly infrastructure and health systems on reservations. The Gila River Indian Community outside of Phoenix has received more than $80 million in federal funds to build a pipeline to irrigate crops amid drought conditions.</p><p>With just weeks left before the presidential election, Democrats have been making an effort to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/politics/ruben-gallego-grand-canyon.html" title="">woo Native American voters</a>. Arizona is one of seven key battleground states that could put Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald J. Trump over the threshold of 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.</p><p>Native Americans make up over 6 percent of the state’s population, but about a quarter of the state is designated as tribal land.</p><p>At least 19,000 Native children were sent to schools, and nearly 1,000 died while attending them, according to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/native-american-boarding-schools.html" title="">investigative report</a> the Interior Department released in July as part of a search for the possible remains of Native American children at schools nationwide.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The department conducted interviews with hundreds of survivors who described widespread sexual and physical abuse at the schools. Others described lasting feelings of abandonment and shame from having their family connections severed when they were taken away to attend the schools.</p><p>The report from July called on the federal government to apologize and take steps that include creating a national memorial to commemorate the children’s deaths and educate the public; investing in research and helping Native communities heal from intergenerational stress and trauma; and revitalizing Native languages.</p><p>While other nations, like Canada, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/world/canada/mass-graves-residential-schools.html" title="">continued to grapple</a> with their treatment of Indigenous people, they have been years ahead of the United States in acknowledging the government’s role. <a href="https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1571589171655" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In 2008</a>, Canada’s prime minister first apologized for the country’s residential schools, admitting that they were part of a policy to forcibly assimilate. Critics say the United States still has considerable work to do to repair the generations of damage caused by its own boarding schools for Native children.</p><p>“This long awaited apology is another step in the right direction, but the United States must now fulfill its affirmative obligations to take real action and give effect to this apology,” said Beth Wright, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund who worked on boarding school cases. </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
