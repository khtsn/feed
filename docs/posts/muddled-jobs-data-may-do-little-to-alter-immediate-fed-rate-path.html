    <h1>Muddled Jobs Data May Do Little to Alter Immediate Fed Rate Path</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“They are going to need more data after this,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives. She added that the Fed was unlikely to make big shifts at its meeting next week in any case, given how much could change in the economy depending on who wins the White House.</p><p>“The Fed is going to be heads down here. We’re at a moment of intense uncertainty because of the U.S. election,” she said.</p><p>The Fed has two goals. Central bankers are supposed to control inflation and maintain a strong labor market. That means that when inflation is rapid, as it was from 2021 to 2023, officials lift interest rates to slow the economy and wrestle it down. And when inflation cools, as it has been doing recently, policymakers lower interest rates to make sure that they do not cool growth so much that they risk serious damage to hiring conditions.</p><p>Because price increases have slowed and unemployment has ticked up over the past year, the Fed lowered interest rates by half a percentage point in September. Officials are widely expected to follow that up with another rate cut at their meeting on Nov. 7.</p><p>What happens after that is less certain.</p><p>Fed officials have forecast two more quarter-point rate cuts before the end of the year, which would most likely mean one in November and one in December. They have also forecast further rate cuts in 2025. But U.S. growth has been strong in recent months, and consumers are spending at a robust clip. Such resilience could make it tough to decide how much and how quickly to lower interest rates.</p></div></div>
