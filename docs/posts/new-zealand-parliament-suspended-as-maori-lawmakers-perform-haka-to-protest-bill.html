Ms. Maipi-Clarke, who performed the haka in Parliament after she was elected last year, was <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/combined/HansD_20241114_20241114" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended</a> over the protest, which Mr. Brownlee described as disrespectful.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Treaty of Waitangi, signed by Māori chiefs and the British Crown in 1840, is considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/16/world/australia/new-zealand-maori-rights.html" title="">New Zealand’s founding document</a>. It forms the basis of the laws and policies aimed at redressing historical wrongs against the Māori by colonizers.</p><p>But a political party known as Act, the most right-wing member in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/world/asia/new-zealand-election-national-wins.html" title="">conservative coalition government</a>, says it wants “equal rights” for all, and that special provisions for people based on their ethnic origin have been divisive for New Zealand society.</p><p>This month, <a href="https://bills.parliament.nz/v/6/227e6d0b-e632-42eb-cffe-08dcfeb826c6?Tab=history" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Act introduced the bill</a>, which experts say could severely damage race relations and undo decades of work aimed at redressing historical wrongs against the Māori people by colonizers. It has already stoked racial tensions in the country.</p><p>Māori make up roughly 20 percent of New Zealand’s 5.3 million people. They experience material hardship, have worse health indicators and are incarcerated at much higher rates than the population at large.</p><p>Thousands of people protested the bill by marching across the nation to Wellington, the capital, this week, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/533680/hikoi-protest-thousands-march-through-key-auckland-sites-on-day-three" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to local media</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The National Party, the main center-right political party in New Zealand and the senior member of the governing coalition, has tried to distance itself from the bill. But party leaders had agreed to introduce the bill when they formed the alliance with Act.</p><p>Lawmakers voted to advance the bill on Thursday, but the legislation is unlikely to progress further or become law.</p><p>“You do not go and negate, with a single stroke of a pen, 184 years of debate and discussion with a bill that I think is very simplistic,” Prime Minister Christopher Luxon <a href="https://youtu.be/uoHDAtrGXl8?t=159" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters on Thursday</a> ahead of the first reading.</p><p>Mr. Luxon, who belongs to the National Party, said he wanted the bill to be voted down in the second reading.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
