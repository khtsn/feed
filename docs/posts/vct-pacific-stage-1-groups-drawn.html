		<p>Following the conclusion of the five-map <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> lower final, the groups for Stage 1 of league play in VCT Pacific were <a href="https://x.com/vctpacific/status/1888220011480981856" target="_blank">drawn</a>.</p>

<p>Teams were seeded into five pools based on their placement at Kickoff.</p>

<p>Group Alpha:</p>



<p>Group Omega:</p>



<p>Matches will be played in a round-robin fashion within groups, and the top four teams from each group will qualify for the Stage 1 playoffs. The top three teams from playoffs will qualify for Masters Toronto. Groups will be re-drawn before Stage 2.</p>

<p>In 2024, VCT regions had just 11 teams, resulting in groups having six and five teams respectively. With the number of teams increasing to 12 in 2025, groups now have six teams each. Nongshim RedForce and BOOM Esports, who gained entry into VCT following <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2146/champions-tour-2024-pacific-ascension" target="_blank">Pacific Ascension</a>, will be looking to build toward qualification for Champions 2025 as they look to retain their spot in VCT.</p>

<p>Before Stage 1, DRX and T1 will compete at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>.</p>
