    <h1>VCT Pacific Stage 1 groups drawn</h1>

		<p>Following the conclusion of the five-map <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> lower final, the groups for Stage 1 of league play in VCT Pacific were <a href="https://x.com/vctpacific/status/1888220011480981856" target="_blank">drawn</a>.</p>

<p>Teams were seeded into five pools based on their placement at Kickoff.</p>

<p>Group Alpha:</p>



<p>Group Omega:</p>



<p>Matches will be played in a round-robin fashion within groups, and the top four teams from each group will qualify for the Stage 1 playoffs. The top three teams from playoffs will qualify for Masters Toronto. Groups will be re-drawn before Stage 2.</p>

<p>In 2024, VCT regions had just 11 teams, resulting in groups having six and five teams respectively. With the number of teams increasing to 12 in 2025, groups now have six teams each. Nongshim RedForce and BOOM Esports, who gained entry into VCT following <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2146/champions-tour-2024-pacific-ascension" target="_blank">Pacific Ascension</a>, will be looking to build toward qualification for Champions 2025 as they look to retain their spot in VCT.</p>

<p>Before Stage 1, DRX and T1 will compete at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>.</p>

		<p>To me, the 2 team in Ascention should be in the same group, because they are in direct concurrencies to qualify, and if one got an easy grouop, then, thats bad for the integrity of the competition</p>

		<p>well really they are only in direct contention with eachother for a spot next year if they both make it to champs. if they get grouped losing to 4 or 5 other teams then it makes sense for them to get relegated</p>

			<p>Yes and no, they are 3 outcome :</p>
<ul>
<li>Top 4  = world = qualified (If only one qual)</li>
<li>Top 8 = playoff = qualified for ascension</li>
<li>Top 12 = elim = relegated no matter what</li>
</ul>
<p>If team A is in an easy group and get qual to PO, and team B got an hard group and end bottom 2, then maybe B &gt; A, so thats unfair</p>
<p>(edit : plus it add more stakes to a game if 2 asc team plays each other)</p>		</div>

			<p>I do see what you mean, but the way i see it the system is structured so that an ascension team quals for next year if they prove themselves better than most other teams in the region, unrelated to the other ascension team.</p>
<p>(also I do agree seeing the two ascension teams face off does add a lot of stakes)</p>		</div>

<p>&#34;Imo the problem would be uneven groups. If both ascension teams get into a really hard group, they could get denied playoffs and any chance to qualify next year despite being possibly better than teams from the other group&#34;</p>		</div>
