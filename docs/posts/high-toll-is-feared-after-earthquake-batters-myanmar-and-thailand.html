Modeling by the United States Geological Survey estimated that the death toll was likely to <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pn9s/pager" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surpass 10,000</a>, and that there was a strong possibility of a much higher toll.</p><p>A preliminary count from Myanmar’s military government said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities — but that did not include Mandalay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The quake, measured by the U.S.G.S. at magnitude 7.7, was strong enough that it leveled a 33-story building that was under construction more than 600 miles away in Bangkok, in neighboring Thailand. At least eight people were confirmed dead there, and dozens more were missing, according to the authorities. They were all presumed to be members of the 320-person crew of workers who were putting up the new building for the Thai government.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/28/28-vid-bangkok-tower-25944-cover/28-vid-bangkok-tower-25944-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The moment when a 33-story building that was under construction collapsed in Bangkok, Thailand.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>@Khon Su Cheevit Adeet Mai Suay Rok Na/Facebook AFP</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. local time, was only the third of its size to hit the region in the past century, and the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pn9s/origin/detail" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S.G.S. analysis</a> placed the epicenter just 10 miles from the heart of Mandalay, a city of about 1.5 million people.

Because phone lines were down, he said, he was unsure if his parents had survived.</p><p>“But I can’t go back home yet,” he said. “I have to save lives here first.”</p><p>Dozens of patients at the hospital — the main medical center in Mandalay — fled the building when it jolted and shuddered, jamming together in a nearby parking lot.</p><p>Some patients were still connected to intravenous drips and oxygen tanks. Others had their heads and arms bandaged and were lined up on stretchers, moaning.

The Ava Bridge, a giant metal span, had partially collapsed into the Irrawaddy River. In Mandalay, monks in reddish robes cried out in shock as a multistory building at the New Masoeyein monastery fell near a toppled clock tower.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, about 70 miles from the epicenter, women wailed as the spire atop a century-old golden dome called a stupa toppled over, one of several that were damaged there. Rescue workers in other parts of the country dug through piles of twisted rebar and jagged concrete where buildings had been destroyed. Among the hard-hit places was Naypyidaw, the capital of the military government, about 150 miles from Mandalay.</p><p>The disaster compounded the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021 and have restricted the country’s contact with the outside world. The junta has been steadily weakened since then, losing ground to rebels amid a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/20/world/asia/myanmar-civil-war.html" title="">bloody civil war</a> that has left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An earthquake survivor at a hospital in Naypyidaw.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sai Aung Main/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>During past disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, Myanmar’s military rulers restricted the flow of international aid to hard-hit areas that were dominated by their foes.</p><p>But this time, the junta’s leaders immediately appealed for international help and declared a state of emergency in six regions of the country, news agencies reported, including Mandalay and Naypyidaw.</p><p>“We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said a military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volunteers looking for survivors in the wreckage of an earthquake-damaged building in Naypyidaw, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aung Shine Oo/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, said the organization was mobilizing to help people in need.

The junta has cracked down on doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of a civil disobedience movement opposed to the regime. Myanmar is considered <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/our-health-workers-are-working-fear-targeted-violence-against-health-care-one-year" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the most dangerous places in the world</a> to be a health worker, according to the New York-based Physicians for Human Rights.</p><p>Backed by military and financial support from China, India, Russia and Thailand, the junta controls about 20 percent of Myanmar, mainly urban areas. Its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, has been accused of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.</p><p>The military has persecuted ethnic minorities, and this month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/asia/rohingya-arsa-ataullah-arrest.html" title="">arrested the leader</a> of an armed group that has sought to protect Rohingya Muslims from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/world/asia/rohingya-myanmar-bangladesh-refugees-massacre.html" title="">scorched-earth campaign</a> of arson, mass rape and killing that the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/us/politics/myanmar-genocide-biden.html" title="">has called genocide</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Bangkok, Thailand, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ann Wang/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>In Bangkok, rescue workers were toiling into the night after the 33-story building collapsed.

Hours later, rescue workers and dogs searched for survivors amid fears that scores of people had been buried in the collapse.</p><p>In Mandalay, as the night deepened, terrified residents dragged mattresses and mosquito nets onto the streets to sleep.
