It is isolated, even by the standards of Afghanistan, a landscape of sheer mountain ridges, snow-capped peaks and river gorges, as beautiful as it is unforgiving.</p><p>The British mostly steered clear of the area in their doomed forays into Afghanistan that began in the 1800s.

The remnants of the airstrikes still mar the landscape today.</p><p>For the rest of his life, the elder Mr. Rabbani would carry the trauma of supporting the very people who had robbed him of his family. Overwhelmed with grief, he would ask anyone he met what his family might have done to deserve such a cruel end.</p><p>Though the attack barely resonated in Kabul, much less in Washington, it changed the dynamic in the Waygal Valley.

The Taliban was no longer a sideshow.</p><p>The Americans started building bases in the valley, giving Mullah Osman exactly what he wanted â a chance to prove that, whatever development the Americans promised, they would bring death.</p><p>And they did.
