The man’s sheared limb and ragged scars tell only half the story: His family was killed next to him, massacred as they fled the Taliban.</p><p>“This man was my sworn enemy,” said the Taliban commander, Mullah Osman Jawhari.</p><p>“But do you know who did this to him?” the commander asks, a garish smile spreading over his face.</p><p>“It was his friends, the Americans.”</p><h2 id="link-69762fbf">Turning Allies into Enemies</h2><p>When the war in Afghanistan began, there were almost no Taliban here, just a couple of bearded misfits the locals laughed at.</p><p>Then U.S. forces showed up, and this valley in Nuristan Province, surrounded by mountains of alpine forest, became the site of some of the most violent attacks on American soldiers since Vietnam.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Historians, journalists and military officials have spent years trying to understand how the Americans lost the valley.

But these attacks were different, residents here say. The Americans killed and maimed the very people who supported them most, swelling the Taliban’s ranks by turning allies into enemies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Convinced that Nuristan would become a transport hub and hide-out for Al Qaeda and its allies, the Americans built bases and aggressively patrolled an area that, for the better part of a century, had been granted autonomy from its own government.</p><p>Nuristan was never destined to be a focal point of the war on terror. It is isolated, even by the standards of Afghanistan, a landscape of sheer mountain ridges, snow-capped peaks and river gorges, as beautiful as it is unforgiving.</p><p>The British mostly steered clear of the area in their doomed forays into Afghanistan that began in the 1800s. The Russians, in their own failed bid more than a century later, barely entered. Even the Taliban avoided it during their rule in the 1990s.</p><p>Only the Americans dared to encroach into the region, and in doing so created the very insurgent stronghold they feared most.</p><p>The United States dropped more than 1,000 bombs in a place it never needed to be. Instead of winning hearts and minds, the Americans unwittingly sowed the seeds of their own demise here in the Waygal Valley — just as it did in much of Afghanistan — then stayed for years to reap the harvest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“You have to know when you are the problem,” said retired Col. William Ostlund, the commanding officer of the men who fought the battle in Want (sometimes referred to as Wanat).</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Col.

They are threatening the valley’s independence and risk squandering the good will of its people, much as the Americans did.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-2d23a5b0">War Diaries</h2><p>The school notebooks sit in bags scattered through the house, their bright jackets like tiny fragments of sky. They are part of Mullah Osman’s war menagerie, collected over two decades of conflict: compasses, rusted swords, duct-taped rifle cartridges — and dozens of light-blue Unicef notebooks.</p><p>Inside are the intimate details of his operations, battle plans and budgets: how many men, guns and bullets he assigned to each task. Along the margins are bits of poetry and hand-drawn roses, doodled in the idle hours of war.</p><p>This is a history known only to him, the war diaries of a famed Taliban commander.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-21"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise, from top left: a sword Mullah Osman says was used to execute spies over the 20 years of fighting the Americans and their proxy forces in Nuristan; a Chinese-made mortar sight; a children’s Unicef notebook used by Mullah Osman to plan the 2008 battle of Want; a small handheld radio used to listen to news; a suppressor used in battle and a rifle scope given to Mullah Osman by Taliban leadership.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Tall and rangy with a slender build, Mullah Osman has deep-set eyes and a purple scar above his cheek from a sledding accident, of all things.</p><p>Chased for years by the Americans, Mullah Osman vanished not long after the war ended. I tracked him down in his native village of Waygal, in his home of hewed wood and river stone, perched on the edge of a cascading river.</p><p>As he flips through the notebooks, he stops on a dog-eared copy: <em>The Battle of Want</em>.</p><p>Inside are maps and detailed renderings of the valley and routes into Want, mountain passes where his men smuggled weapons to avoid drone detection. The homes of allies and enemies are marked with Xs; looping arrows sweep up and down the page.</p><p>Sensing our interest, Mullah Osman shakes his head. The battle of Want did not start here, he says, pressing the torn cover between his thumb and forefinger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>“It began many years before.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mullah Osman in a cemetery near his home in Waygal.

The United States had a small presence in Afghanistan, with limited operations mostly focused on tracking down Osama bin Laden.</p><p>It wasn’t until 2003, the same year that the Pentagon optimistically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/02/world/aftereffects-kabul-us-declares-major-combat-in-afghanistan-to-be-over.html" title="">declared</a> an end to “major combat” in Afghanistan, that Americans even entered the Waygal Valley looking for Al Qaeda — and were received with open arms.</p><p>During an early patrol in the area, an American soldier fell from the side of the mountain, cascading down a stony chute. Villagers recall bringing him to the home of a local elder, where he was cared for until the Americans could retrieve him.</p><p>“The people didn’t care that he was an American,” Mullah Osman recalled. “They just wanted to help him.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Mullah Osman had no way of convincing them that the Americans were the enemy. He had not been interested in the Taliban, either, until the war began, an affront he said he could not ignore.</p><p>His father and uncles had fought the Russians for the same reason. Back then, he was a boy, studying in a madrasa and intent on becoming an Islamic scholar. After the Soviets withdrew, setting off a civil war, Mullah Osman appreciated the Taliban for putting an end to the fighting. But he had no desire to join them until the Americans invaded his country.</p><p>At first, almost none of his neighbors understood his outrage. Then, a series of airstrikes hit the valley, changing it forever.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The central market in Waygal, Nuristan. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>In October 2003, the C.I.A. launched an attack against a suspected terrorist in a mountaintop village, sending a trail of fire and smoke into the ink black sky.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Gunships strafed the forests where residents had run for safety. A cluster of wood-frame homes and a mosque were decimated; seven people were killed, some while fleeing.</p><p>The Americans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/11/world/6-afghans-die-in-us-raid-reports-say.html" title="">declared</a> the strike a success, a refrain that would become so common it would lose meaning.</p><p>In reality, the attacks had failed. Not only was their target not there, but the homes and mosque they struck belonged to a staunch American ally, a former governor of Nuristan named Mawlawi Ghulam Rabbani.</p><p>Mr. Rabbani’s political party, Jamiat-e-Islami, detested the Taliban — so much so that it had partnered with the Americans to overthrow them. In fact, that very night, Mr. Rabbani was in Kabul as part of a delegation of pro-American forces.</p><p>The only people sheltering in the mountainside home were his family and friends. Of the seven killed, most were women and children, and they included Mr. Rabbani’s son and daughter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abdullah Rabbani, photographed at the district governors office in Wanat, Nuristan. His family’s home was destroyed in an American airstrike.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>These were the early days of war, before civilian deaths from airstrikes became a flashpoint in U.S.-Afghan relations. When U.S. forces came to investigate the damage, one of Mr. Rabbani’s surviving sons was there, wandering the scorched hillside, looking for remains.</p><p>“They acted like it never happened,” the son said recently from the family home. The remnants of the airstrikes still mar the landscape today.</p><p>For the rest of his life, the elder Mr. Rabbani would carry the trauma of supporting the very people who had robbed him of his family. Overwhelmed with grief, he would ask anyone he met what his family might have done to deserve such a cruel end.</p><p>Though the attack barely resonated in Kabul, much less in Washington, it changed the dynamic in the Waygal Valley. If people were not yet ready to give up on the Americans, they no longer saw them as infallible liberators. A creeping sense of resentment, and injustice, opened a crack for the Taliban’s message to grow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>Before the attack, Mullah Osman and Mr. Rabbani had been enemies, the spokesmen for opposing visions of their country’s future. But at the funeral for the Rabbani family, Mullah Osman showed up to pay his respects.</p><p>He prayed with the family in the smoldering remains of their former mosque. Touched by his outreach, the surviving children gifted him a two-way radio — a means of communicating across the valley.</p><p>“Up to that point, the area was very peaceful. It was safe for everyone, even the American military,” Mullah Osman said.</p><p>“But after the attack on the Rabbani family,” he said, “the Taliban took over. And the uprising began.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-39"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mullah Osman, photographed on the hills above his home in Waygal.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><h2 id="link-58add898">‘Worse than the Americans’</h2><p>Young men came out to join Mullah Osman’s anemic ranks, driven by bitterness over the Rabbani killings.</p><p>Not that the Americans noticed. For the next three years, they largely left Nuristan alone, distracted by the fighting elsewhere in Afghanistan and by the new war in Iraq.</p><p>The Americans returned in 2006, convinced that Al Qaeda and its allies were sheltering in the mountains, but the valley had already been transformed. The Taliban was no longer a sideshow.</p><p>The Americans started building bases in the valley, giving Mullah Osman exactly what he wanted — a chance to prove that, whatever development the Americans promised, they would bring death.</p><p>And they did. In their search for Al Qaeda, they detained farmers and shepherds, dropped enough bombs to level a mountain and killed innocents, including a vehicle full of teenagers who failed to stop at a checkpoint.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>With public outrage growing, Mullah Osman’s popularity soared. He took more risks, ambushing foot patrols and lacing the dirt roads with explosives. With each skirmish, he spotted the tendencies and the vulnerabilities of the Americans.</p><p>Still, not everyone opposed the Americans. One family in particular stood out as the United States’ greatest proponents — and beneficiaries.</p><p>From the moment the Americans arrived, Rafiullah Arif’s family embraced them, much as the Rabbanis once had. The family leased the Americans land to build a base, and even offered their sons to assist with security, logistics, whatever needed doing.</p><p>Rafiullah, tall with a thick mop of black hair, became a loyal fixer for the Americans, helping with transport and supply and, at least according to Mullah Osman, intelligence gathering.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-44"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rafiullah, left, during an interview with The New York Times at his home on the knoll overlooking the former U.S. base at Bella.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>“These guys were worse than the Americans,” Mullah Osman said. “The Americans came for bin Laden, for Al Qaeda. But our own people? What reason did they have?”</p><p>Mullah Osman and Rafiullah became sworn enemies in a high-stakes game of local politics with global implications. The more the Americans alienated the people of the Waygal Valley, the closer they grew to the Taliban.</p><p>And the closer the locals grew to Mullah Osman, the more the Americans needed allies like Rafiullah.</p><h2 id="link-161e1e92">Self Defeat</h2><p>Colonel Ostlund arrived in Nuristan in 2007, inheriting the growing hostility toward the United States and the wild, impractical placement of the American bases. He marveled at their remoteness, and how little sense they made.</p><p>They had to be resupplied by helicopter in stark ravines where insurgents could fire at them freely and the weather could change in a flash. He worried constantly that a Taliban rocket would down a helicopter loaded with his men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><p>The mountains ran in excess of 10,000 feet, erupting from the river with such suddenness they nearly eclipsed the sky.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-49"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soaring peaks overlook the former site of the American base at Bella.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><p>Though Colonel Ostlund and his men had come to fight, they had no desire to do so at such a staggering disadvantage.</p><p>By then, Mullah Osman had far more men at his disposal. He organized them in teams of 10, with an imam, a team leader, a spotter with binoculars, a radio man, a gunner — and a cameraman to record every ambush.</p><p>He studied each battle, reviewing the tapes like a football coach. The videos became the centerpiece of his propaganda campaign, shared widely over mobile phones and on social media, evidence of the Taliban’s effectiveness against the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><p>But Mullah Osman wanted to do more — he wanted to overrun an American base and kill everyone inside.</p><p>And he almost did.</p><p>Nearly one year before the battle of Want, the Taliban stormed a separate base, in August 2007. Mullah Osman’s fighters got so close to overrunning it that the Americans had to fight hand-to-hand until air support arrived — so close that the pilots were forced to bomb the base itself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-53"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/00vid-Taliban-35624-cover/00vid-Taliban-35624-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A video provided by Mullah Osman, and used for propaganda purposes by the Taliban, shows the storming of the U.S. military base at Bella in August 2007.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p>Mullah Osman was injured by a grenade in the attack, but no Americans died.

Which left the Americans in a curious quagmire: The more they fought, the more violent things became.</p><p>“We didn’t have an understanding of the people, the culture,” Colonel Ostland said. “We didn’t really work with people or apologize for the bad things that happened.

Rafiullah and his family couldn’t even go to their local market without worrying that Mullah Osman’s men would kill them.

The Americans were exposed, and vulnerable.</p><p>Why not press the advantage, the lieutenant asked?</p><p>After all, the Taliban had fresh manpower — the Americans themselves had taken care of that.

They borrowed weapons from the Taliban in other areas, but also from the local villagers, who were happy to empty their armories for the cause.</p><p>To get heavy weapons to Want undetected, they broke down .50-caliber antiaircraft guns, smuggled them over the mountains and reassembled them on hillside perches.</p><p>“Want is like a bowl,” Mullah Osman explained.

The whistle and boom of rocket-propelled grenades followed from three directions.</p><p>From a boulder balanced in repose on the mountainside, Mullah Osman radioed his men to sustain the attack — to commit to the five minutes — because it might be all they had.</p><p>He targeted the heavy weapons first: a wire-guided missile system atop a Humvee, which burned like a pyre for the rest of the battle, and a munitions stockpile, which exploded into fiery debris.</p><p>Bullets pierced the base from every side. The volume of gunfire stunned the Americans, as did the intimacy of the battle. Opposing fighters were positioned so close they could see one another’s faces.</p><p>The most withering attack was levied against an American outpost called Topside, set on the hillside above the base. It had been hastily assembled in the days prior, and gave up high ground to the north and west. While most of the Americans were on the main base, only nine men were stationed at Topside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-37"><div><p>The first volley was ferocious and accurate, killing, wounding or stunning every man at Topside. And that was just the start. With every wave of grenades and gunfire, the insurgents pressed closer, charging within yards of the outpost.</p><p>Realizing the plight of the men at Topside, an American lieutenant and a medic left the main base to help. They rushed through the village and up the hill as gunfire chased them.</p><p>The rescue was short-lived. Not long after they entered the outpost, at least one Taliban fighter breached the perimeter, opened fire and killed them both. Eight of the nine Americans who died that day lost their lives at Topside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-80"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Copies of 26 dog tags of soldiers who fell in combat while under Col.

They had even returned the land that his family had given the Americans for their base.</p><p>Though the Taliban spared his life, it is a half-life, the life of an outcast.</p><p>He bites his tongue about the new government; he still fears them. As the Taliban lingered nearby, monitoring his words, he focused his ire on the Americans.</p><p>“They say they came here to help us, but they wound up killing us,” he said, squinting into the sun with his good eye. “We supported their mission, and they betrayed us.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-41"><div><h2 id="link-33992620">Peace, and Taxes</h2><p>The central bazaar buzzes with the sound of new construction, the scrape of concrete and sawing of timber as men huddle on rooftops, planning expansions.</p><p>“You can go anywhere in this country and no one will harm you,” Mullah Osman brags, sweeping his arm over the village of Want. “Now, the only people complaining are the coffin makers.”</p><p>At a newly opened stall selling soup by the market, the proprietor screws his face. Yes, he allows, selling soup in Want was not a viable business before the Americans left in 2021.

Its people practiced an ancient form of paganism and only converted to Islam in the 1890s, when the emir of Afghanistan conquered the territory and renamed it Nuristan, or the land of the light.</p><p>In that conquest, some regions converted peacefully, including the Waygal Valley, and were granted a special status by the emir. According to the locals, they were allowed to retain their resources in perpetuity — the land, water, minerals and timber. And they would be exempt from taxation.</p><p>Mullah Osman is loyal to the Taliban, but to Nuristan most of all.</p><p>“I would not support any effort to tax Nuristan,” he grumbles as the tax men drive away.</p><p>To his mind, he has already made enough concessions. When the new government came to power, they favored clerics over commanders, leaving the fighters who won the war jobless.

His son-in-law was an Afghan Special Forces soldier in Kandahar, and still wears his uniform around Mullah Osman’s home.

He and other Nuristani elders had been granted a rare meeting with Afghanistan’s supreme leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada.</p><p>They had spent weeks rehearsing what to say.</p><p>In the months before, the Taliban had formalized the decision to tax Nuristan, an invasive move given the history of the province.</p><p>Now, the government was preparing to go further: It had told the people of the valley that it was reclaiming their land, water and mineral rights — in short, their independence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-47"><div><p>Mullah Osman and the others had come in a last-ditch effort to beg the government to reconsider.</p><p>“I think this is just a misunderstanding,” Mullah Osman said, sounding less optimistic than he wanted to. “We just need to explain.”</p><p>When the United States launched its doomed foray in the Waygal Valley, it fundamentally misunderstood the place.
