The Supreme Court has allowed some initiatives to proceed and temporarily blocked others, issuing orders that have for the most part been technical and tentative.</p><p>The new case concerns an order issued on the first day of Mr. Trump’s second term. It revoked an executive order from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that had let transgender service members serve openly.</p><p>A week later, Mr. Trump issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a second order</a> saying that expressing what it called a false “gender identity” conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an “honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,” and that requiring others to recognize a “falsehood is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In February, the Defense Department implemented Mr. Trump’s order, issuing a new policy requiring all transgender troops to be forced out of the military. According to the Defense Department, about 4,200 current service members, or about 0.2 percent of the military, are transgender.</p><p>Service members sued to block the policy, saying it ran afoul of the Constitution’s equal protection clause.</p><p>In March, Judge Benjamin H. Settle, of the Federal District Court in Tacoma, Wash., <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344431/gov.uscourts.wawd.344431.104.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreed</a>, issuing a nationwide injunction blocking the ban.</p><p>The government had failed to show that the ban “is substantially related to achieving unit cohesion, good order or discipline,” wrote Judge Settle, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. “Although the court gives deference to military decision making, it would be an abdication to ignore the government’s flat failure to address plaintiffs’ uncontroverted evidence that years of open transgender service promoted these objectives.”</p><p>The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.afaa7f8c-a307-4e35-a174-cf2fa59424fe/gov.uscourts.ca9.afaa7f8c-a307-4e35-a174-cf2fa59424fe.31.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refused to block</a> Judge Settle’s ruling while it considered the administration’s appeal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, saying that “the district court’s injunction cannot be squared with the substantial deference that the department’s professional military judgments are owed.”</p><p>At a minimum, the government’s application said, the Supreme Court should limit Judge Settle’s ruling to the plaintiffs in the case and lift the balance of the nationwide injunction.</p><p>The court told the plaintiffs to file their brief opposing the ban on May 1, and the justices will probably rule on the government’s application not long after.</p><p>Judge Settle’s ruling followed <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.afaa7f8c-a307-4e35-a174-cf2fa59424fe/gov.uscourts.ca9.afaa7f8c-a307-4e35-a174-cf2fa59424fe.31.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a similar one</a> from Judge Ana C. Reyes of the Federal District Court in Washington. “The law does not demand that the court rubber-stamp illogical judgments based on conjecture,” wrote Judge Reyes, who was appointed by Mr. Biden.</p><p>The District of Columbia Circuit entered <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.41889/gov.uscourts.cadc.41889.1208724672.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an “administrative stay,”</a> saying the brief pause “should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits.” That court is expected to rule shortly on the government’s request that it block Judge Reyes’s ruling while the appeal proceeds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Early in his first term, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/trump-transgender-military.html" title="">announced a transgender ban on Twitter</a>, but the policy was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/us/transgender-ban-military.html" title="">blocked</a> by two federal judges.</p><p>Those injunctions were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/us/politics/transgender-ban-military-supreme-court.html" title="">lifted by the Supreme Court</a> in 2019 by a 5-to-4 vote, allowing a revised ban to take effect while legal challenges moved forward. The cases were dropped after Mr. Biden rescinded the ban.</p><p>In its application on Thursday, the administration said the policy blocked by the justices in 2019 was materially identical to the new one and urged them to rule the same way now.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
