    <h1>In Russia, Anniversary of Ukraine War Draws Little Public Mention</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>And local officials who typically toe the Kremlin’s line on glorifying the invasion — casting Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine as heroes and the war as a moral imperative — were uncharacteristically quiet on Monday.</p><p>Nor is Russia mourning its casualties — which U.S. intelligence <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/russia-casualties-ukraine-war.html" title="">estimates to be in the hundreds of thousands</a> including the wounded — in any public way on Monday.</p><p>However, independent Russian journalists in exile published a joint <a href="https://zona.media/news/2025/02/24/160k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> saying that Russia had lost over 165,000 soldiers in three years of fighting, based on publicly available data from court records. Those figures could not be independently confirmed, and Russia’s defense ministry refuses to disclose casualty figures.</p><p>A top Russian diplomat made no mention of the anniversary on Monday but praised the Trump administration’s efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-republicans.html" title="">draw closer to Mr. Putin</a> and bring an end to the war.</p><p>“A cease-fire without a long-term settlement is a path to renewed fighting and conflict at a later date with even graver consequences including for Russian-American ties,” Sergei A. Ryabkov, a deputy foreign minister, <a href="https://ria.ru/20250224/ryabkov-2001204768.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the RIA Novosti news agency, a week after Russian and U.S. officials sat down for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">talks</a> for the first time in three years.</p></div></div>
