Putin of Russia is not scheduled to attend any events on Monday for the anniversary of the full-scale invasion that he ordered, which has metastasized into Europe’s biggest military conflict since World War II.</p><p>Russian state TV opened Monday morning news bulletins with routine reports from the front lines in Ukraine, making no reference to the symbolism of the date.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And local officials who typically toe the Kremlin’s line on glorifying the invasion — casting Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine as heroes and the war as a moral imperative — were uncharacteristically quiet on Monday.</p><p>Nor is Russia mourning its casualties — which U.S. intelligence <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/russia-casualties-ukraine-war.html" title="">estimates to be in the hundreds of thousands</a> including the wounded — in any public way on Monday.</p><p>However, independent Russian journalists in exile published a joint <a href="https://zona.media/news/2025/02/24/160k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> saying that Russia had lost over 165,000 soldiers in three years of fighting, based on publicly available data from court records.
