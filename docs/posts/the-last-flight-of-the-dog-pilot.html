Just a few years earlier, Mr. Kim, a gregarious father of three, was anxiously leaving a stable career to pursue a childhood dream of flying. Now, at 49, he had a pilot’s license, his own single-engine plane and, as he proudly told his friends, a job lined up with a charter airline.</p><p>On this day, though, he was indulging in a passion project: volunteering as a transport pilot for shelter animals, joining a small fleet of planes that would help relocate 23 dogs and 12 cats to rescue organizations around the Northeast.</p><p>Among the dogs taking flight that afternoon was a 1-year-old Yorkshire terrier mix named Pluto, who had been discovered astray six weeks earlier along a highway in rural Georgia. Now Pluto found himself on a 1,000-mile odyssey that would carry him, in a quirky bit of fate, from an animal shelter just outside Albany, Ga., to an organization just outside Albany, N.Y.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Kim, petting and cooing at the animals on the tarmac, would be his chaperone for the final leg of the trip.</p><p>After a 20-minute layover and a few minor comforts — sips of water from a bowl, nibbles of freeze-dried liver, a couple of affectionate scratches behind the ear — Pluto and three other dogs were shepherded into Mr. Kim’s plane, a Mooney M20J. They nestled into crates that were padded with blankets and secured inside the cramped cabin with bungee cords.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
