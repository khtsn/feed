Trump’s electoral victory, thousands of people revived the grass-roots movement that opposed his first term in office.</p><p>Marchers in Manhattan took over streets carrying a block-wide banner that read, “We Won’t Back Down.” Activists in Los Angeles and Chicago decried Mr. Trump’s abortion and immigration policies and vowed to descend on Washington to protest his inauguration in January.</p><p>But participants noted that Mr. Trump had not appeared to be swayed by protests, petitions, hashtag campaigns or other tools of mass dissent. Many have been calling for a fresh playbook.</p><p>“I thought the first women’s march would be a turning point,” said Laura Bartek, a 45-year-old nurse from Virginia, referring to the protest — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html" title="">with nearly half a million people</a> — that took place after Mr. Trump’s 2017 inauguration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“To be here eight years later with these signs,” Ms. Bartek said during a recent protest in Washington, “it breaks my heart.”</p><p>“I keep getting emails to sign petitions,” said Leslie Mac, a digital strategist and communications expert who works with grass-roots organizations. “These people coming to the White House don’t care about petitions. They don’t care how many people sign them. They don’t care what they say.”</p><p>The first Trump presidency spawned the largest protests the country had seen in half a century.</p><p>But not everyone wants to participate in another four years of mass movement work. When Women’s March shared information about an upcoming rally on Instagram, one person responded, “No im tired, yall have fun though.” (Women’s March later hid some of the pushback and limited who could respond to a handful of posts.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I thought the first women’s march would be a turning point,” said Laura Bartek.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On TikTok, plans for the march were met with memes of women saying, “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sanilarena/video/7434972620749016363?lang=en&amp;q=womens%20march%20&amp;t=1731689750812" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get somebody else to do it</a>.” “This is an opportunity for a national brunch day for the 93 percent,” said one user, referring to the 93 percent of Black women who exit polls suggested had voted for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Others questioned whether the previous protests had resulted in substantial concessions.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s three Supreme Court appointees overturned Roe v. Wade after nearly half a million pink-hatted participants in the first women’s march called for upholding abortion rights. The Trump administration ultimately imposed a travel ban — barring most travelers from five majority Muslim countries, North Korea and Venezuela — even though large swaths of the public initially condemned the action. The demonstrations that erupted after the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis did not result in federal police reform laws under either Mr. Trump or President Biden.</p><p>And Mr. Biden has largely ignored fierce protests over Israel’s mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The left’s failure to shift policy has contrasted markedly with past mass movements that helped spur progressive legislative changes. Civil rights marches, lunch counter sit-ins and voter drives led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Protests against the Vietnam War pressured President Nixon to withdraw from the conflict. And AIDS-related activism moved the government to create and distribute medications that saved the lives of thousands of gay men and advanced equal rights for the L.G.B.T.Q. community.</p><p>The stark difference is in keeping with a sharp global reversal in the power of mass action, some political analysts say. At the beginning of this century, about two in three protest movements around the world could show measurable success, versus only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/world/middleeast/iran-protests-haiti-russia-china.html" title="">one in six today</a>, according to researchers at Harvard.</p><p>This is in part because more governments are leaning toward authoritarianism, and are less willing to respond to dissent, said Lisa Mueller, a professor at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., who studies why protest movements succeed or fail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“When AIDS activists barricaded the N.I.H., Tony Fauci invited them in for a conversation and forged a collaboration,” Ms. Mueller said. “The activists listened to the science, but they also started helping to set the scientific agenda.” Similarly, former President Lyndon B. Johnson was willing to negotiate with civil rights activists on legislation and government policy.</p><p>In contrast, Mr. Trump has said that he regrets not using the military to quell the Black Lives Matter protests. His advisers have recommended that he use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to crush future unrest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some demonstrators at the march in Washington said that they were there to rejuvenate a community around shared ideals.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L. Cross for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Some organizers reject the idea that mass actions during the first Trump administration were ineffective.</p><p>“We saw a big result from the Women’s March after the 2016 election,” said Shaunna Thomas, the co-founder of UltraViolet, which fights for feminist cultural and political change. She added: “The feminist movement grew significantly, both online and offline. And you saw some significant electoral wins two years later.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Thomas also said that gerrymandering and Republican control of the courts have made it difficult for left-leaning voters to gain and maintain political power.</p><p>Some activists said they were rethinking how and where to organize. Some of the biggest changes may be around how people think about the online organizing that has characterized the past 20 years of movement work, such as petition writing and hashtag campaigns.</p><p>“Digital spaces are not your friend anymore,” said Ms. Mac, who said that some groups are organizing less on social media for fear of online attacks by political opponents. Social media platforms, she noted, are controlled by executives like Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, who congratulated Mr. Trump on his win, or like Elon Musk, who has become a key player in the transition.</p><p>Wariness of social media will reduce the reach that activists have had, but it could also have unexpected upsides.</p><p>“Social media turned activism organizing into a kind of public relations job, where your follower count and where you were quoted mattered as much as the tangible work that was being done,” Ms. Mac said. “I’m not saying that good things didn’t happen in online spaces. But sponsorships and brand deals started to intermingle with activism. It was celebrity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Trump era could usher in a revival of local, in-person activism as people find new places to put their energy with people they know well. Already, during the Biden administration, conservative grass-roots activists pushed successfully for abortion bans, remaking school curriculums and banning books from libraries. Liberal grass-roots groups emerged to reverse some of those measures.</p><p>Activists also predict a rise in mutual aid groups within, for example, immigrant communities targeted for deportation under a new Trump administration.</p><p>Other activists said that they would continue the work of getting like-minded peers elected to positions of power.</p><p>“We’ve marched so much. We’re tired of doing the same thing over and over,” said David Hogg, who was among the students in Parkland, Fla., who mobilized on behalf of gun control legislation in the wake of the mass shooting there. “After the election, I got several texts saying, ‘Screw it. People in power don’t know what they’re doing and I need to run.’”</p><p>“We need to be positioned to bring a new generation into office so we’re not just protesting and marching,” Mr. Hogg said. “We can’t be outside looking in.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Protesters who took to the streets after the election said that they were there to rejuvenate a community around shared ideals.</p><p>Ms. Bartek carried signs and buttons from the past decade of protests that she has attended: the 2017 Women’s March, the 2022 protest on the Supreme Court steps when the justices overturned Roe. She said that her great-great-grandmother was a suffragist, and her grandmother attended the March on Washington in 1963, when Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech.</p><p>“Protesting makes me personally feel better,” she said. “I want to believe that the majority of Americans are good.”</p><p>The protests this month also drew out younger people who were not around for past marches.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sydney Cameron, left, and Kira Miller, students at the University of Richmond, attended the protest in Washington earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eze Amos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Kira Miller, a 19-year-old student at the University of Richmond who attended a protest in Washington, said she believed that failures in the education system cause young voters to be uninformed, and therefore apolitical or apathetic; marches can help bridge that gap. “There is power in the visual impact of protests,” she said, “and in the attention that they bring to issues.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Her classmate, Sydney Cameron, 19, said that in 2016 she expected to see a woman elected president. “This year I thought I’d see another historic moment,” she said, “and it failed again.”</p><p>Ms. Cameron said she recently asked her grandmother, who lived through the civil rights movements of the 1960s, whether it was worth going into the streets.</p><p>“She told me, ‘Sydney, it’s always a fight worth fighting,’” Ms. Cameron said. “‘Will the fight end? No. But this is not the time to sit back and watch and let this happen all over again.’” She added: “‘You fight for your daughter, and your daughter fights for hers.’”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Nov. 20, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a type of treatment that helped save the lives of many gay men.
