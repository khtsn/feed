    <h1>Stocks Notch Gains After More Tariff Whiplash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Even a quick tariff resolution with key partners leaves the economy under pressure from structurally higher trade costs and consumer spending headwinds,” Citibank’s equity analysts wrote in a research note on Sunday.</p><p>Investors and analysts have also become concerned about sharp swings in the U.S. government bond market, known as the Treasury market.</p><p>The 10-year Treasury yield, which is one of the most important interest rates in the world, underpinning debt markets around the world, rose to roughly 4.5 percent on Friday, from less than 4 percent the week before.</p><p>Such a sharp rise in yield, which corresponds to a sharp drop in price, is unusual, and signaled a broad shift away from U.S. markets, with the U.S. dollar falling in tandem.</p><p>The market swings, propelled by major policy shifts from the White House, have left some in the market feeling paralyzed. Consumers and business leaders have reported feeling similarly stuck, uncertain about the future.</p><p>“Right now, we can say with a straight face that the world may look vastly different in a year or two’s time than any other environment we have lived through,” said Henry Peabody, a strategist at Riverhead Research. He added that equities would need to fall further to offer “a margin of safety” before he would recommend buying into the market again. Until then, he said, “It’s hurry up and wait.”</p></div></div>
