The primary motif of the series — created, written and directed by Mike White — has always been to satirize the wealthy who, even while enveloped by the world’s most tranquil and extraordinary surroundings, can’t help but indulge their egos or keep up with their ever-growing list of grievances. They can’t relax either.</p><p>“I just was like, I should just do a show about people on vacation who have money, and how money is impacting all of their relationships,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/arts/television/white-lotus-mike-white.html" title="">White told The New York Times</a> in 2021, ahead of the Season 1 premiere.</p><p>Viewers are waiting to see what bombshells drop in the finale; prior seasons have included a murder among the rich hotel guests, who are pilloried for their privilege and lack of self-awareness. Their turmoil is interwoven with the working-class concerns of the hotel staff.</p><p>The plot of Season 3, which was largely filmed in at a Four Seasons in Thailand, has already included an incestuous sexual encounter between brothers; suicidal and homicidal ideation by a father who unravels as his shady business dealings are threatened with exposure; and ample drug and alcohol use.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Despite its themes, brands have not been squeamish about tying their names to “The White Lotus.” Barlow told The New York Times this week via email that these “very intentional” partnerships “were not designed to speak to the extraordinary storytelling within the series, but to feed the curiosity many fans have” around the fictional hotel chain.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A group of friends portrayed by, from left, Carrie Coon, Leslie Bibb and Michelle Monaghan are among the wealthy travelers in Season 3.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fabio Lovino/HBO, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Unlike memorable product placement of the past (like the <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/news/stranger-things-eggo-waffles" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eggo waffles in “Stranger Things”</a> or <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/07/25/better-call-saul-nippy-cinnabon/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cinnabon in “Better Call Saul”</a>), these licensed products did not appear onscreen, but were designed for the real world — for fans to bring into their living rooms, closets and daily life. Neither White nor the show’s production team were involved in the branding campaigns.</p><p>There was a time when a sudden flurry of licensing deals could be interpreted as a last gasp attempt at cultural relevance, but that’s not the case with “The White Lotus,” which is one of HBO’s biggest <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/the-white-lotus-audience-record-season-3-episode-6-1236348266/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hits</a>, reaching around 15 million viewers per episode, with some setting <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/the-white-lotus-audience-record-season-3-episode-6-1236348266/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">viewership highs</a>.</p><p>In fact, online fascination with the show helped spur HBO to ramp up the effort from previous seasons, which had minimal partnerships. On TikTok alone, recent <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/white-lotus-style?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posts dedicated</a> to “White Lotus” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@great_dayn?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">style have been viewed</a> millions of time.</p><p>“We have seen fans become enamored with the world through social posts, their theories,” Barlow said, adding that fans have been seeking out opportunities to step into the “White Lotus” world.</p><p>There is plenty of proof that viewers are willing to buy into the fantasy that the show sells. The previous two seasons, set in Hawaii and Italy and filmed at Four Seasons locations, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/travel/thailand-white-lotus-hotels.html" title="">turned both locales into “it” destinations</a>. Online interest in the Maui property jumped by 425 percent after Season 1 aired, according to the company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When it was announced in February 2024 that Season 3 would be set in Thailand, searches for the Southeast Asian country jumped 50 percent on Expedia, the online travel agency.</p><p>Living a TV show, so to speak, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/arts/television/squid-game-the-trials.html" title="">become a growing business in recent years</a>, as more networks and streamers offer immersive, interactive experiences for fans often referred to as brand activations or brand experiences.</p><p>Fans of “Friends” <a href="https://friendstheexperience.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">can hang out</a> in Monica and Rachel’s apartment. Devotees of Hulu’s comedy-mystery “Only Murders in the Building” could wander throughout the Manhattan theater where Season 3 was filmed ahead of the finale and examine clues to try to solve the season’s whodunit. In a long-running event in New York City, fans of Netflix’s dystopian blood bath “Squid Game” <a href="https://squidgameexperience.com/new-york/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">participate</a> in versions of the series’s twisted playground games — and come out alive. (Korean snacks, cocktails and shopping follow.)</p><p>Other HBO shows like “Game of Thrones” and “The Last of Us” have received similar treatment. “These campaigns are all aimed at bringing our original series to life,” Barlow said, “creating signature experiences that fans can touch and feel.”</p><p>Or as White said in 2021 about what inspired him to create “The White Lotus” to begin with: “There’s something about vacationing in other people’s realities.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maya Salam is an editor and reporter, focusing primarily on pop culture across genres.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maya-salam">More about Maya Salam</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
