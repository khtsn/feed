The stuff people tossed away and probably never thought about again — dirty yogurt cups, old Coke bottles — became some of the most redistributed objects on the planet, typically winding up thousands of miles away. It was a bewildering process, one that began with the export of toxic industrial waste. By the late 1980s, thousands of tons of hazardous chemicals had left the United States and Europe for the ravines of Africa, the beaches of the Caribbean and the swamps of Latin America.</p><p>In return for this cascade of toxins, developing countries were offered large sums of cash or promised hospitals and schools. The result everywhere was much the same. Many countries that had broken from Western imperialism in the 1960s found that they were being turned into graveyards for Western industrialization in the 1980s, an injustice that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/obituaries/daniel-arap-moi-dead.html" title="">Daniel arap Moi</a>, then the president of Kenya, referred to as “garbage imperialism.” Outraged, dozens of developing nations banded together to end waste export. The resulting treaty — the <a href="https://www.basel.int/theconvention/overview/history/overview/tabid/3405/default.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Basel Convention</a>, entered into force in 1992 and ratified by nearly every nation in the world but not the United States — made it illegal to export toxic waste from developed to developing countries.</p><p>If only the story had ended there. Despite that legislative success, the poorer nations of the world have never stopped being receptacles for the West’s ever-proliferating rubbish. The situation now is, in many respects, worse than it was in the 1980s. Then, there was widespread recognition that waste export was immoral. Today, most waste travels under the guise of being recyclable, cloaked in the language of planetary salvation. For the past two years I’ve been traveling the globe — from the plains of Romania to the slums of Tanzania — in an attempt to understand the world trash is making. What I saw was terrifying.</p><p>I started in Accra, the capital of Ghana, where millions of faltering electronics have been “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-donations-from-the-west-are-inundating-ghana-with-toxic-waste" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">donated</a>” by Western companies and universities since the 2000s. There I met communities of “burner boys,” young migrants from the country’s desert fringes who make cents an hour torching American cellphone chargers and television remotes once they stop working. They told me about coughing up blood at night. It’s no surprise: The section of Accra they inhabit, a squalid estuary known as Agbogbloshie, regularly ranks among Earth’s most poisoned places. Anyone who eats an egg in Agbogbloshie, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-06-2021-soaring-e-waste-affects-the-health-of-millions-of-children-who-warns" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>, will absorb 220 times the tolerable daily intake of chlorinated dioxins, a toxic byproduct of electronic waste.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It’s not just your old DVD player getting shipped to West Africa. Today’s waste trade is an opportunistic bonanza, an escape valve of environmental responsibility that profits off routing detritus of every conceivable variety to places that are in no position to take it. Your discarded clothes? They may go to a desert in Chile. The last cruise ship you boarded? Hacked to pieces in Bangladesh. Your depleted car battery? Stacked in a warehouse in Mexico. Is some of it run by <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/bmb/environmental-crime/FINAL_for_printing_-_Cash_in_the_Trash.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organized crime</a>? Of course. “For us,” a Naples mafioso boasted in 2008, “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/naples-garbage-is-mafia-gold-idUSL08305772/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rubbish is gold</a>.” But much of it doesn’t have to be. Waste export remains scandalously underregulated and unmonitored. Practically <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353380047_An_Independent_Study_into_Fly-tipping_and_Unregistered_Waste_Carriers_in_England" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anyone</a> can give it a go.</p><p>Nowhere does today’s waste trade reach more boggling dimensions than with plastic. The time scales alone are dizzying. Bottles or takeaway cartons that you own for moments embark on arduous, monthslong, carbon-spewing journeys from one end of the Earth to another. Upon arrival in villages in Vietnam or the Philippines, for example, some of these objects get chemically reduced — an energy-intensive task that unleashes innumerable toxins and microplastics into local ecosystems. The process’s ability to produce new plastic is at best dubious, but the environmental and health cost is cataclysmic. Plastic waste in the developing world — clogging waterways, exacerbating air pollution, infiltrating human brain tissue — is now linked to the death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/mismanaged-waste-kills-up-to-a-million-people-a-year-globally" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands</a> every year.</p><p>The fate of much other plastic waste that gets sent to the global south is more rudimentary: It gets incinerated in a cement factory or dumped in a field. In Turkey, I met marine biologists who fly drones along the Mediterranean coast to search for stray piles of European plastic waste, which <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1235938/annual-plastic-waste-exports-destinations-european-union/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enters</a> the country at the rate of one dump truck roughly every 15 minutes. In Kenya, a country that outlawed plastic bags in 2017 only for the American petrochemical sector to conspire to turn it into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/climate/oil-kenya-africa-plastics-trade.html" title="">Africa’s next waste frontier</a>, more than half the cattle that wander urban areas have been found to possess <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51546277" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plastic</a> in their stomach linings, while a shocking <a href="https://www.waterunite.org/blog/post/19736/are-you-pulling-your-weight-in-plastic--a-water-unite-deep-dive/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">69 percent</a> of discarded plastic is believed to enter a water system of one form or another.</p><p>That still pales in comparison to what I witnessed in Indonesia. Across the country’s 17,000-odd islands, domestically consumed plastic is so mishandled that <a href="https://www.fairplanet.org/story/indonesia-plastic-crisis-river-jakarta/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">365 tons</a> of it are believed to enter the sea every hour. And yet, deep in the highlands of Java, there are hellscapes of imported Western waste — toothpaste tubes from California, shopping bags from the Netherlands, deodorant sticks from Australia — stacked knee-high as far as the eye can see. Too voluminous to even attempt to recycle, it is used as fuel in scores of bakeries that supply Java’s street markets with tofu, a culinary staple. The result is some of the most lethal cuisine imaginable, with poisons from incinerated Western plastic ingested hourly by great numbers of Indonesians.</p><p>Can the waste trade ever be legislated into oblivion? As with drug trafficking, it may be that there’s too much money going around to fix the problem. Traveling trash, after all, has many advantages. Rich countries lose a liability and garbage producers are let off the hook. The need to find a place to put all our rubbish has never been more dire: A recent <a href="https://unctad.org/news/global-plastic-trade-40-bigger-previously-thought-study-finds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations study</a> found that one out of every 20 objects moving through global supply chains is now some form of plastic — amounting to a trillion-dollar annual industry worth more than the global arms, timber and wheat trades combined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Most crucially, it’s hard for Western consumers to recognize the extent of the crisis — that the story they’ve been told about recycling often isn’t true — when it is continually rendered invisible, relocated thousands of miles away. Yeo Bee Yin, the former environmental minister of Malaysia, may have put it to me best: The only way to really stop waste from entering her country, she told me, would be to close Malaysia’s ports entirely.</p><p>We might at the very least be honest with ourselves about what we are doing. We ship our waste to the other side of the planet not only because we produce far too much of it but also because we insist on an environment exorcised of our own material footprints. Everything you’ve ever thrown away in your life: There’s a good chance a lot of it is still out there, somewhere<em>, </em>be it headphones torched for their copper wiring in Ghana or a sliver of Solo Cup bobbing across the Pacific Ocean<em>.</em></p><p>Here the old adage doesn’t ring true. Rare is the trash that becomes anyone’s treasure.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
