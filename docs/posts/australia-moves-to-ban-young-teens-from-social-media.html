They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-parliament-house-canberra-31" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed legislation</a>, which puts Australia at the forefront of regulating social media access for children, would hold platforms accountable for enforcing the new rules, Mr. Albanese said. There will be no exemptions for children with parental permission, he said, but neither underage users nor their parents will face punishment for violations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He said that the legislation would be introduced to the national cabinet at a meeting on Friday and that, if passed by Parliament, the new restrictions would take effect 12 months later.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Social media is doing harm to our kids and I’m calling time on it,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mick Tsikas/Australian Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>X, TikTok and Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In an <a href="https://westernsydney.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/2052160/Open_letter_re_social_media_bans.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open letter</a> published last month, more than 100 experts and organizations in Australia and elsewhere acknowledged the serious risks posed by social media but raised reservations about keeping children from information and connections online that may help them develop.</p><p>“Any restrictions in the digital world must therefore be designed with care, and we are concerned that a ‘ban’ is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively,” they wrote.</p><p>Experts say social media can be both positive and negative for children, depending on how they use it. But children’s undeveloped brains may make them especially sensitive to social feedback, and they may become overly preoccupied with securing “likes,” followers and comments from peers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Unfortunately, most kids are pushed to use social media simply to get followers,” said Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association. “They are likely to compare themselves to others. They are exposed to cyber-hate. They are often exposed to content that teaches them how to engage in unhealthy or dangerous or disordered behaviors.”</p><p>Dr. Prinstein said legislation like that proposed by Mr. Albanese may be a valuable interim measure.</p><p>“We really need the tech companies to make their products appropriate for kids, whose brains are in a really important period of development,” he said. “Until that happens, we may need policies like this to protect kids from the worst parts of social media.”</p><p>Mr. Albanese, the prime minister, said Thursday that he would meet soon with families, among them the parents of a 12-year-old Sydney girl who killed herself in September after being bullied, according to her parents.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
