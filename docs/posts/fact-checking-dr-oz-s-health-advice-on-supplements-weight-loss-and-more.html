Nonetheless, his longtime focus on prevention seems to align with the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stated intentions</a> to address America’s chronic disease “epidemic.” </p><p>The New York Times analyzed claims Dr. Oz has made about preventive health measures across 2,500 television appearances, clips from “The Dr. Oz Show,” social media posts and other public statements. We then asked experts to weigh in on the evidence behind some of his common claims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Much of Dr. Oz’s advice is rooted in strong science and conventional wisdom: Eat well, move more, prioritize sleep. But he has also frequently pushed products and hacks that have little to no scientific evidence showing that they stave off disease, drawing scrutiny from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/well/dr-oz-health-medicare-record.html" title="">members of Congress</a> and <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7346" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from researchers.</a> In some cases, he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/health/dr-oz-medicare-finances-conflicts.html" title="">had financial ties</a> to the products he has promoted. </p><p>Some of his claims have raised concerns among medical experts about how Dr. Oz might use his perch if he is confirmed.</p><p>Dr. Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said that some of Dr. Oz’s talking points, like those about weight loss and supplements, were “surprising, coming from somebody with medical training, who you would think would approach this a bit more scientifically.”</p><p>“But he has said on numerous occasions that he wants to give people hope,” she added.</p><p>Dr. Oz did not respond to a request for comment.</p><h2 id="link-29ca1c2e">The Claim: Fish Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplements Are Good for Your Heart</h2><p>In online columns and on episodes of his show, Dr. Oz has discussed the wide-ranging benefits of “superstar” omega-3 fatty acids in food. He has also touted fish oil supplements that contain omega-3s as a way of preventing heart disease and other conditions. The supplements include those sold on iHerb, a company he has served as a spokesman for and has invested in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Many people without heart disease take fish oil pills to prevent it, but <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/new-cochrane-health-evidence-challenges-belief-omega-3-supplements-reduce-risk-heart-disease" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reviews of studies</a> on fish oil have not found these supplements prevent cardiovascular issues, said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements.</p><p>“I see this all the time,” he added. “People who are totally healthy will be like, ‘Oh yeah, I take omega-3.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/well/eat/omega-3-fish-oil-heart-health.html" title="">Some studies</a> have even found that fish oil pills may actually raise the risk of developing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/well/live/afib-atrial-fibrillation.html" title="">an irregular heartbeat</a>. However, there is evidence that people with pre-existing heart disease or high triglycerides levels may <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/omega3-supplements-what-you-need-to-know" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">benefit from the supplements.</a> And extensive research shows that eating a diet rich in fatty acids is beneficial to your overall health.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-4140235c">The Claim: Sunlight Will Make You Healthier</h2><p>Spending 15 to 20 minutes basking in the sun without sunscreen can cure any number of ills, Dr. Oz has said on his show, in blog posts and on TikTok. It can energize you, reduce depression, cut cancer risk and lower your blood pressure, he has claimed. He most commonly attributes these benefits to <a href="https://www.oprah.com/health/health-benefits-of-sun_2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vitamin D</a>, which the skin produces when exposed to ultraviolet light.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>There has been a fair amount of scientific controversy over vitamin D. Dr. Oz has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBa9_PwxoGU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised that</a> before his viewers, but he has also promoted vitamin D supplements, including those sold by iHerb.</p><p>Though vitamin D is a necessary nutrient for strong bones, Americans also get it from their diet, including fortified foods, said Dr. Steven Wang, the chief of dermatology at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, Calif. And a large <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3046611/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">body of research</a> has <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793446" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been inconclusive about other health benefits</a>, such as reducing the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1809944" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incidence of cancers, heart attack</a> or stroke. On the other hand, Dr. Wang said, there is a known risk associated with chronic sun exposure: skin cancer. About five million new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-73e059ea">The Claim: Certain Meats Raise Cancer Risk</h2><p>Eat red, processed, or charred meats only in moderation, or avoid them altogether, Dr. Oz has advised on his show, in TV appearances and on public posts. That guidance comes from his concern that they increase the risk of cancer.</p><p>On this point, experts agree. There is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)00444-1/fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strong evidence</a> that consuming red and processed meat increases the risk of digestive and other cancers, said Carrie Daniel-MacDougall, a nutritional epidemiologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas. The iron in meat, along with the chemicals that are used to preserve it, or that are produced when it is cooked at very high temperatures, can damage DNA, cause inflammation and produce toxic compounds when digested, Dr. Daniel-MacDougall said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-43c48308">The Claim: Supplements Work for Weight Loss</h2><p>Pine nuts, apple cider vinegar, “teatoxing,” supplements containing green-coffee-bean extract, raspberry ketones: The list of weight loss hacks Dr. Oz has promoted on his show over the years goes on.</p><p>“These kinds of things make people feel like they’re doing something positive for their health,” Dr. Nestle said.</p><p>But there is no rigorous research that supports weight loss supplements, Dr. Cohen said. There may be theoretical benefits to some of the products Dr. Oz has promoted — for example, Dr. Nestle said it’s possible that the fermentation in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/well/eat/apple-cider-vinegar-benefits.html" title="">apple cider vinegar</a> might slightly aid with digestion. But there is not substantial evidence that these items lead to weight loss.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-13"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-6827a3ab">The Claim: Probiotics Are Good for Gut Health</h2><p>Dr. Oz has talked about the perks of probiotics — live microorganisms sometimes known as “good bacteria” — including improving gut health. He has promoted iHerb’s probiotic supplements on social media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>One theory behind the benefits of probiotics is that they bolster the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/22/well/eat/gut-microbiome-health.html" title="">gut microbiome</a>. But there is no consensus on whether a generic probiotic pill helps healthy people, said Justin L. Sonnenburg, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University. The contents of these supplements can also vary. And because everyone has a different gut microbiome, people’s reactions to specific probiotics are hard to predict, he said.</p><p>Dr. Sonnenburg does, however, recommend eating foods like kimchi and kefir that contain microbes that are good for the gut. These foods also contain beneficial substances, called metabolites, that are not found in most supplements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-17"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-2049f4b0">The Claim: You Should Exercise to Lower Disease Risk</h2><p>Dr. Oz long promoted exercise on his show as a way to ward off Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, cardiovascular issues and more. A wealth of research has shown that to be legitimate. Even regular <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/well/move/exercise-bursts-benefits.html" title="">short bursts of exercise</a> — like the 10-minute or less workout routines Dr. Oz frequently highlighted on his show — are linked with a lower chance of cancer and other diseases. Exercise also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/well/mind/exercise-mental-health-cognition.html" title="">strengthens the brain,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/well/move/exercise-heart-health.html" title="">bolsters heart health</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/well/move/exercise-immunity-covid.html" title="">improves the immune system</a>’s defense against infections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-19"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-3ecd2f85">The Claim: Socializing Is Vital for Good Health</h2><p>Your heart needs a reason to keep beating, Dr. Oz told his fans time and again. He has called loneliness an “epidemic.” On Valentine’s Day, he <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr_oz/video/7471432358487526687" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a TikTok</a> in front of a Rodin statue at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., opining that friendships “reduce your blood pressure, reduce your chronic pain, your anxiety, your depression.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Researchers have theorized that social connections are vital for managing stress, which in turn can help keep blood pressure in check. Social isolation <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/loneliness-and-social-isolation/loneliness-and-social-isolation-tips-staying-connected#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%20loneliness%20and,%2C%20depression%2C%20and%20cognitive%20decline." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has also been linked</a> to an increased risk of depression, heart disease and cognitive decline, particularly <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/social-isolation-loneliness-older-people-pose-health-risks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">among</a> older adults. And studies have <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979493/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/article/53/1/65/4969712" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a link</a> between social isolation and chronic pain.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-23"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-273d3f4">The Claim: Poor Sleep Raises Cancer Risk</h2><p>America is facing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylyt9n8VByU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“sleep crisis,”</a> according to Dr. Oz. He has said that inadequate sleep can <a href="https://www.oprah.com/health/5-wrong-turns-that-can-lead-to-cancer-dr-oz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increase your risk of cancer</a>, lead to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkkGcLccmcI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high blood pressure</a> and make it hard to lose weight.</p><p>“Sleep is beneficial for your health, but the body of evidence on sleep duration and cancer is not consistent,” said Trang VoPham, an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Washington. Several studies and research reviews <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6249821" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have found no association</a> between the two, while a few have linked sleeping for nine hours or more with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</p><p>Dr. VoPham said there is evidence that night-shift workers, whose schedules are chronically misaligned with their exposure to light, are at increased risk for <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8832572/#section18-07487304211064218" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obesity</a> and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8011353/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancer</a>. Chronic poor sleep is also associated with an increased risk of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-022-00747-7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insulin resistance</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33611935/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high blood pressure</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Dani Blum is a health reporter for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dani-blum">More about Dani Blum</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><p>Nina Agrawal is a Times health reporter.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nina-agrawal">More about Nina Agrawal</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/mehmet-oz">Mehmet Oz</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/well/dr-oz-health-claims-fact-check.html">178</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/well/dr-oz-health-claims-fact-check.html">178</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">A Guide to Better Nutrition</h2><hr/><ul><li><p>We talked to nutrition experts and came up with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/well/eat/healthy-eating-tips.html">10 tips for healthier eating</a>.</p></li><li><p>Nutrition experts say frozen foods are not only as good as fresh, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/well/eat/frozen-food-health-benefits-tips.html">they’re often better</a>.</p></li><li><p>Could dark chocolate reduce your risk of diabetes? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/well/eat/dark-chocolate-diabetes-study.html">A new study suggests that it might</a>.</p></li><li><p>We asked scientists to help <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html">clear up the confusion about how seed oils</a> — canola oil, corn oil, sunflower oil and other refined oils made from the seeds of certain plants — affect our bodies.</p></li><li><p>How healthy are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/well/eat/chickpeas-health-benefits-recipes.html">chickpeas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/well/eat/citrus-health-benefits-recipes.html">citrus fruit</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/well/eat/sweet-potatoes-health-benefits-recipes.html">sweet potatoes</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/well/eat/apples-health-benefits-recipes.html">apples</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/well/eat/tuna-fish-mercury.html">tuna</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/well/pasta-chickpea-bean-legume.html">legume pasta</a>?
