Ms. Menendez’s trial was delayed after she was diagnosed with breast cancer; she underwent a mastectomy and completed reconstructive surgery less than two weeks ago, according to her lawyer and her husband.</p><p>The start of her trial unfolded in a starkly different fashion than her husband’s. During Mr. Menendez’s trial, the courtroom buzzed with reporters and teams of lawyers representing Mr. Menendez and two of his co-defendants, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, New Jersey businessmen who were convicted of bribing the senator.</p><p>On Monday, however, Ms. Menendez arrived at court alone. Wearing a pink surgical mask and a gray sweater with decorative fringe, she sat by herself in the courtroom for much of the morning as the judge, prosecutors and her lawyer, Barry Coburn, awaited the arrival of a late juror.</p><p>Mr. Coburn’s opening statement was brief. He urged jurors to keep in mind the claims made by prosecutors and to scrutinize the testimony presented for evidence of Ms. Menendez’s “knowledge and intent.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He repeatedly said that the prosecutors had presented a “nefarious” depiction of the events.</p><p>“There will be an absolute, utter failure of proof in this case with respect to knowledge and intent,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tracey-tully">More about Tracey Tully</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>In the Ring, His Parents’ Money Doesn’t Matter:</strong> Sean O’Bradaigh grew up in a world of Manhattan privilege, but private schools and ski vacations have nothing on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/in-the-ring-it-doesnt-matter-how-much-money-his-parents-have.html">dream of being a professional boxer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Subway Ninja’:</strong> In the lowest moment of Selwyn Bernardez’s life, he attacked a stranger with a sword.
