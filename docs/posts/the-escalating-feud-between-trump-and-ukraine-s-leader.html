The Ukrainian leader offered some of his most overt criticism yet of the U.S. president, saying that Trump was living in a “web of disinformation.”</p><p>In a social media post littered with falsehoods, Trump responded that Zelensky was a “dictator without elections” who took money from the U.S. to go to war with Russia and “has done a terrible job.” He also suggested that Ukraine’s future security would not be the America’s problem. “We have a big, beautiful Ocean as separation,” Trump said.</p><p>The comments were the latest move in what Peter Baker, our chief White House correspondent, described as “one of the most jaw-dropping pivots in American foreign policy in generations.” Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html" title="">as Peter explained</a>, has made clear that he is essentially done viewing Russia as a adversary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>In Ukraine, </strong>Trump’s comments have left many people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukrainians-trump-voices.html" title="">stunned and disillusioned</a>.</p><p><strong>In Russia, </strong>residents expressed optimism — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/russia-ukraine-trump-talks.html" title="">even glee</a> — that their country’s shunning would soon end.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4eb992ba">Trump moved to end New York’s congestion tolls</h2><p>Likening himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-king-image.html" title="">to a king on social media</a>, Trump declared this afternoon that “congestion pricing is dead” after his administration said that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/nyregion/trump-congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">intended to revoke federal approval of New York City’s new tolls</a>. The president had campaigned on ending the program, which for the last month has charged drivers $9 to enter Manhattan’s busiest streets.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/19/nyregion/congestion-pricing-termination-letter.html" title="">a letter to Gov. Kathy Hochul</a>, the president’s transportation secretary outlined Trump’s objections to the program, including the cost to working-class motorists.

The official, Emil Bove III, said it was “a standard exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” and that the charges impeded Adams’s ability to aid Trump’s program of mass deportation.</p><p>The judge, Dale Ho, asked for patience as he considers the request to drop the case. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams, said she would wait for the judge to make a decision before determining whether to act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Grant Hindsley for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-537215a9">Microsoft said it created a new state of matter</h2><p>Microsoft is on a mission to make a powerful quantum computer that could accelerate the development of batteries, medicines, artificial intelligence and more.
