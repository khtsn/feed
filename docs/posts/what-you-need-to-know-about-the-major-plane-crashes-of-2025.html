There were no survivors.</p><p>It was the deadliest air crash in the United States in 20 years. In the aftermath, questions emerged about the flight paths of the helicopter and the plane, and whether staffing at Reagan National’s air traffic control contributed to the collision. An investigation is ongoing.</p><h2 id="link-1abc2a79">Medical jet goes down in Philadelphia</h2><p>A small medical plane <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/plane-crash-philadelphia-roosevelt-mall.html" title="">slammed into the ground</a> in northeast Philadelphia a minute after taking off on Jan. 31, bursting into fire and engulfing homes and vehicles in flames. All six people on board, and one person on the ground, were killed, the authorities said.</p><p>The Learjet 55 was transporting a child who had completed treatment in Philadelphia to her home in Mexico. She was accompanied by her mother, and there were also two pilots, a doctor and a paramedic on board, according to Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, which operated the plane.</p><h2 id="link-1837e5a8">Regional plane crashes in remote Alaska</h2><p>A small passenger plane carrying 10 people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/alaska-plane-missing.html" title="">vanished on Feb. 6</a> as it was flying to Nome, Alaska. Its disappearance set off a massive search operation, with Coast Guard and Air Force planes scanning a remote area along the western coast of Alaska.</p><p>The Cessna 208 Caravan was operated by Bering Air, a regional airline. Its wreckage, with the bodies of the pilot and nine passengers, was found the next day.</p><p>Before it crashed, its pilot had told air traffic control that he intended to enter a holding pattern while waiting for the runway in Nome to be cleared, according to the Nome fire department. But Alaska’s Transportation Department said the runway that the plane had been approaching had remained open throughout that day.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
