More than 500 Palestinians have been killed since Israel restarted attacks on Tuesday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>“The more Hamas persists in its refusal, the more territory it will lose,” Mr. Katz said in demanding the release of more hostages.</p><p>He said the Israeli military could expand a security zone inside Gaza where its forces were already stationed and order more Palestinians to evacuate their homes. The captured territory would be held indefinitely by Israel, he added.</p><p>There were no immediate reports of new Israeli attacks with heavy casualties in Gaza on Friday. And mediators were still trying to prevent the new escalation of violence from snowballing back into a full-scale war.</p><p>Hamas said Friday that negotiations to return to the truce — which began in mid-January — were still ongoing. But it reiterated that any agreement to free more hostages would have to lead to a permanent end to the war, which Israel has been loath to commit to while the Palestinian militant group still is in charge of Gaza.</p><p>In Israel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-shin-bet-ronen-bar.html" title="">domestic political turmoil</a> over the war in Gaza intensified this week over a decision by Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, to fire Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet intelligence service. Protesters have criticized Mr. Netanyahu for what they call an attempt to purge the security establishment of those he perceives as disloyal.</p><p>On Friday, Israel’s Supreme Court issued an injunction freezing Mr. Bar’s dismissal until the justices could hear petitions that had been filed against it. The court ruled that the hearing would take place no later than April 8 — two days before the deadline for Mr. Bar’s exit.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s allies quickly denounced the court for intervening as judicial overreach. If the court does strike down the government’s decision to dismiss the Shin Bet chief, the prime minister has yet to say whether he would uphold its ruling.</p><p>Over the past three days, Israeli forces have bombarded targets across Gaza, saying they were attacking Hamas sites and operatives. Israeli ground troops have seized a major corridor in central Gaza from which it withdrew during the cease-fire with Hamas, and they have expanded ground raids in northern and southern Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More than 500 Palestinians have been killed since Israel restarted attacks on Gaza on Tuesday, according to the Gaza health ministry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hamas’s military response so far has been limited. Its military capabilities were significantly degraded by the war, although the group is still believed to command tens of thousands of armed fighters. Israeli officials say Hamas has been using the cease-fire to regroup, plan for future fighting and to plant explosive devices.</p><p>Hamas fired three rockets at Israel for the first time in months, but all were either intercepted or fell without causing casualties, a far cry from the barrages it could muster in the early months of the war.</p><p>Israel hopes to compel Hamas to free more of the remaining hostages seized in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war in Gaza. As many as 24 living captives — and the remains of more than 30 others — are still in Gaza, according to the Israeli government.</p><p>Even before the cease-fire collapsed this week, Israel had blocked humanitarian aid to Gaza, preventing shipments of food and medicine from reaching Palestinians still recovering from more than a year of hunger and wartime deprivation.</p><p>In the latest attacks, Israeli troops have not swept through Palestinian cities in Gaza, divided the enclave in two or forcibly evacuated northern Gaza en masse, as they did during the 15-month campaign against Hamas.</p><p>Israel has vowed not to end the war in Gaza without Hamas’s destruction. Hamas has said it is willing to hand over civilian responsibilities in the enclave, but it has refused to disband its battalions of armed fighters or send its leaders there into exile.</p><p>Diplomats, including from the United States, are hoping to broker at least a partial deal to bring both sides back to the cease-fire, free more hostages and allow humanitarian aid to begin flowing into Gaza again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli soldiers along the northern border with Gaza on Thursday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gil Cohen-Magen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Before the Israeli offensive, Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s Mideast envoy, had proposed an extension of the initial cease-fire, which elapsed in early March, in exchange for the release of hostages.</p><p>In the meantime, the United States and other mediators would work to find a “durable solution to this intractable conflict,” Mr. Witkoff’s office said in a statement last week.</p><p>Israel said it had accepted Mr. Witkoff’s plan, which accorded with Israeli demands for the release of more hostages without an immediate commitment to ending the war in Gaza permanently. Hamas did not immediately agree to the deal, but said earlier this week that it had been considering the proposal.</p><p>In an interview on Thursday in Doha, Qatar, Husam Badran, a senior Hamas official, suggested the group was willing to show some flexibility over such an agreement — including by potentially releasing more hostages — to jump-start talks aimed at ending the war.</p><p>“The problem isn’t the numbers,” Mr. Badran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/middleeast/hamas-attack-tel-aviv-israel-gaza.html" title="">told The New York Times</a>. “We’re acting positively with any proposal that leads to the start of negotiations” over a permanent truce, he added.</p><p>Adam Rasgon<!-- --> and <!-- -->Patrick Kingsley<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
