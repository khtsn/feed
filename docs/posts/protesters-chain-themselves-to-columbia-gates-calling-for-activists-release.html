They were part of a larger contingent that sat down outside the gate.</p><p>The protest followed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/nyregion/columbia-student-palestinian-arrested-ice.html" title="">detention last week of Mohsen Mahdawi</a>, who is finishing undergraduate studies in philosophy at Columbia’s School of General Studies. Mr. Mahdawi was taken into ICE custody during his naturalization appointment in Vermont.</p><p>Federal immigration officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/nyregion/ice-arrests-palestinian-activist-columbia-protests.html" title="">detained Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a graduate of the School of International and Public Affairs, last month. Both were organizers of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia.</p><p>Demonstrators on Monday called for the immediate release of Mr. Mahdawi and Mr. Khalil. They held signs reading, “Free all our political prisoners” and chanted, “We want justice, you say how? Free Mohsen Mahdawi now!” They also read aloud Mr. Khalil’s writings from the detention center in Jena, La., where he is being held.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A Columbia spokesperson said Monday that the university was “monitoring a disruption” and that its public safety officers had cut the locks of about 10 demonstrators.</p><p>“We will follow all applicable policies and procedures for addressing potential violations,” the Columbia spokesperson said. “This small disruption has not impeded the ability of our students to attend classes as normal; all scheduled campus activities have proceeded as planned.”</p><p>The New York Police Department said Monday evening that an unspecified number of people had been taken into custody and were being processed. It was unclear what charges they would face. One of those who was detained had been trying to pitch a tent, the police said.</p><p>It was the second protest this month in which demonstrators attached themselves to Columbia’s gates.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Higher Education in America</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Harvard Under Fire:</strong> President Trump threatened Harvard University’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html">tax-exempt status</a> after the school <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/harvard-trump.html">rebuffed the administration’s demands</a> ostensibly aimed at purging “woke” ideology.
