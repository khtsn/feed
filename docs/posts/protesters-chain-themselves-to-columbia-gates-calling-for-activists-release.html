    <h1>Protesters Chain Themselves to Columbia Gates, Calling for Activists’ Release</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>About 10 demonstrators chained themselves to Columbia University’s campus gates at 116th Street and Amsterdam Avenue in New York on Monday afternoon, protesting the detention of two Palestinian student activists by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. They were part of a larger contingent that sat down outside the gate.</p><p>The protest followed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/nyregion/columbia-student-palestinian-arrested-ice.html" title="">detention last week of Mohsen Mahdawi</a>, who is finishing undergraduate studies in philosophy at Columbia’s School of General Studies. Mr. Mahdawi was taken into ICE custody during his naturalization appointment in Vermont.</p><p>Federal immigration officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/nyregion/ice-arrests-palestinian-activist-columbia-protests.html" title="">detained Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a graduate of the School of International and Public Affairs, last month. Both were organizers of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia.</p><p>Demonstrators on Monday called for the immediate release of Mr. Mahdawi and Mr. Khalil. They held signs reading, “Free all our political prisoners” and chanted, “We want justice, you say how? Free Mohsen Mahdawi now!” They also read aloud Mr. Khalil’s writings from the detention center in Jena, La., where he is being held.</p></div></div>
