Trump has picked to lead the Housing and Urban Development Department, emphasized the need to boost the supply of affordable housing and reduce regulatory barriers during his confirmation hearing on Thursday.</p><p>Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Turner said the agency was “failing at its most basic mission.”</p><p>“We have a housing crisis in our country,&#34; he said. “We need millions of homes.”</p><p>Several Democratic senators grilled Mr. Turner on whether he would oppose efforts to slash federal funding for housing programs, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/business/economy/trump-budget-explained-facts.html" title="">Mr. Trump proposed during his first term</a>. Mr. Turner did not commit to specific actions or voice support for increasing the agency’s funding, but repeatedly said that he would want to maximize “the budget that we do have” and examine the effectiveness of current programs.</p><p>Many of Mr. Turner’s comments aligned with the broader goals that Mr. Trump has laid out for his second term. Mr. Turner said it would be a top priority of his to remove any “burdensome” regulations that were impeding the construction of new homes. He also said he thought it was important for the agency’s employees to work in the office, which would “empower them to serve the American people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If confirmed, Mr. Turner would oversee an agency that provides vouchers and other rental assistance to millions of low-income households, distributes billions to help the homeless and enforces fair housing laws.</p><p>“Scott Turner agreed we have a housing affordability crisis in our country,” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee, said in a statement. “President-elect Trump claims he wants to lower housing costs. But I want to hear more about their plans to actually do that, including investments to boost housing construction, using the department’s tools to bring down costs, and cracking down on private equity and corporate landlords who jack up prices to make a profit.”</p><p>Affordable housing advocates and housing policy experts have expressed mixed thoughts on Mr. Trump’s decision to nominate Mr. Turner. He has been scrutinized in recent weeks over his previous comments about government assistance and his voting record as a state representative in Texas.</p><p>Mr. Turner, a cornerback who played in the N.F.L. for nine seasons, served as a Republican in the Texas House of Representatives from 2013 to 2017. During that time, he supported a bill that would allow landlords to refuse apartments to applicants because they received federal housing assistance, and opposed another that would fund public-private partnerships to support the homeless, a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/scott-turner-hud-nominee-trump-public-housing-texas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProPublica report</a> found. Mr. Turner has also previously <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/scott-turner-hud-nominee-trump-public-housing-texas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called some welfare programs “dangerous.”</a></p><p>“He has consistently opposed meaningful housing policies,” said Renee M. Willis, the interim president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the hearing on Thursday, Mr. Turner said that he was “willing to look at” any programs that help people climb the economic ladder, and that his goal would be to help people “get off of government assistance and to be self-sustainable.” He also said he supported attaching work requirements to housing assistance programs.</p><p>To combat homelessness, Mr. Turner said, it is important for the federal government to work with local communities and faith-based organizations to advance programs that are effective.</p><p>After making a long-shot bid for speaker of the Texas House, Mr. Turner did not seek re-election. He later worked on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/business/biden-trump-opportunity-zones.html" title="">federal initiative</a> to drive investment to economically distressed areas as executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Mr. Trump’s first term.</p><p>Mr. Turner has previously called Ben Carson, the housing secretary in Mr. Trump’s first term, a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_1L7pbIpw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">great mentor</a>.”</p><p>“I’m delighted with the nomination,” Mr. Carson said in an interview. “He worked very well with us when I was the HUD secretary and was the major driver of the opportunity zones.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Most recently, Mr. Turner has been the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottturnerofficial/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chief visionary officer for JPI</a>, a company that develops multifamily properties in Texas and Southern California, and the chairman of the Center for Education Opportunity at the America First Policy Institute, a think tank stocked heavily with former Trump officials. Mr. Turner is also an associate pastor at Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas.</p><p>Some housing experts said Mr. Turner’s experience at a company that builds multifamily housing could mean that he has a strong understanding of the challenges that developers face.</p><p>“Having that lens could be potentially useful as they consider ways to adjust or reform federal regulations,” said David Garcia, the policy director at Up for Growth, a Washington-based research group focused on the housing shortage.</p><p>David M. Dworkin, the president of the National Housing Conference, said he thought Mr. Turner was qualified for the job, and he was enthusiastic about the potential for the incoming administration to take a closer look at regulatory barriers.</p><p>“I think he has exactly the right attitude,” Mr. Dworkin said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Madeleine Ngo covers U.S. economic policy and how it affects people across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/madeleine-ngo">More about Madeleine Ngo</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/housing-and-urban-development-department">Housing and Urban Development Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>TikTok on the Dais: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/tiktok-ceo-trump-inauguration.html">Shou Chew, the chief executive, will join</a> tech moguls <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/trump-tech-inauguration-parties.html">like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk</a> at President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration as the fate of the app hangs in the balance.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.V.
