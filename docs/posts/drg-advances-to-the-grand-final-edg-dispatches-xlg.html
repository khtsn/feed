</span>, who looked to reclaim their place atop CN.</p>



<p>The first series of the day was the upper final match, where DRG was able to continue their playoff run by taking down BLG. The match was extremely competitive throughout, but DRG managed to take a 2-1 victory to advance to the grand final for the first time in their history. They will guarantee a top two seed going into Champions, which is crucially important for them as an Ascension team. Since they are competing with XLG to retain their spot in the league, placing higher than them in Stage 2 gives them the tie-breaker advantage in the event that they end Champions in the same position.</p>

<p>The match started on BLG&#39;s map pick of Haven, but it was DRG that was able to get the first round on the board. They rode the momentum from the pistol to a 4-1 lead before BLG could get settled into the map. Once they did, however, they quickly took the lead back, shutting down DRG&#39;s site hits to end the half up 7-5.</p>

<p>In the second half, DRG won their second pistol round of the map. BLG made the bold decision to force buy into the second round, a choice that didn&#39;t end up paying off, and instead let DRG take the lead right back. They traded a few rounds back and forth, but ultimately DRG&#39;s defense outmatched BLG. Their aggressive style took fights to their opponents before they could get situated around the map, a common thread seen throughout the whole series. The success of this defensive strategy let DRG win map one 13-10.</p>

<p>Next up was DRG&#39;s map pick of Lotus, where they previously took down both EDG and XLG in 14-12 overtime wins. BLG proved a more challenging foe, with two pistol wins making victory difficult for DRG. It didn&#39;t help that they opted into a force buy of their own on round two which they lost, putting them on the immediate backfoot. They kept up in the first half, but BLG&#39;s site holds let them again take a 7-5 lead at the half.</p>

<p>Their second pistol took BLG up to 9-5, but DRG&#39;s defensive aggression let them tie it up at nine rounds apiece. BLG managed a round to retake the lead, and what followed was a blunder from DRG. In a 2v3 situation with worse weapons, they opted to invest both a Yoru and Breach ultimate into the round, which they promptly lost, leaving them without their strongest tools for the next rounds. In said next rounds, <span data-ref-id="5">

<p><em>nephh clutches with a Shorty to win BLG Lotus.</em></p>

<p>On the final map of Sunset, BLG once again had the luxury of winning both pistol rounds. The first one let them get a quick 4-0 lead, but outside of this start, it was DRG that dominated the map. BLG&#39;s second pistol win let them start the half 8-5, but DRG won the following eco, and proceeded to wreak havoc on the attack side. They won seven straight attack rounds, plowing through BLG&#39;s site holds, getting up to match point. BLG adapted by switching to playing for retakes, which, aided by heavy fragging from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4885/whzy">

They quickly dispatched of XLG today in a 2-0 victory, going on to face BLG in the lower final. For XLG this loss secures them as the fourth seed going into Champions, meaning that they will have to place higher than DRG in order to avoid being sent down to Ascension.</p>

<p>The match started on XLG&#39;s pick of Lotus, a map where they had just <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527586/xi-lai-gaming-vs-all-gamers-vct-2025-china-stage-2-lr2/?game=230586&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">thrashed</a> <span data-ref-id="11">

</span> on in their Champions qualifying win. It started off evenly matched, with EDG winning the pistol, but XLG quickly equalizing. The teams were drawn at 4-4, but EDG broke away with the half. They took the last four rounds of the half as their own, capped off by a 1v2 from <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span>.</p>


<p><em>EDG&#39;s new captain is still as clutch as ever.</em></p>

<p>Again winning the pistol in the second half, as well as the bonus, EDG effortlessly brought about match point, with eight rounds to close out the map. However, with XLG now on the attack side, they finally started to come alive. Despite running a triple Sentinel comp, XLG&#39;s attack side was their strong suit, having found 11 rounds on it in their match a day prior. After hitting match point, EDG took their foot off the pedal, and XLG showed their prowess. One by one, the rounds started slipping away from EDG, until they were only faced with one more chance to prevent overtime. However, at the final hurdle, it was XLG that couldn&#39;t quite complete the comeback, as they were halted at the entrance to A site, and EDG breathed a sigh of relief as they closed out the map 13-11.</p>

<p>Now going to their map pick of Corrode, EDG ensured not to repeat the same mistakes they did on Lotus. In a similarly dominant fashion as the first half of Lotus, they completely dispatched XLG, despite losing both pistol rounds. They circumvented their pistol losses by managing to pull off eco rounds right after each one, armed with nothing but pistols. Outside of those rounds, it was Jieni7 and KangKang lighting up the server on Neon and Yoru respectively. EDG easily took the map in a 13-5 win, and will continue on in the bracket to fight to reclaim their crown atop VCT CN.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will feature the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527588/bilibili-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2025-china-stage-2-lbf" target="_blank">lower bracket final</a> match between Bilibili Gaming and EDward Gaming to decide who will face Dragon Ranger Gaming in the grand final.</p>
