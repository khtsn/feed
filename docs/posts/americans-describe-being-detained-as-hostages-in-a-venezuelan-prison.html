This was key to Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/us/politics/trump-venezuelans-deportations-el-salvador.html" title="">ambitions to deport</a> millions of migrants. </p><p>Guards led Mr. Werber, Mr. Guillaume, Mr. Estrella and three others to a car. Mr. Guillaume could see the Caribbean coastline as they descended to the airport.</p><p>But it wasn’t until he was on the plane that he believed he was going home, he said.</p><p>In the air the men got a call from Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><p>Afterward, Mr. Estrella called the president “awesome,” and said he was grateful the administration had made their release a priority. But he was perplexed by the limited assistance he got upon arrival — he lost 40 pounds during detention, he said, and came home with serious nerve and back problems.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>The night of their release, the men were left at a hotel “and that’s it,” he said. No medical exam beyond a vitals check. No visit from a psychologist. No invitation to a government rehabilitation program — something typically offered to returning prisoners.</p><p>It wasn’t until March that the men began getting calls from the State Department, they said, telling them Mr. Rubio had declared them “wrongfully detained,” a label that triggers years of access to help. </p><p>The State Department spokesman said the government was in touch with the returnees and seeking to provide them with additional support.</p><p>Six weeks after his release, Mr. Guillaume is living in Colombia, staying with the family of his fiancée, Ms. Barradas, while she is locked up.</p><p>She is among at least a dozen Venezuelans arrested alongside the Americans — their girlfriends, wives and in-laws. The American returnees believe they are all still in prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>Mr. Guillaume said the detention of his girlfriend haunts him, making him feel “dishonorable.”</p><p>He is free but she is not, he said, and so his heart and happiness are still trapped in Venezuela.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The family of Mr. Guillaume’s fiancée, Jaralmy Barradas, including her mother, Wendy Espinoza, and two brothers, Jean and Dioner.
