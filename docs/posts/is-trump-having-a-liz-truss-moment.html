So far, Mr. Trump has vowed to stick with his tariffs, no matter the carnage they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/business/stocks-trump-tariffs.html" title="">wreak in the markets</a> or whether they trigger a recession, and there seems to be little anybody can do to force him to change course.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Truss could really only damage the United Kingdom,” said Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at Kings College London. “Ultimately, U.K. institutions, in particular Parliament and the media, were enough to ensure that the system worked.”</p><p>“Whether that is the case in the U.S. remains to be seen,” he added. “If it isn’t, the whole world will pay the price.”</p><p>Britain, which Mr. Trump hit with a tariff of 10 percent, is already acting like a country on the brink of crisis. In a bid to shore up the British auto industry, the current prime minister, Keir Starmer, announced he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/britain-electric-vehicles-auto-tariffs.html" title="">relax rules for luxury carmakers</a> like Aston-Martin and McLaren requiring them to phase out gasoline and diesel-powered cars by 2030.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Jaguar Land Rover factory in Birmingham on Monday.

And like him, she was an outlier.</p><p>Her tax cuts, which she had planned to fund by increasing borrowing, were viewed skeptically by economists. She was proposing an inflationary policy at a moment when Britain and other countries were battling rising energy prices and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/business/britain-inflation.html" title="">cost-of-living crisis</a>. And she declined to submit her plans to scrutiny by the government’s fiscal watchdog, the Office of Budget Responsibility.</p><p>The markets responded by torpedoing shares of British companies and pushing the pound down to near parity with the American dollar. The International Monetary Fund warned of Britain’s financial instability.</p><p>As a smaller economy, Britain was more vulnerable to these gyrations than the United States. Yields on government bonds spiked under Ms. Truss, stoking fears of a credit crisis and ultimately leading to her downfall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Yields on Treasury bills declined even as Mr. Trump’s tariffs were rolling out, reflecting the United States’ traditional status as a haven for investors and protecting the president from some of the pressure faced by Ms. Truss. Though on Monday, they, too, began to rise.</p><p>Within days, Ms. Truss withdrew the tax cuts and dismissed her chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, a key architect of the supply-side policy. The Bank of England intervened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/business/economy/bank-of-england-bonds.html" title="">prop up British bonds</a> and the market turmoil subsided. But Ms. Truss’s credibility was shattered. After senior members of her party told her she had lost their faith, she handed in her resignation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Liz Truss with Kwasi Kwarteng, her chancellor of the Exchequer, in October 2022, the same month she fired him and later resigned herself.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stefan Rousseau/Press Association, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Like Truss, the market reaction is not just driven by the actual policy changes, damaging as they were in both cases, but by their attempt to destroy the institutions that normally constrain policy,” Professor Portes said.</p><p>For all of Ms. Truss’s missteps, some economists argue that her tax cuts could be considered less radical than Mr. Trump’s tariffs. In a different fiscal environment, her supply-side agenda would have been relatively conventional for a right-of-center government. But in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/business/uk-energy-price-cap.html" title="">stoked inflation</a> and led the central bank to raise borrowing costs rapidly, the tax cuts were badly timed and poorly communicated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The biggest similarity is a crisis of competence,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. “Liz Truss’s policies may have made sense in some other world. But they just came out of the blue, so they didn’t have any credibility.”</p><p>Professor Rogoff said Mr. Trump’s tariffs had even less credibility among economists, not least because they seem disconnected from any strategy. “Trump has not articulated where we’re going,” he said, “and it’s hard to find anyone who’s not a paid publicist for him who thinks this is a good idea.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
