But rarely is the contrast starker than in his approach to American leadership in the world.</p><p>While those Republicans sometimes spoke of global alliances in terms of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/20/us/white-house-letter-axis-of-evil-first-birthday-for-a-famous-phrase.html" title="">good and evil</a>, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-diplomacy.html" title="">joined with</a> America’s adversaries to oppose a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/middleeast/us-un-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">United Nations resolution</a> condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-zelensky-ukraine-comments.html" title="">falsely</a> suggested that Ukraine had started the war.

Nicholas Burns, a former <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/what-america-gets-out-of-nato.html" title="">ambassador to NATO</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/business/nicholas-burns-ambassador-china.html" title="">China</a>. “Every president until now adhered to democratic principles and values, including the idea that America should be the standard-bearer for democracy around the world, to uphold the rule of law and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country.”</p><p>Here’s a snapshot of how Mr. Trump’s moves on the global stage have alarmed an ideologically diverse range of critics, left other Americans deeply torn and delighted his supporters.</p><h2 id="link-59402213">The disillusioned idealists</h2><p>The Oval Office dressing-down of Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/europe/trump-putin-russia-europe.html" title="">shocked America’s allies abroad</a>. But it was especially distressing to some people in Pennsylvania.</p><p>The state is home to one of the nation’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/07/more-than-one-million-americans-report-ukrainian-ancestry.html#:~:text=population%20was%201%2C015%2C209.-,Where%20They%20Live,in%20Ukraine%20(Figure%203)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largest populations</a> of people of Ukrainian ancestry, and Mr. Zelensky visited an ammunition factory in Scranton last fall, where he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/us/politics/trump-ukraine-vance-zelensky.html" title="">thanked workers</a> for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/us/ukraine-church-war-scranton.html" title="">manufacturing artillery shells</a> to support Ukraine. Vice President JD Vance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/28/us/trump-news#zelensky-vance-ukraine-pennsylvania" title="">mischaracterized</a> that trip as a campaign stop as he berated Mr. Zelensky at the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In Scranton, some recoiled, said Mayor Paige Gebhardt Cognetti, a Democrat who noted that City Hall <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mayorpaigecognetti/p/DGeBN13t-XH/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has displayed the Ukrainian flag</a>.</p><p>“It’s really a personal affront here in Scranton, the idea that the American government would turn its back on Ukraine, and really turn its back on Europe,” she said.</p><p>She warned against taking American global strength for granted.</p><p>“I worry that the Trump administration, maybe some of the Americans who support this current administration, think that America, well, ‘we’ve always been so strong,’” she said. “They’re really playing with fire.”</p><p>Two hours south of Scranton, Karen Curry, 65, was having lunch at the Eagle Diner in Warminster, Pa., in politically competitive Bucks County. Ms. Curry, who said she voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but backed former Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, said the Trump administration was threatening America’s standing.</p><p>“My whole life, I felt like we were the leaders of the free world, that America was the moral compass,” said Ms. Curry, who said she was a registered Republican. “Now, we have a transactional president who’s more interested in padding his own pockets and his legacy, and really likes powerful dictators. If we continue down this path, I don’t think we’re going to be the leaders of the free world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The concerns go beyond issues of war and peace.</p><p>In Columbia, S.C., Mayor Daniel Rickenmann, a Republican, said he understood the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-president-promises.html" title="">emphasis on</a> promoting manufacturing in the United States. </p><p>“At the same time, we can’t isolate ourselves from the rest of the world,” he said, speaking in particular of trade policy. “I’m worried about that.”</p><p>Many Americans across the political spectrum have long been idealistic about the United States’ role as a global power, viewing the nation as a force for good and a champion of democracy, even if the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/16/world/secrets-history-cia-iran-special-report-plot-convulsed-iran-53-79.html" title="">historical record</a> is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/americas/chile-coup-cia-museum.html" title="">far more complex</a>.</p><p>Kristin Ortlieb, 51, of Buckingham, Pa., said she had always viewed America as a global leader with obligations to provide aid and work to advance “the greater good.”</p><p>“With Trump in office, in my view, we have lost that vision and that leadership,” she said. “If you look at leaders in other parts of the world, they have long memories, and they will remember when the U.S. abandoned them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Recent polling suggests that Americans <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2025-03/Reuters%20Ipsos%20Pre%20Joint%20Session%20Congress%20Topline%2003%2004%202025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely disagree</a> with Mr. Trump’s claim that Ukraine is the aggressor in its war with Russia, and are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-elon-musk-government-workforce-cuts-opinion-poll-2025-03-02/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more inclined</a> to sympathize with Ukraine than Russia.</p><h2 id="link-7f9d3699">The people reserving judgment</h2><p>Mr. Trump won the election last year in part because he successfully cast himself — again — as a change agent.</p><p>And some Americans, even a few who backed Ms. Harris, say they are keeping an open mind about his norm-shattering approach at a time of protracted conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p><p>Alan Almonte, 34, a manager at a consulting firm in Philadelphia, said he was a political independent who voted for Ms. Harris, and worried about what he saw as Mr. Trump’s “bullying” tactics. But, he said, “the old methods are not working.”</p><p>“It’s unconventional,” he said, though he continued, “The way we’re doing things, I don’t feel is getting things done.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>State Representative Keith Harris, a Democrat from Philadelphia, said Mr. Zelensky “did deserve some respect.” But he agreed with Mr. Trump’s emphasis on ending the war.</p><p>“That’s one thing Trump may be right about,” he said. Mr. Zelensky, he added, “can’t keep asking for money when he can’t win.”</p><p>On Capitol Hill, Representative Mike Lawler, a New York Republican from a competitive district and a <a href="https://lawler.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3811" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vocal supporter of Ukraine</a>, said “we can agree or disagree at times on rhetoric.”</p><p>But he argued that to reach a settlement between Russia and Ukraine, “you actually have to get both parties to the table, which requires engaging those with which we disagree,” adding, “And in this case, it would be Russia.”</p><p>U.S. officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/middleeast/us-hamas-hostage-talks-gaza.html" title="">also had talks</a> with Hamas officials about Israeli American hostages taken to Gaza, and Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-talks.html" title="">has raised</a> the possibility of reopening negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“He’s strong enough to talk to adversaries or look them in the eye and make clear what America will stand for,” said Brian Hughes, a National Security Council spokesman. “President Trump’s approach is, there’s no greater force for peace and stability in the world than a strong American homeland.”</p><p>Asked about the view, widely held by his critics, that Mr. Trump is overly susceptible to flattery, Mr. Hughes replied, “I don’t believe any adversary anywhere in the world believes that flattery will diminish his exercise of America’s strength.”</p><h2 id="link-6baa0209">The supporters who like the tough talk</h2><p>Last week, Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/elissa-slotkin-trump-speech-response.html" title="">delivered the Democrats’ response</a> to Mr. Trump’s address to Congress — and in many ways, she sounded more like a traditional Republican than he did.</p><p>“Trump would have lost us the Cold War,” she said from Wyandotte, Mich., arguing that his actions “suggest that, in his heart, he doesn’t believe we’re an exceptional nation.”</p><p>But on the ground in working-class Wyandotte, some voters argued that Mr. Trump’s combative approach to the world was what the country needed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Carrying a box of meat as he left a Polish butcher shop, Jeff Zarenski, 59, a millwright from nearby Brownstown, said approvingly that the United States was “turning more into the bully.”</p><p>“Some people are getting pissed off at us,” said Mr. Zarenski, a Trump supporter. “I like it. It’s a show of strength.”</p><p>In affluent Brookhaven, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, Willie Candler, 28, a real estate agent and a self-described center-right Republican, was milder in tone, but said he, too, supported Mr. Trump’s foreign policy.</p><p>“It can be kind of in your face, or ruffle some feathers,” he said. “I’ve got a different style for the way I approach sales.
