For nearly two decades, she has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/nyregion/eric-adams-advisers.html" title="">part of Mr. Adams’s inner circle</a> as he rose through New York City politics. Ms. Lewis-Martin became known as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-adams.html" title="">fiercely loyal lieutenant</a>, negotiating political deals and fending off threats from opponents.</p><p>In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Adams said Ms. Lewis-Martin “has not been just a friend, a confidante and trusted adviser, but also a sister.”</p><p>He continued: “We’ve always talked about when this day would come, and while we’ve long planned for it, it is still hard to know that Ingrid won’t be right next door every day. I, and every New Yorker, owe her a debt of gratitude for her decades of service to our city.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a statement, Ms. Lewis-Martin said she was retiring to spend more time with her family, and called the mayor her “political partner, brother and friend.”</p><p>Addressing the mayor, she said: “I extend humble gratitude to you for encouraging me to be my authentic self and for having my back during some trying times. As you would say, this has been a good ride; I will use author’s license and say that this has been an amazing ride.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin’s last day was Sunday, the mayor’s office said. Her departure was first reported by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/15/ingrid-lewis-martin-eric-adams-aide-resigns-00194411" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Politico</a>.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin and Mr. Adams met in 1984, they have said, through her husband, Glenn Martin, a friend of Mr. Adams’s at the police academy. When Mr. Adams decided to run for the State Senate in 2006, he asked her to serve as campaign manager.</p><p>After he became Brooklyn borough president in 2014, Ms. Lewis-Martin, his deputy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-adams.html" title="">pushed the limits of ethics rules</a>, City Hall aides told The New York Times last year.</p><p>In one instance, when two restaurateurs who supported Mr. Adams received a water lien, she asked her staff to contact the Department of Environmental Protection to resolve the issue. When she led a nonprofit, the One Brooklyn Fund, that Mr. Adams used to promote himself and the borough, colleagues said she asked real estate firms that had business with the borough president’s office to donate, a possible conflict of interest.</p><p>In 2021, Ms. Lewis-Martin joined Mr. Adams’s mayoral campaign. She was particularly close with Brianna Suggs, the mayor’s former chief fund-raiser, and Winnie Greco, his former director of Asian affairs — both of whom had their homes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/nyregion/fbi-adams-greco-investigation-nyc.html" title="">raided by the F.B.I.</a> as part of separate federal investigations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After Mr. Adams was elected, several of his supporters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-adams.html" title="">urged him not to bring Ms. Lewis-Martin to City Hall.</a> But Mr. Adams hired her as his chief adviser in January 2022, and she has since been involved in some of his most scrutinized public statements, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/nyregion/eric-adams-religion-church.html" title="">his dismissal of the separation</a> of church and state and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/20/us/politics/eric-adams-biden-democrats.html" title="">criticism of President Biden</a> over an influx of migrants to the city.</p><p>She was unapologetic about her confrontational style. “I’m not Michelle Obama,” she once <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/personality/2022/12/ingrid-lewis-martin-nycs-higher-power/380425/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told City and State</a>. “When they go low? We drill for oil.”</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin fought against bike lanes and the Open Streets program, and pushed the mayor to cut back a plan to remove car lanes from a section of McGuinness Boulevard in Brooklyn, which was ultimately restored.</p><p>During her tenure, she frustrated staff members and angered other officials by overriding them on even the most minor issues, aides told The Times last year. They said that Ms. Lewis-Martin was bitter rivals with Sheena Wright, Mr. Adams’s former first deputy mayor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/nyregion/sheena-wright-resigns-eric-adams.html" title="">who resigned in October</a> after her phone was also seized by federal agents.</p><p>Still, Mr. Adams kept her close. When <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/06/12/texts-show-how-nyc-mayor-adams-tried-to-pacify-bling-bishop-lamor-whitehead-in-feud-with-top-adviser/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">texts surfaced in June</a> showing that Mr. Adams said in 2018 that Ms. Lewis-Martin had “anger management issues,” the mayor was conciliatory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Ingrid and I have been together for over 30 years,” he said. “We’re siblings, and no article is going to rip us apart. People have tried that for years. We stood side by side throughout this entire journey, and we’re going to continue to do so.”</p><p>Three months later, after her home was raided, Ms. Lewis-Martin denied wrongdoing.</p><p>“I don’t know anything,” she said on a radio show hosted by her lawyer, Arthur L. Aidala. “I’ve done nothing. And I don’t think that there is anything to know.”</p><p>Later, apparently referring to herself and the mayor, she said that no one is perfect, “but we are not thieves.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
