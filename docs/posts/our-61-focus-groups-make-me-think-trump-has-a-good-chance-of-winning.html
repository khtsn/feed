The pandemic felled Mr. Trump in 2020, bringing out the true autocrat for all to see on Jan. 6, 2021, and fueled his hunger for the second term he felt he was owed. Covid shaped the economy that Mr. Biden tried to revive through policies that proved inflationary. The shocks and aftershocks of the lockdowns and closures set many of our focus group participants on harder paths in life, from schoolchildren to college students to workers to the elderly.</p><p>Covid changed and scarred America. Desperation set in for people who thought of themselves as financially stable or middle class. The frustration we heard in our early focus groups in 2022 metastasized into anxiety in 2023 and intensified into anger in 2024. Listening to them, I stopped seeing anxiety and anger as two distinct emotions. They were one and the same by the time the presidential general election began this year.</p><p>So many people talked about their lives before and after Covid that it influenced how I saw Mr. Trump’s chances and Mr. Biden’s challenges in this election (and how those challenges, inevitably, shifted onto Ms. Harris).</p><p>A main takeaway from our groups is that a cross-section of independents, Republicans and Democrats liked how America was under Mr. Trump — they liked the economy, the perception of relative global stability, the restraint of divided government and the image that this outsider businessman was not beholden to Washington insiders, lobbyists and big money (the unholy trio of turpitude for many of our participants). There were plenty of things that they didn’t like about Mr. Trump — his behavior and tweets most of all — but those didn’t matter as much. Then Covid happened and Americans wanted a more stable leader. Listening to all of these voters over the years, I can’t help but feel that Mr. Trump probably would have been re-elected in 2020 if not for Covid. And his refusal to concede the 2020 election and his behavior on Jan. 6 turned our focus group participants against him more than anything else he did. Perhaps that will be enough to defeat him this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As for Mr. Biden’s challenges, one of the signal failures of his administration has been telling Americans that the economy was getting better and better. They kept telling us: Not for me. Americans hate inflation, full stop. If there was a common denominator for our groups across 2022, 2023 and 2024, it was experiencing and loathing inflation, such that I see it as the single most important fact of life in Tuesday’s election. That can’t be overstated.</p><h2 id="link-772147f0">Voters hate inflation, and they preferred the economy under Trump.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="superfocusgroups-quote-6" data-id="100000009792591" data-source-id="100000009792591"><div slug="superfocusgroups-quote-6" data-sourceid="100000009792591" id="embed-id-100000009792591">

And I was supposed to get an M.R.I. to help determine where my symptoms are coming from. But I couldn’t because my co-pay would have been too much. So something that is damaging my body, that is causing me pain, I can’t get to the bottom of it because I can’t afford to have it looked into.</p></blockquote><p>Yana, 44, Georgia, 2022</p><blockquote><p>The cost of housing, the cost of groceries. As a teacher, almost everyone I know has a side hustle right now.</p></blockquote><p>Andres, 41, Florida, 2023</p><blockquote><p>You hear these reports that things are improving, but then you do your own assessment of your own grocery bills and utilities and just day-to-day sort of things that you need to get by. It feels like things are still not coming down.</p></blockquote><p>Khaled, 50, Pennsylvania, 2024</p><blockquote><p>I come from a big family, and I’m the breadwinner. I feel every single penny when I go to the market and when I gas up my car. Things aren’t as cheap as they used to be.</p></blockquote><p>Whether the economy sinks Ms. Harris’s election chances on Tuesday is an open question: Women are turning her way, including some who told us that they voted for Mr. Trump in 2020. Some swing-state Republican women who are pro-Trump said that they saw some traits in Ms. Harris that they respected, citing “fortitude,” “confidence,” “compassion” and determination. If this presidential campaign from the get-go had been Mr. Trump versus Ms. Harris — had she been running for two years, not for three months — she would probably be in a better position with a good share of our independents and Nikki Haley Republicans. A lot of them have started to warm to her; it reminds me of my colleague David Brooks’s recent column about how this election is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/opinion/polarization-harris-change.html" title="">happening too soon</a> for Ms. Harris.</p><p>In other words, a clear takeaway from our groups is that the two biggest reasons Ms. Harris may lose on Tuesday are the economy and Joe Biden insisting on running for re-election.</p><p>If these groups began in 2022 with some hope that President Biden would get the economy in shape and confront and solve cost-of-living problems, they ended with participants expressing dismay and disappointment over his presidency. Even Democratic focus groups told us recently that no one missed him in the race. Mr. Biden’s misreading of the electorate — and the unconvincing story his team told themselves about the economy — is striking in hindsight, as is his hubris that he had the communication gifts necessary to convince the country that he felt their pain and that things were getting better. Bill Clinton must have been silently aghast for years now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-7c0a50a5">Americans want change.

I’m very disappointed in Biden, and I voted for him. I had high hopes. Biden made a lot of promises, and he hasn’t delivered on a lot.</p></blockquote><p>Fredrick, 36, North Carolina, 2024</p><blockquote><p>As much as Biden has done with the infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, I believe that more could have been done, and he didn’t fight for those things that were in the Build Back Better legislation.</p></blockquote><p>Jessica, 19, New Jersey, 2024</p><blockquote><p>I would be more likely to vote for a Democratic candidate that was not 80-plus years old.</p></blockquote><p>Uche, 25, Pennsylvania, 2024</p><blockquote><p>I don’t want to vote for Trump [again]. I feel better voting for Kamala than for Biden. Biden’s really old. And it didn’t seem like he had the energy.</p></blockquote><p>The desire for change was palpable in our focus groups leading up to the 2022 midterm election. Yet some of them, with voters in Arizona and Georgia who had important Senate races on the ballot, showed deep skepticism about the Republican candidates and their abilities. In our 2024 groups, by contrast, the enthusiasm among many Republicans and some independents for Mr. Trump — or, at least, in Mr. Trump’s ability to make the economy better — has been much more intense and constant.</p><p>Maybe Democratic leaders never appreciated the depth of hurt or hunger for change. But I doubt it: Democratic voters in our groups were giving up on Mr. Biden as early as 2022, and his approval ratings were deeply underwater by then. It looks, instead, as if party leaders and Biden aides committed textbook political malpractice by circling the wagons around a diminished incumbent president to clear the way for him to run for re-election, sandbagging his vice president and other Democrats from running a full-out race.</p><p>There’s something else that the Democrats have misread, something that voters across a range of backgrounds brought up since we began talking to them. Either on Tuesday or some other point in the future, the party is in for a rude awakening over illegal immigration.</p><p>Think about it this way: People in our groups are upset about their cost of groceries or rent or health care, about their inability to keep their head above water — let alone to get ahead or have a life better than their parents. Some of them don’t see the America of their youth anymore and a lot of them think its best days are in the past (a staggering thing to say given the history of American slavery, violence and inequality). And they see government support going to help migrants, with little being done to seal the border. For some of our focus group participants, illegal immigration is both a threat to the security of the country and a proxy for the political upheaval, economic difficulty and social and demographic change that they have felt. Others blamed Mr. Trump for scuttling a bipartisan immigration bill this year, but the bulk of frustration fell on Mr. Biden and his party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p><h2 id="link-2843ab2a">Democrats could face a reckoning on immigration and the border.</h2></p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-15"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="superfocusgroups-quote-4" data-id="100000009792593" data-source-id="100000009792593"><div slug="superfocusgroups-quote-4" data-sourceid="100000009792593" id="embed-id-100000009792593">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Paul, 44, Arizona, 2022</p><blockquote><p>Biden is purposely keeping the border wide open, and that’s causing a ton of problems for us.</p></blockquote><p>Donnia, 62, Illinois, 2023</p><blockquote><p>I’m disappointed about the border. I’m originally from Texas, and I’m not saying, “Build the wall.” That was ridiculous. But I do think that the border issue is something that is going to affect us. Here in Illinois and Chicago, they’ve been busing a lot of immigrants — or refugees, I can call them, because they’re fleeing something — to this area. I don’t know that we’re getting any help, and it’s depleting a lot of our resources.</p></blockquote><p>Kathy, 67, Arizona, 2024</p><blockquote><p>Not too long ago on the news, there was footage of a hole in the fence in the Mexico border, and literally droves of people coming through, probably dressed a little nicer than I am right now. And no one stopped them. And they were trespassing across a farmer’s land. And when he called the police and the Border Patrol, they showed up, but they didn’t do a thing. So to me, that’s tantamount to “It’s free here. Come on over. We’ll give you food stamps. We’ll give you a place to live.”</p></blockquote><p>Pierce, 26, North Carolina, 2024</p><blockquote><p>We could talk about women’s health care all day. We could talk about safety. We can talk about the economy. But at the end of the day, thousands of immigrants are here who have committed crimes against people. We’re living in a fantasy land where Kamala Harris is not responsible for that open border. It’s almost treasonous.</p></blockquote><p>What I’ve heard has left me thinking that Democratic Party leaders have deeply underestimated the mood of the electorate on immigration — that more people than Democrats realize want something serious, even draconian, done to remove undocumented migrants and secure the border. If it takes an authoritarian Trump administration to do it, then so be it, some of these voters feel. The degree of their anger can be unsettling to contemplate.</p><p>All of this adds up to a pretty hard truth about America: A majority of voters have said that the country is on the wrong track for almost 20 years now, and listening to our focus groups, you sometimes get the chilling sense that sooner or later, the country is going to crack. Not crack apart — that’s not it — but the swings in our intense politics will keep going so hard and so far that something will have to give.</p><p>That could look like Mr. Trump getting re-elected this week and, using any means he can, perhaps <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/22/trump-mass-deportation-immigrant-camps" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including the military</a>, rounding up undocumented immigrants, putting them in militarized camps and deporting them, with more Americans than you would think going along with it. Such a move would devastate our sense of America as a sanctuary, erode our norms, fracture the tacit acceptance that immigrants do a lot of jobs that many Americans don’t want to do. It would redefine us as a society.</p><p>Among many of our voters, there was a clear desire for a strong leader who takes charge of the country and puts it on a better course. Many of them saw Mr. Trump as able to deliver that change.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>And yet. You can’t overstate the anger and disgust — including among many Republicans — for Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede the 2020 election; his attempts to strong-arm Republicans to overturn the results or stop the certification of the votes; and his incitement of the rioters who attacked the Capitol that Jan. 6. While many of our participants said they thought Mr. Trump would have a positive impact on the economy and immigration, there was deep reluctance among some of those who voted for him in 2020 or 2016 to reward him with the presidency again following his conduct after the last election. While some people want Mr. Trump’s pre-Covid economy again, a lot of voters don’t want to risk their future and their families’ well-being on how he might behave again in the Oval Office.</p><h2 id="link-188364cf">Trump’s behavior and Jan. 6 could sink him.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-19"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="superfocusgroups-quote-3" data-id="100000009792594" data-source-id="100000009792594"><div slug="superfocusgroups-quote-3" data-sourceid="100000009792594" id="embed-id-100000009792594">

People got hurt, they lost their lives. And a responsible person, let alone the leader of a free country — there had to have been a better way to speak his mind without instigating so much violence.</p></blockquote><p>Andrea, 49, New Jersey, 2023</p><blockquote><p>The gas prices were low. The border was under control. Everything was just great. And he got run out of town just because he sends mean tweets and has a big mouth. They’d rather elect a nice guy and have the country in the toilet.</p></blockquote><p>Chris, 24, Florida, 2024</p><blockquote><p>Donald Trump betrayed his oath of office after the 2020 election. He has no business being around power ever again based on his actions leading up to Jan. 6, on Jan. 6, and his actions and rhetoric afterwards. Frankly, I would borderline call him a traitor to this country for putting together a scheme to overturn what his own administration officials said was a free and fair election.</p></blockquote><p>Miranda, 26, Wisconsin, 2024</p><blockquote><p>I think Trump’s good for the economy, truthfully. But I don’t agree with his behavior. He kind of scares me a little bit. I’m still undecided.</p></blockquote><p>You can probably tell that these groups have left me thinking that Mr. Trump has a good chance of winning on Tuesday. It’s hard not to think so. Perhaps that’s because focus group participants, given the chance to talk, tend to share their worries and frustrations more than their hopes.</p><p>And during an administration that has seen historic inflation, this means that many people are hungry for change; that they feel the country is on the wrong track; and, for some, that they don’t really recognize America right now.</p><p>Some of our focus group participants saw lawlessness and a breakdown of social order in their neighborhoods and cities during the peaks of Covid but also afterward. Some said they voted for Mr. Biden because they thought he was a moderate who would take steps to unify the country, but ultimately saw little evidence of that. Some of them, and many Republicans, described Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris as too progressive in their policies and values and too inclined to demonize MAGA members and others who don’t think like liberals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p><h2 id="link-3582b8dd">What country is this?</h2></p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-23"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="superfocusgroups-quote-2" data-id="100000009792595" data-source-id="100000009792595"><div slug="superfocusgroups-quote-2" data-sourceid="100000009792595" id="embed-id-100000009792595">

And a lot of them don’t have jobs. It’s the woman who is the main breadwinner, and they just — I think men are getting lazy or something.</p></blockquote><p>Christopher, from a 2023 focus group of police officers</p><blockquote><p>People see on TV that you can go into a Walgreens and just take what you want. There’s no consequence to any of your actions, and that speaks volumes. I mean, growing up, I was scared to get in trouble. I was scared to do anything wrong, for the fear of getting in trouble with the police or, more so, my parents.</p></blockquote><p>Elaine, 83, Massachusetts, 2023</p><blockquote><p>I hope there’s going to be more kindness, people getting along. Right now, it’s just not good at all. We need more time, more love. Money’s not the answer to everything.</p></blockquote><p>Katelyn, 29, Georgia, 2024</p><blockquote><p>If you look at the ratios of yearly income to average housing cost, I don’t think affordability is going to come back. The school shootings, teen-on-teen violence, global warming. I think we’ve set off a runaway train that we won’t be able to pull back.</p></blockquote><p>The idea of being uncomfortable in America was at the heart of two focus groups that drew unusually large and deep readership. One was a group of conservative men; the other was a group of transgender Americans. There were many differences between those two groups, but what united them was a desire to feel as if they could be themselves in America, open and proud about who they are, without being criticized or ostracized by other people. Freedom of speech, freedom to think, freedom to be who you are, freedom to be left alone — those values were deeply important to the trans Americans and to the conservative men, and to the women we heard from in our two focus groups on abortion rights, and the older Americans who asked one another, what happened to my country?</p><p>Many voters are asking versions of that question in this election — and will surely be asking it after Tuesday. No matter the outcome, I’ll be thinking about a sentiment that came up often in our conversations. A young Florida woman named Alissa put it succinctly in 2023:</p><p>“We’re all in it together.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-25"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Adrian J.
