<p>This will be the first time that Vietnam&#39;s largest and most populous city will host an International Leagues event, since it has hosted other VCT events before, like the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2084/challengers-league-2024-vietnam-split-2" target="_blank">2024 Challengers Vietnam Split 2 Finals</a> which saw <span data-ref-id="0">

	<p>Realistically Mumbai should get some recognition</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="6036844" id="2">

	
	
	<p>yeah, the GE watch-parties in Mumbai are always packed.</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="6036845" id="3">

	
	
	<p>do you still tune in for GE games now that they have no Indian representation?</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="6036857" id="11">

	
	
	<p>Most actual GE fans, dont care, GE has an academy team, they also work with ROG on the ROG academy team to foster Indian talent, and they have given real shots for Indian talent to get into VCT, so its not their choice that no one is able to perform at the level that International players are able to perform at. </p>

	<p>Really? not try mean anything but i heard really bad news  about there especially from India open the pollution is to high and other stuff aswell</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="6036882" id="17">

	
	
	<p>Yeah Mumbai is possibly not the best city to keep any of these things because of pollution + space problem</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="6036888" id="19">

	
	
	<p>not really, Mumbai has alright AQI, and is probably the largest fanbase for VCT in India</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="6036891" id="20">

	
	
	<p>I know lol it’s not good bro not the best option to keep in </p>

		<p>Not trying to downplay pollution in Mumbai, but &#34;bad news&#34; is a bit exaggerated. (you might have mixed up, New Delhi with Mumbai 😭)</p>
<p>• Mumbai’s AQI is usually in the moderate range for most of the year, similar to Ho Chi Minh City (80-110 when its not winter, which is usually the case for both splits)</p>
<p>No mega-city in Asia has “clean” air by WHO standards, so ig we would be fine in Mumbai, any other concerns?</p>	</div>

	

	
	
</div></div></div></div><div><div data-post-id="6036847" id="4">

	
	
	<p>this is good i still dont get why they moved stage 2 finals 500m tho</p>

	

	
	
</div></div><div><div data-post-id="6036848" id="5">
