		<p>Not trying to downplay pollution in Mumbai, but &#34;bad news&#34; is a bit exaggerated. (you might have mixed up, New Delhi with Mumbai 😭)</p>
<p>• Mumbai’s AQI is usually in the moderate range for most of the year, similar to Ho Chi Minh City (80-110 when its not winter, which is usually the case for both splits)</p>
<p>No mega-city in Asia has “clean” air by WHO standards, so ig we would be fine in Mumbai, any other concerns?</p>	</div></div>
