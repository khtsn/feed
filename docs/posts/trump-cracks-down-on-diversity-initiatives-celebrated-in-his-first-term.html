They came at the urging of hard-line conservatives President Trump had appointed to run the agency, including the education secretary at the time, Betsy DeVos.</p><p>“Diversity and inclusion are the cornerstones of high organizational performance,” Ms. DeVos wrote in a 2020 memo to staff members, among a series of internal documents from that period obtained by The New York Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Mr. Trump’s second term, those same principles are now forbidden lexicon — and the employees who supported them are targets.</p><p>At least 74 people in the Education Department have been put on administrative leave in a rolling crackdown by Mr. Trump aimed at eradicating D.E.I. from the federal government.</p><p>Nearly all, it appears, had volunteered on a committee tasked with diversity initiatives, attended trainings or otherwise engaged with D.E.I. programs in some way — some at the encouragement of their managers, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, a labor union that represents 800,000 public sector workers.</p><p>Through an executive order, Mr. Trump has put a bull’s-eye on programs and job titles tied directly or exclusively to what the administration has deemed “harmful” and “wasteful” initiatives aimed at reversing systemic barriers for women, minorities and people with disabilities. But the effort has been far-reaching, hitting employees who had just been marginally exposed to such programming in past years and penalizing those who have not engaged in any D.E.I. initiatives since Mr. Trump issued his order.</p><p>The sweeping dragnet has angered and frightened those who are now facing the prospect of losing their jobs. Some are preparing to take legal action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Subodh Chandra, a lawyer representing several government employees placed on leave in the past three weeks, wrote in a letter to the Education Department’s lawyers that those who participated in anti-discrimination activities were squarely protected by federal civil rights and employment laws, which also prohibit retaliation.</p><p>“The path the department is on is a cruel and precarious one,” Mr. Chandra wrote.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Chandra said one of his clients, an Iraq war veteran, was placed on leave on Jan. 31 for attending a “diversity change agent seminar” ​last year. Another client, a West Point graduate and an Army veteran who joined an employee D.E.I. council during Mr. Trump’s first administration, was also placed on leave.</p><p>“This operates like a classic bait-and-switch scam, where political appointees of the same president were the impetus for all of the activity for which these faithful public servants, including veterans, are now being punished,” Mr. Chandra said.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Education Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>In a statement, Ms. DeVos’s chief of staff, Nate Bailey, suggested there was a difference between what she had championed as secretary and what Mr. Trump was seeking to root out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Only the fake news could be so intentionally ignorant that you confuse diversity with corrosive D.E.I.,” Mr. Bailey said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At least 74 people in the Education Department have been put on administrative leave in a rolling crackdown on diversity efforts.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Speaking at her very first all-staff meeting in 2017, Ms. DeVos told employees that building a diverse workplace was intrinsic to effective policy-making.</p><p>“In building strong teams, embracing diversity and inclusion are key elements for success,” Ms. DeVos said. “Diversity may be viewed as cliché, but I believe that getting to know, working with, befriending and including people who are different from ourselves is enriching and expanding. And if we model it ourselves, how much easier will it be to encourage students to do the same?”</p><p>Multiple employees told The Times that they had signed up for D.E.I. programs or helped run them at the behest of their supervisors because such initiatives were important to Ms. DeVos, who would later resign from her post after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.</p><p>As late as 2020, the last full year of Mr. Trump’s first term, his appointees were still taking volunteers for the department’s Employee Engagement, Diversity and Inclusion Council.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The committee’s stated mission was to promote an “environment where all employees, whatever their identities, are fully included, engaged, connected, respected, safe, satisfied and fulfilled as well as a workplace in which barriers to diversity and equal opportunity are removed,” according to its charter.</p><p>The charter for the committee — which the current Trump administration disbanded on its third day — was signed at the time by the department’s civil rights chief, Kenneth L. Marcus.</p><p>“I am committed to fostering a culture of diversity, inclusion and respect within our work force, as I believe the diversity of our work force allows us to better serve our nation’s students and families,” he wrote in a February 2020 email encouraging all employees to participate.</p><p>In June 2020, Mr. Marcus’s deputy, Kimberly Richey, followed up with members who had been selected to represent their offices, saying she was “eager” to have their first meeting, according to an email reviewed by The Times.</p><p>“As we work together to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in O.C.R., I want to urge you to keep E.E.D.I.C.’s mission statement at the center of our work,” Ms. Richey wrote, abbreviating the Office for Civil Rights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Five years later, few other agencies have undertaken as aggressive a campaign against D.E.I. as <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-takes-action-eliminate-dei" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Education Department</a>.</p><p>Ms. Richey, who as acting head of the department’s civil rights office in the final days of Mr. Trump’s first term <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/title-ix-protections-apply-only-to-biological-sex-education-department-memo-says/2021/01" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued guidance</a> barring federal protections for transgender students, was recently nominated by Mr. Trump to return to lead the office. She did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In an interview this week, Mr. Marcus said it was “appropriate” for the Trump administration to review initiatives like his to make sure that they had not turned into vehicles for discrimination against groups who have not been underrepresented historically.</p><p>“It is sadly ironic that diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which seem to advance nondiscrimination, in fact often stand for the opposite principle nowadays,” he said. “If one wants to be consistent in eliminating bias and discrimination, one has to get rid of D.E.I. first.”</p><p>Facing senators during a confirmation hearing on Thursday, Linda McMahon, Mr. Trump’s pick to run the Education Department in his second administration, claimed that D.E.I. had led to the “segregating of our schools.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It was put in place, ostensibly, for more diversity, for equity and inclusion,” she said. “And I think what we’re seeing is that it’s having an opposite effect.”</p><p>The department has declined to say what will happen to the employees who were recently placed on leave. <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/17/2024-29139/administrative-leave-investigative-leave-and-notice-leave#:~:text=Investigative%20leave%20and%20notice%20leave%20are%20permitted%E2%80%94at%20an%20agency&#39;s,the%20date%20the%20employee%20is" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">By rule</a>, federal workers cannot typically be on investigative leave for more than 10 work days, but letters that staff members have received note the leave is not “disciplinary,” suggesting it could be indefinite. Department officials have not told union officials the fate of the workers, saying that information is not available.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kenneth L.
