CBS reported that the incident occurred after he drank alcohol and took prescription medication.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Art Institute on Saturday confirmed that the report was accurate and that Rondeau had taken a leave from work. In a statement, the museum said: “The Art Institute takes this very seriously and has opened an independent investigation into the incident to gather all available information.”</p><p>Rondeau did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Founded in 1879, the Art Institute is one of the country’s leading museums, with an operating budget of $120 million and a full-time staff of about 600. Visitors come from all over the world to view its masterpieces, including George Seurat’s, “<a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A Sunday on La Grande Jatte</a>,” Edward Hopper’s “<a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111628/nighthawks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nighthawks</a>,” Paul Cézanne’s “<a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/45240/the-bathers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Bathers</a>” and “<a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28560/the-bedroom" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Bedroom</a>” by Vincent van Gogh.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last fall, the museum <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/arts/art-institute-of-chicago-fleischman-lougheed-gift.html" title="">announced</a> a $75 million gift from Aaron I.
