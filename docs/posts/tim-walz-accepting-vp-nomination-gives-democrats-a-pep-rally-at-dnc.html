Nomination</h2><h4>Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota introduced his family and rallied the crowd to get behind Kamala Harris in “the fourth quarter” of the election.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“It’s the honor of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States. We also protected reproductive freedom because in Minnesota we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make. And even if we wouldn’t make those same choices for ourselves, we’ve got a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. It took Gwen and I years, but we had access to fertility treatments. And when our daughter was born, we named her Hope. Hope, Gus and Gwen, you are my entire world. And I love you. I’m letting you in on how we started a family because this is a big part about what this election is about: freedom. So here, this is the part — clip and save it and send it to your undecided relatives so they know — if you’re a middle-class family or a family trying to get into the middle class, Kamala Harris is going to cut your taxes. If you’re getting squeezed by prescription drug prices, Kamala Harris is going to take on big pharma. If you’re hoping to buy a home, Kamala Harris is going to help make it more affordable. And no matter who you are, Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead. You know, you might not know it, but I haven’t given a lot of big speeches like this, but I have given a lot of pep talks. So let me finish with this team.” Crowd chanting: “Coach.” “It’s the fourth quarter. We’re down a field goal, but we’re on offense and we’ve got the ball. We’re driving down the field. And boy, do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced and Kamala Harris is ready.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/21/multimedia/21election-live-takeaways-walz-kgth/21election-live-takeaways-walz-kgth-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Gov.

Tim Walz of Minnesota offered himself as a bridge to disillusioned Americans who regard the Democratic Party as a bastion of coastal elitism, in a high-stakes address formally accepting the vice-presidential nomination on Wednesday night.</p><p>From the stage of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Mr. Walz completed his breathtaking transformation from little-known governor to leading party figure, accentuating his Midwestern roots and portraying the Democratic ticket as one that champions pragmatism and patriotism.</p><p>“We’re all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason: We love this country,” he said.</p><p>A month ago, many Americans outside Minnesota were unfamiliar with Mr. Walz, other than highly engaged Democrats who delighted in his punchy television appearances and memorable critiques of Republicans, whom he labeled “<a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1815951829479330211" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weird.</a>”</p><p>But on Wednesday, as he gave the most consequential speech of his career, attendees made clear they had quickly become familiar with his life story, including his background as a former high school football coach.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Before he took the stage, convention organizers handed out signs that read “Coach Walz,” and a burly group of his former players, now middle-aged, marched out to the tune of their high school fight song. Chants of “Coach” rang out during his speech, which was rife with football metaphors.</p><p>“It’s the fourth quarter. We’re down a field goal,” Mr. Walz said. “But we’re on offense and we’ve got the ball. We’re driving down the field. And boy, do we have the right team.”</p><p>He added: “We’re going to leave it on the field. That’s how we’ll keep moving forward.”</p><p>In some ways, Mr. Walz — who speaks often of “joy” and has the demeanor of a man who still can’t believe his good fortune — is the human embodiment of the Democratic Party’s head-spinning reversal of energy this summer.</p><p>After President Biden’s exit from the race and Vice President Kamala Harris’s ascent, an anxious party that was dreading November suddenly seems giddy.</p><p>“I’m having more fun than I ever imagined,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader who has been coming to Democratic conventions since 1984. “There’s such unity and excitement. Who ever thought?”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Of course, senior Democrats also think that the campaign against former President Donald J. Trump will be ugly, unpredictable and close.</p><p>That, in part, is where Mr. Walz comes in.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A wide shot of Tim Walz standing onstage at the Democratic convention, surrounded by the crowd." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/multimedia/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl/21pol-walz-speech-02-jhwl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It’s the fourth quarter.

His remarks focused far more on the details of his football coaching career than on the 12 years he spent in Congress. And he repeated a familiar line from his stump speech about his prowess as a hunter, noting he “has the trophies to prove” he was a more accurate shot than his Republican colleagues in the House.</p><p>It illustrated why Democrats hope he can help stem their losses with rural and white working-class voters — especially men — who have grown increasingly hostile to his party.</p><p>“Who better to take on the price of gas than a guy who could pull over to help change your tire?” Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said from the convention stage shortly before Mr. Walz spoke, playing up his average-Joe persona. “Who better to find common ground than a guy with Midwestern common sense?”</p></div></div><div><div><p>On Wednesday, the country also caught a glimpse of Mr. Walz’s family. His wife, Gwen Walz, who has stood out this week for the notably expressive way she watches speeches, narrated a video introducing her husband. Their two children, Hope and Gus, were seen on camera responding emotionally when Mr. Walz said that his family was his “entire world.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/21/us/harris-walz-dnc-trump/3aad130c-8794-5422-aeeb-abd7f854bdc4?smid=url-share" title="">one poignant moment</a>, his son stood up, crying, and seemed to mouth, “That’s my dad.”</p><p>Mr. Walz began his career as a culturally conservative Democrat on some issues — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/tim-walz-gun-control.html" title="">in particular, guns</a> — before evolving in recent years into a liberal favorite. His first term as governor was marked by consensus-building with Republicans who controlled one chamber of the State Legislature. But when Democrats won majorities in the 2022 election, he pressed to enact <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/us/politics/tim-walz-liberal.html" title="">a sweeping agenda of liberal priorities</a>.</p><p>“While other states were banning books from their schools, we were banishing hunger from ours,” Mr. Walz said, referring to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/dining/free-school-lunch-programs.html" title="">a bill he signed</a> that allowed public schools to provide all students with free breakfast and lunch.</p><p>But back in 2006, he <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/cq/2006/12/21/cq_2058.html" title="">also flipped</a> a largely rural and more conservative House district in southern Minnesota.</p><p>“Never underestimate a public-school teacher,” Mr. Walz, a former social studies teacher, said to cheers. Describing lessons from his time in Congress, he added, “I learned how to work across the aisle on issues like growing the rural economies and taking care of veterans, and I learned how to compromise without compromising my values.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>With his emphasis on neighborliness and his folksy style, he still speaks the language of small-town America. (His walk-on music, John Mellencamp’s “Small Town,” only drove that point home.)</p><p>The governor, a graduate of Chadron State College in Nebraska, has also relished <a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1820963380108157166" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">turning charges of elitism</a> against Republicans — Senator JD Vance, Mr. Trump’s running mate, attended Yale Law School.</p><p>“I had 24 kids in my high school class,” Mr. Walz said of his Nebraska upbringing. “And none of them went to Yale.”</p><p>Ms. Harris and Mr. Walz have both embraced traditionally right-leaning language and phrasing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/harris-walz-democrats-language.html" title="">to cast themselves as defenders of universal American values</a> like freedom and liberty, arguing that it is Republicans, with their abortion bans in many states, who are spurring government intrusion into Americans’ lives.</p><p>“In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make,” Mr. Walz said, offering a line that has become a favorite with his fans. “And even if we wouldn’t make those same choices for ourselves, we’ve got a golden rule: Mind your own damn business.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Walz, who served 24 years in the Army National Guard, seems comfortable with an emphasis on patriotic language. But Republicans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/us/politics/vance-walz-military-record.html" title="">led by Mr. Vance,</a> who served in the Marine Corps, have attacked him over his military record and how he has characterized his service.</p><p>Four veterans who investigate claims of fraudulent military service <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/tim-walz-military-service.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> that they did not believe Mr. Walz engaged in “stolen valor,” but that he did misrepresent or speak imprecisely about his record at times. Mr. Walz has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/us/politics/tim-walz-military-record.html" title="">strongly defended</a> his record, saying on Wednesday night that he “proudly wore our nation’s uniform.”</p><p>In attacking Mr. Trump, Mr. Walz turned to the kind of prairie populism that helped propel him in Minnesota, saying that the former president’s agenda “serves nobody, except the richest and the most extreme amongst us” and did “nothing for our neighbors in need.”</p><p>And he echoed arguments made by Democrats throughout the convention that Americans had grown tired of Mr. Trump’s insults and brash aggression.</p><p>“Leaders don’t spend all day insulting people and blaming others. Leaders do the work,” Mr. Walz said, comparing Mr. Trump unfavorably to the high schoolers he had taught. “So I don’t know about you: I’m ready to turn the page on these guys.”</p><p>Taylor Robinson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katie Glueck covers American politics with a focus on the Democratic Party.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-glueck">More about Katie Glueck</a></span></p></div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Times political reporter covering the re-election campaign of President Biden.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div><div><p>Reid J.
