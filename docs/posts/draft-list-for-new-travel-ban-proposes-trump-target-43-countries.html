</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal deliberations, cautioned that the list had been developed by the State Department several weeks ago, and that changes were likely by the time it reached the White House.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Officials at embassies and in regional bureaus at the State Department, and security specialists at other departments and intelligence agencies, have been reviewing the draft. They are providing comment about whether descriptions of deficiencies in particular countries are accurate or whether there are policy reasons — like not risking disruption to cooperation on some other priority — to reconsider including some.</p><p>The draft proposal also included an “orange” list of 10 countries for which travel would be restricted but not cut off. In those cases, affluent business travelers might be allowed to enter, but not people traveling on immigrant or tourist visas.</p><p>Citizens on that list would also be subjected to mandatory in-person interviews in order to receive a visa. It included Belarus, Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Turkmenistan.</p><p>When he took office on Jan. 20, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-othernational-security-and-public-safety-threats/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued an executive order</a> requiring the State Department to identify countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.”</p><p>He gave the department 60 days to finish a report for the White House with that list, meaning it is due next week. The State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs has taken the lead, and the order said the Justice and Homeland Security Departments and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were to assist with the effort.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Spokespeople at several agencies declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. But the State Department previously said it was following Mr. Trump’s order and was “committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process,” while declining to specifically discuss internal deliberations.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-travel-ban.html" title="">The Times and other news outlets reported this month</a> that Afghanistan, which was not part of Mr. Trump’s first-term travel bans but fell to the Taliban when the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2021, was likely to be part of the second-term ban. But the other countries under consideration had been unclear.</p><p>It is also not clear whether people with existing visas would be exempted from the ban, or if their visas would be canceled. Nor is it clear whether the administration intends to exempt existing green card holders, who are already approved for lawful permanent residency.</p><p>The Trump administration this past week said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/mahmoud-khalil-legal-resident-deportation.html" title="">canceled the green card of a Syrian-born former Columbia University graduate student of Palestinian descent</a>, Mahmoud Khalil, because he had led high-profile campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza that the government says were antisemitic, setting off a court fight over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/mahmoud-khalil-legal-resident-deportation.html" title="">the legality of that move</a>.</p><p>Some of the countries on the draft red and orange lists were sanctioned by Mr. Trump in his first-term travel bans, but many are new. Some share characteristics with the earlier lists — they are generally Muslim-majority or otherwise nonwhite, poor and have governments that are considered weak or corrupt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the reason several others were included was not immediately clear. Bhutan, for example, was proposed for an absolute ban on entry. The small Buddhist and Hindu country is sandwiched between China and India, neither of which were on any of the draft lists.</p><p>The proposal to sharply restrict, if not outright ban, visitors from Russia raises a different issue. While the Russian government has a reputation for corruption, Mr. Trump has been trying to reorient U.S. foreign policy in a more Russia-friendly direction.</p><p>A decision to include Venezuela could also disrupt a nascent thaw in relations that has been useful to Mr. Trump’s separate efforts to deport undocumented migrants. </p><p>The proposal also includes a draft “yellow” list of 22 countries that would be given 60 days to clear up perceived deficiencies, with the threat of being moved onto one of the other lists if they did not comply.</p><p>Such issues could include failing to share with the United States information about incoming travelers, purportedly inadequate security practices for issuing passports, or the selling of citizenship to people from banned countries, which could serve as a loophole around the restrictions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That list, the officials said, included Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Vanuatu and Zimbabwe.</p><p>During Mr. Trump’s first term, courts blocked the government from enforcing the first two versions of his travel ban, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court.html" title="">Supreme Court eventually permitted</a> a rewritten ban — one that banned citizens from eight nations, six of them predominantly Muslim — to take effect. The list later evolved.</p><p>Soon after he became president in January 2021, Joseph R. Biden Jr. issued a proclamation <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/proclamation-ending-discriminatory-bans-on-entry-to-the-united-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revoking Mr. Trump’s travel bans</a>, calling them “a stain on our national conscience” and “inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s executive order in January said he would revive the bans in order to protect American citizens “from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.”</p><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- --> and <!-- -->Edward Wong<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Draft List Proposes Travel Ban on Citizens From 43 Countries, Officials Say<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
