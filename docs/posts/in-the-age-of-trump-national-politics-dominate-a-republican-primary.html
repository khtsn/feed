Trump was in the thick of his first campaign for the White House, Jack Ciattarelli, then a Republican state assemblyman mulling a run for governor of New Jersey, called the soon-to-be commander in chief a “charlatan” who was “out of step with American values.”</p><p>“Sitting silently and allowing him to embarrass our country is unacceptable,” Mr. Ciattarelli said in a 2015 <a href="https://observer.com/2015/12/ciattarelli-blasts-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. “He is not fit to be president of the United States.”</p><p>Ten years later, Mr. Ciattarelli, the front-runner in the June 10 Republican primary for governor, has pivoted. He has praised Mr. Trump during the campaign and last month earned the president’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/nyregion/trump-endorsement-governor-new-jersey.html" title="">coveted endorsement</a>.</p><p>Like many other Republican politicians across the country, including the vice president, JD Vance, Mr. Ciattarelli has worked to paper over his past criticism of the president as Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-politics-democrats.html" title="">grown in popularity</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That effort to appeal to the G.O.P.’s conservative base is seen more as a reflection of the realities of party primaries at a polarized moment in history than as a fundamental realignment of the Republican Party in New Jersey, a left-leaning state with a high percentage of affluent suburban voters.</p><p>“It’s indicative of where Republicans are, but it’s also indicative of where a lot of voters are,” said Peter J. McDonough Jr., a retired political strategist and former aide to Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who was governor of New Jersey in the 1990s. “People are mad. People are dissatisfied — whether they’re Bernie Sanders or Trump voters.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Ciattarelli, like other Republican politicians, has sought to distance himself from his past criticism of Mr. Trump, who had a stronger-than-expected showing in New Jersey last November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Only New Jersey and Virginia hold races for governor the year after a presidential contest. In New Jersey, this stems from a decision made by framers of the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/archives/docconst47.html#page3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1947 State Constitution</a>, who changed the length of a governor’s term to four years, from three, starting with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1949/11/08/archives/jersey-prepares-for-big-election-governor-7-senators-entire-lower.html" title="">election in 1949</a> — an odd-numbered year without any federal races. One of the <a href="https://historicalpubs.njstatelib.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stated goals</a> was to force candidates to <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/n-j-has-an-election-in-odd-years-you-can-thank-the-constitution-of-1947-for-that/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remain focused</a> on state-specific issues.</p><p>In 2021, however, outrage over national issues like pandemic-related <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/nyregion/police-vaccine-nj.html" title="">mandates</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/books/book-ban-librarians.html" title="">book banning</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/nyregion/sex-ed-new-jersey-midterms.html" title="">sex education in schools</a> overshadowed local concerns, and Mr. Ciattarelli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/nyregion/murphy-wins-nj-governor.html" title="">came within three points</a> of unseating New Jersey’s Democratic governor, Philip D. Murphy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It showed that New Jersey was no longer immune from the national forces,” said Patrick Murray, a <a href="https://www.insidernj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stimsight_NJDem25toplines.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pollster</a> and chief executive of StimSight Research.</p><p>Now running for the third time, Mr. Ciattarelli openly <a href="https://x.com/Jack4NJ/status/1903283321477509580" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vied</a> for the president’s endorsement, as did a rival farther to his right, Bill Spadea, a longtime conservative radio host. A third prominent candidate, State Senator Jon Bramnick, a moderate who in the past has been an outspoken critic of the president, now stresses his willingness to work with Mr. Trump if elected.</p><p>In announcing that he was endorsing Mr. Ciattarelli, Mr. Trump alluded to his hope of flipping New Jersey red, arguing on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114497218878772156" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> that the former assemblyman would “ensure a Big Victory in this Very Important Gubernatorial Election, an Election that is being closely watched by the entire World.”</p><p>“After getting to know and understand MAGA,” Mr. Trump wrote about Mr. Ciattarelli, he “has gone ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!).”</p><p>A densely populated state filled with well-educated voters, New Jersey has seesawed between Democratic and Republican governors. Its last two <a href="https://www.nga.org/former-governors/new-jersey/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elected Republican governors</a>, Ms. Whitman and Chris Christie, were centrists who have both opposed Mr. Trump. Neither agreed to be interviewed for this article.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Last November, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/nyregion/trump-nj-votes-election.html" title="">performed far better in New Jersey</a> than he did in the 2020 election, losing the state by just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-new-jersey-president.html" title="">six points</a>, down from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-new-jersey-president.html" title="">16 points</a> against former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In more than half of the state’s counties, he won more votes than the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, as turnout lagged on the left.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A crowded rally for President Donald J.

Democrats control New Jersey’s State House and Democratic voters still vastly outnumber Republicans, despite the G.O.P.’s recent success in narrowing the gap to about <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/svrs-reports/2025/2025-05-voter-registration-by-county.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">800,000 voters</a>.</p><p>Voters who are not registered with either major political party are New Jersey’s second largest voting bloc. And a <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/may-2025-new-jersey-poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public opinion poll</a> taken last month showed that 47 percent of residents supported Mr. Trump — the same percentage as those who oppose him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Whoever wins the Republican nomination will face off against the winner of a Democratic primary that remains hard-fought, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/nyregion/new-jersey-democratic-candidates-for-governor.html" title="">six prominent candidates</a> compete for an edge in a race that is likely to be won by a small margin and be heavily dependent on voter turnout.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>There is no doubt the president’s stronger-than-expected showing in New Jersey has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/nyregion/trump-nj-governor-race.html" title="">influenced each party’s primary</a>.</p><p>Democrats have focused on pocketbook issues and how they might take on Mr. Trump from the State House. Republicans have stressed ways they align with Mr. Trump on issues ranging from abortion to immigration.</p><p>Pressed on how he might govern differently than Mr. Trump, Mr. Ciattarelli, 63, maintained that he was “in sync with what the president is trying to do.”</p><p>“Everybody has their own leadership style,” he said. “The challenges that I face in New Jersey are not necessarily challenges that he faces across the country or across the world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Spadea, 56, has said that he was disappointed not to win the endorsement of Mr. Trump, who has been a guest on his radio show and with whom he shares policy positions.</p><p>But he said he believed he would still be the choice of the president’s most ardent supporters. He received more offers of volunteer labor and small-dollar donations in the days after the president endorsed his primary opponent than at any other point in the race, he said.</p><p>“Voters win elections, not endorsements,” Mr. Spadea said.</p><p>“Look at the chatter online,” he added. “Most — I’m talking 99 to 1 — are upset that the president made the wrong choice.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bill Spadea, a conservative talk-show host, is on leave from his job to campaign for governor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>State Senator Jon Bramnick has stressed his willingness to work with the president if elected.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Even before Mr. Trump’s endorsement, Mr. Ciattarelli had raised about twice as much money as Mr. Spadea and Mr. Bramnick had each taken in, enabling him to dominate television and streaming advertising, according to AdImpact, which tracks campaign spending.
