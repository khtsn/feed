The debate, the first of two, kicks off a 20-day slate of events that comes to a head on Primary Day, June 24. (Early voting starts on June 14.)</p><h3 id="link-5cb299e1"><span>What to know</span></h3><p>Nine candidates have qualified to participate in tonight’s debate. The biggest names among them are <strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong>, the former governor of New York who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/nyregion/cuomo-resignation-governor.html" title="">resigned in 2021</a> amid sexual harassment accusations; <strong>Zohran Mamdani</strong>, a state assemblyman from Queens who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html" title="">charmed constituents and fellow lawmakers alike</a> with his progressive ideas; <strong>Adrienne Adams</strong>, the City Council speaker; <strong>Brad Lander</strong>, the city comptroller; and <strong>Scott Stringer</strong>, the former city comptroller.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Also debating are <strong>Michael Blake</strong>, a former state assemblyman from the Bronx; <strong>Zellnor Myrie</strong>, a state senator from Brooklyn; <strong>Jessica Ramos</strong>, a state senator from Queens; and <strong>Whitney Tilson</strong>, a former hedge fund executive.</p><p>The hot-button issues that candidates may spar over, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/03/nyregion/nyc-mayor-ads-candidates.html" title="">if their campaign TV ads are any indication</a>, include crime and safety, President Trump, affordable housing and corruption. Other topics that could come up are homelessness, congestion pricing, immigration and public schools.</p><p>In April, The New York Times sent the candidates a survey asking them to weigh in on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/21/nyregion/nyc-mayor-democratic-candidates-issues.html" title="">these issues</a>. We also asked them to discuss <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/21/nyregion/nyc-mayor-democratic-candidates-issues.html#big-idea" title="">the one big policy idea</a> they’d like to tackle if elected mayor. Those ideas could provide debate fodder tonight, as candidates question the viability of one another’s proposals.</p><p>Cuomo is the race’s front-runner, with the most funding and name recognition. He is also likely to be the biggest target in the debate, as his rivals may look to attack him over the harassment allegations (which he denies) and his handling of nursing homes during the pandemic. They may also seek to paint him as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/nyregion/cuomo-donors-mayor.html" title="">corrupt and out of touch</a> with the city’s working class.</p><p>Mayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent, will be absent from the proceedings. If Adams comes up in the debate tonight, it could be in reference to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/nyregion/eric-adams-trump-meeting.html" title="">ties to President Trump</a>, or to the various scandals that have dogged his administration, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor-election.html" title="">federal corruption charges against him that were later dropped</a>. Several candidates have seized on the turmoil surrounding the mayor, presenting themselves as better managers of the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-4fcf884c"><span>How to watch</span></h3><ul><li><p>The debate, hosted jointly by WNBC, WNJU and Politico New York, begins at 7 p.m. and will run until 9 p.m.</p></li><li><p>The debate airs live on WNBC-TV, WNJU-TV and Telemundo 47. <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/watch/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC New York</a> will carry a livestream of the event, and <a href="https://www.telemundo47.com/ver/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telemundo Noreste</a> will stream the debate live in Spanish.</p></li><li><p>It will be held at 30 Rock, WNBC’s studios in Rockefeller Center.

It is billed as a debate for “leading contenders,” so only those who have raised enough money by the New York City <a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/media/advisories/final-schedule-qualified-candidates-for-nyc-s-official-citywide-primary-election-debates/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Campaign Finance Board’s metrics</a> will be in attendance.
