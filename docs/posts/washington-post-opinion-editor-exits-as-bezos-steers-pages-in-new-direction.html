And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical; it drives creativity, invention and prosperity.”</p><p>In his note, Mr. Bezos said that he asked Mr. Shipley whether he wanted to stay at The Post, and Mr. Shipley declined.</p><p>“I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no,’&#34; Mr. Bezos wrote.</p><p>In a note to opinion staff members, Mr. Shipley said that he decided to step down “after reflection on how I can best move forward in the profession I love.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I will always be thankful for the opportunity I was given to work alongside a team of opinion journalists whose commitment to strong, innovative, reported commentary inspired me every day,” Mr. Shipley wrote.</p><p>The new direction envisioned for The Post’s opinion section appears to be a rightward shift for the paper. Mr. Bezos’s new focus echoes what has long been the informal tagline of The Wall Street Journal’s conservative opinion pages: “Free markets, free people.”</p><p>Will Lewis, The Post’s chief executive, said in a memo to staff that changes to the opinion section were “not about siding with any political party.”</p><p>“This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper,” Mr. Lewis wrote. “Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans.”</p><p>In his note, Mr. Lewis said that The Post would be naming a replacement for Mr. Shipley and that he would make arrangements for an interim editor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>This is a developing story.
