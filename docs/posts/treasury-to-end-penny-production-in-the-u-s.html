Ten years ago, it cost 1.3 cents to manufacture each penny. In the 2024 fiscal year alone, the cost of production rose by over 20 percent.</p><p>The U.S. Mint will keep manufacturing pennies until its supply of blanks runs out, a Treasury spokeswoman said Thursday. The Mint has estimated that ceasing production of the penny will save the taxpayers an annual $56 million in reduced material costs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Treasury forecasts that there will be additional savings once the facilities used to produce pennies are converted for other purposes.</p><p>The penny had been falling out of favor for years, and as it became less popular, the Mint scaled down its production. Penny production has fallen fairly steadily in the past decade, from over 9.36 billion coins made in 2015 to just over 3.22 billion last year.</p><p>There are still about 114 billion pennies in circulation, according to the Treasury. But eventually, once production ceases, there will not be enough of them in circulation to facilitate day-to-day transactions, meaning businesses that deal in cash may have to round prices to the nearest nickel.</p><p>While the Treasury hasn’t indicated that nickels are going anywhere, they aren’t exactly cheap to produce, either.</p><p>The nickel, worth 5 cents, cost about 13.78 cents to produce in the 2024 fiscal year, according to the U.S. Mint’s <a href="https://www.usmint.gov/content/dam/usmint/reports/2024-annual-report.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOopLddmLm85H7tyF0KKzm0elzOVOvcPDEfbpqioyeN7uUUViaQO2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual report</a>, a jump of 19.4 percent from the year before. The cost of making both nickels and pennies has outpaced the coins’ street value for 19 years running, the report said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.
