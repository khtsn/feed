Trump’s winning margins in parts of the state where he remains popular.</p><p>At a campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, the largest city in a county where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-pennsylvania.html" title="">Mr. Trump won 57 percent of the vote</a> in 2020, Ms. Harris said she would remove “unnecessary degree requirements” for some federal jobs, a pitch to Mr. Trump’s base of voters without a college education in a part of the state where he expects to perform well.</p><p>Ms. Harris also emphasized her work in California prosecuting Mexican drug cartels, and said as president she would continue to go after them “for pushing poisons like fentanyl on our children.”</p><p>The vice president’s Trump-country pitch amounted to a continuation of her attempt to appeal to moderate and right-leaning voters that began at the Democratic National Convention last month and continued during Tuesday’s debate with the former president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>No longer burdened by the apathy among elements of the Democratic base that characterized President Biden’s re-election campaign, Ms. Harris has begun trying to cut into Mr. Trump’s margin among Republicans. In her remarks on Friday, she reminded the crowd that she had endorsements from some 200 officials who had worked in recent Republican presidential administrations and campaigns.</p><p>But her most direct appeal came on policy.</p><p>“For far too long our nation has encouraged only one path to success, a four-year college degree,” Ms. Harris said. “Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths, additional paths such as apprenticeships and technical programs. So as president, I will get rid of the unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, to increase jobs for folks without a four-year degree, understanding that requiring a certain degree does not necessarily talk about one’s skills. And I will challenge the private sector to do the same.”</p><p>The Wilkes-Barre rally, which drew 6,000 people, according to the campaign, followed a stop in Johnstown, Pa., alongside Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat who for months has urged first President Biden’s campaign, and now Ms. Harris’s, to spend time with Pennsylvania voters outside the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh regions, which are both heavily Democratic.</p><p>In Johnstown, which is about 60 miles east of Pittsburgh, Ms. Harris told voters at a cafe and bookstore that she was “feeling very good about Pennsylvania because there are a lot of people in Pennsylvania who deserve to be seen and heard.”</p><p>In between events, Ms. Harris recorded an interview with the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia — the first solo television interview she has sat for since she replaced President Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Her campaign has made clear how much it values winning Pennsylvania, which, with 19 electoral votes, is the most valuable battleground state. Ms. Harris has spent six of the last seven days making public appearances in Pennsylvania. Her campaign has devoted nearly 25 percent of its television ad spending through Election Day to Pennsylvania, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact. Mr. Trump’s likeliest path to victory involves flipping Pennsylvania, which Mr. Biden narrowly won in 2020.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters greeting Ms. Harris as she arrives in Johnstown, Pa., on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Harris campaign aides have said that she must win over some swing voters in red counties, thus lowering her margin of defeat in those areas, in order to claim the state. While Ms. Harris was in red territory in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump held a news conference in deep-blue California, a state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-california.html" title="">he lost in 2020 by more than five million votes</a> and was certain to lose again.</p><p>“I feel very strongly that you’ve got to earn every vote, and that means spending time with folks in the communities where they live,” Ms. Harris said on Friday in Johnstown. “That’s why I’m here, and we’re going to be spending a lot more time in Pennsylvania.”</p><p>Johnstown is in Cambria County, which is overwhelmingly white and working-class. In 2008, Barack Obama <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/elections/2008/results/states/president/pennsylvania.html" title="">barely won</a> there. But by 2020, the political realignment brought about by Mr. Trump was complete. He beat Mr. Biden with 68 percent of the vote. Luzerne County, where Wilkes-Barre is, had a similar trend. Mr. Obama <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/elections/2008/results/states/president/pennsylvania.html" title="">won</a> the county by nine percentage points in 2008, but Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-pennsylvania.html" title="">lost</a> Luzerne by 14 points in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Harris campaign said on Friday that 16 of its 50 offices in Pennsylvania were in rural counties Mr. Trump won by double digits in 2020. That on-the-ground presence is meant to limit the damage in parts of the state the vice president is unlikely to win.</p><p>Last month, Ms. Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, spent a day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/harris-walz-pennsylvania-bus-tour.html" title="">campaigning</a> in conservative-leaning Beaver County outside Pittsburgh. Mr. Walz, a former football coach, represented a rural Minnesota district during his time in Congress, and Democrats believe he can help them with voters outside major cities.</p><p>Some Pennsylvania Democrats had hoped that Ms. Harris would choose their state’s popular Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate over Mr. Walz. Despite not being picked, Mr. Shapiro spoke at the Democratic National Convention and has campaigned frequently for Ms. Harris.</p><p>Mr. Shapiro spoke before Ms. Harris at the rally in Wilkes-Barre. On Sunday, he will headline the Harris campaign’s bus tour on abortion rights when it stops in Philadelphia.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman was not among those calling for Mr. Shapiro to be selected as Ms. Harris’s running mate. He and the governor have clashed over pardons and engaged in what is mostly a one-way feud, with Mr. Fetterman trying to shun Mr. Shapiro. They have barely appeared at campaign events together for Ms. Harris. Mr. Fetterman was not in Wilkes-Barre with the vice president.</p><p>And when they have, as at a rally in Philadelphia last month where Ms. Harris announced her selection of Mr. Walz, Mr. Fetterman did not stand when Mr. Shapiro spoke.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
