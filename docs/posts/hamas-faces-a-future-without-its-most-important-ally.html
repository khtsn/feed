Iran’s air defense systems were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/26/world/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza" title="">devastated in an Israeli attack in October</a>, and after the victory of President-elect Donald J.

Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left much of the enclave in ruins.</p><p>Dozens of Hamas commanders and thousands of its fighters have been killed. Some Palestinians blame the group’s attack on Israel for provoking the devastating campaign in Gaza. And while Hamas may never be fully eradicated, it no longer fully controls the territory it has administered since 2007.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israel’s war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left much of the enclave in ruins.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Yet a cease-fire for Gaza may still be far-off.</p><p>Before the Lebanon deal, U.S. and Palestinian officials said Hamas’s political council appeared willing to move toward its own cease-fire if Israel was willing to make compromises, particularly on removing occupying forces from Gaza.</p><p>Some American officials say Hamas might drop its demands and move forward on a cease-fire agreement acceptable to Israel’s government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But Western officials said Israel did not appear to be interested in concessions.

While Mr. Trump has urged Israel to “finish up” the war in Gaza, he is unlikely to substantially pressure Mr. Netanyahu or the Israeli military by threatening to withhold military aid.</p><p>Western officials say Israel remains skeptical of American and Arab ideas for administering Gaza after the war. Mr. Netanyahu, the officials said, believes that plans to bring in the Palestinian Authority to run Gaza are doomed to failure and that Hamas would quickly reassert control.</p><p>American officials also believe that Hamas is angling to remain in power after a cease-fire deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel seems to be waiting for President-elect Donald J.

Mr. Sinwar had steered Hamas since the conception of the Oct. 7 attack and overseen its strategic decision-making throughout the war.</p><p>But Mr. Abu Marzouk said that Mr. Sinwar delegated powers to the council because “he was on the front fighting” and having difficulty communicating with Hamas leaders outside Gaza.</p><p>Two weeks before his death, Mr. Sinwar sent a message to Hamas’s leaders telling them to prepare for a long fight, according to Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“The longer it lasts, the closer we get to liberation,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbvzPKtYEmI&amp;t=773s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Hamdan recalled Mr. Sinwar saying</a>. “Prepare yourselves for a long war of attrition against this occupation.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A house destroyed last month during Israel’s offensive in Gaza.

But some leaders have discussed potential concessions they could make if Israel showed a genuine interest in ending the war and withdrawing from Gaza.</p><p>One proposal discussed by some Hamas leaders would permit Israel to maintain a presence — at least temporarily — in the border region between Egypt and Gaza, according to two people familiar with the group’s internal thinking. Hamas officials have publicly rebuffed any long-term Israeli control of the area, which is known as the Philadelphi Corridor.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, Hamas praised Hezbollah and said it was committed to efforts to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza based on parameters it had agreed to previously. Hamas said those parameters included a cease-fire, Israel’s withdrawal, the return of displaced people to northern Gaza and an exchange of Palestinian prisoners for hostages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But beyond that broad position, Hamas remains divided over other key issues, including what role it should have in Gaza after the war and which compromises it should make with Israel.</p><p>The movement has yet to nominate a leader to replace Mr. Sinwar, a towering figure who dominated the group’s decision-making. </p><p>How the divisions will shake out is difficult to predict.</p><p>“The solution to Hamas’s military losses is simpler — there’s a pyramid of command and each commander or soldier can be replaced,” said Salah al-Din al-Awawdeh, an analyst close to the Hamas leadership and a member of the group. “But on the political level, things are far more complicated. There will ultimately need to be elections. There are different factions and balances of power. All this makes it hard to predict.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julian E.
