The move comes a day after the Biden administration tightened Chinese access to advanced American technology.</p><p>Sales of gallium, germanium, antimony and other materials to the United States would be halted immediately on national security grounds, China’s Ministry of Commerce said, citing the minerals’ use for military purposes. The export of graphite would also be subject to stricter review.</p><p>China produces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/business/china-critical-minerals-semiconductors.html" title="">almost all the world’s supply</a> of critical minerals needed to make advanced technologies such as semiconductors. Beijing has been tightening its grip on the materials, in retaliation for U.S. export controls. In October, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/business/china-critical-minerals-semiconductors.html" title="">China began requiring</a> its exporters to disclose, step by step, how the minerals would be used in Western supply chains.</p><p>On Monday, the Biden administration expanded its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/business/economy/biden-china-chips-exports.html" title="">curbs on technology</a> to China by prohibiting the sale of certain types of chips and machinery and adding more than 100 Chinese companies to a restricted-trade list. The move was the third significant action in the past three years in the Biden administration’s bid to prevent China from catching up to the United States in cutting-edge technologies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>China criticized the latest move by the United States, calling it “illegal.”</p><p>“Such practices seriously undermine the international economic and trade order, disrupt the stability of global production and the supply chain, and harms the interests of all countries,” said Lin Jian, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>Chinese industry groups representing business sectors, including semiconductors and auto manufacturing, released statements on Tuesday calling for Chinese companies to purchase more chips domestically or from countries other than the United States.</p><p>“American chip products are no longer safe and reliable, and related Chinese industries will have to be cautious in purchasing American chips,” the China Semiconductor Industry Association said.</p><p>Berry Wang<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Pierson covers Chinese foreign policy and China’s economic and cultural engagement with the world.
