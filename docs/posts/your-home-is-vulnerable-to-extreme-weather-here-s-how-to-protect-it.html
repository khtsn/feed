Tornadoes in the South and Midwest. Flooding in North Carolina. From coast to coast, a wave of extreme weather events over the past year has destroyed homes and upended lives. As the planet gets warmer, it’s essential for home buyers to consider climate vulnerability.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If you already own a home, how can you best protect it from the next weather disaster?</p><p>A good place to start is double-checking your insurance policy (hazard insurance is often required when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/11/realestate/Real-Estate-Closing-Quiz.html" title="">closing</a> on a home). You may also want to make a record of all the items in your home, as most insurance carriers require policyholders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/realestate/altadena-la-fires-insurance-list.html" title="">to submit comprehensive lists</a> of everything lost in a disaster.</p><p>Here are some more tips on how to defend your home against three distinct climate threats.</p><h2 id="link-14d62a4a">Flooding</h2><p>To best protect and prepare your home for a flood, the Federal Emergency Management Agency <a href="https://www.floodsmart.gov/first-prepare-flooding" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommends</a> purchasing flood insurance, which is a good idea even if you don’t live in a flood zone (and even if you’re a renter). But there are other ways to steps to take.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>If a strong storm is in the forecast, go outside and make sure that sidewalks, curbs and storm drains are clear of debris and leaves. Then do some checkups around the house: Does water pool around the foundation or windows? Are the gutters or downspouts clogged? If you see trouble, call a professional.</p><p>If your basement is prone to flooding, consider <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/24/realestate/home-protection-climate-change.html" title="">installing</a> French drains, a sump pump and an ejector pump, all of which can prevent water from breaching your basement floor. Installing a water alarm could be helpful too.</p><p>FEMA also suggests that homeowners “elevate and anchor” critical utilities, like electrical panels, propane tanks, sockets, wiring, appliances and heating systems. For example, if your water heater is in the basement, replace it with a tankless one mounted on the wall, or move it to the first floor. Elevating or moving some furniture and valuables to a higher floor or attic is also a good idea. You can even <a href="https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-home_flooding.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elevate</a> your entire home.</p><p>If you plan to renovate, consider installing ceramic-tile floors instead of wood and carpet, cement board instead of drywall, and flood vents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Severe winds damaged a home in Palmetto, Fla., during Hurricane Milton last October. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caitlin Ochs for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-197df">Wind</h2><p>The increase in hurricanes, tornadoes and severe thunderstorms means not just more water, but more wind. Even if your home is strong enough to fend off a wind storm, the trees and objects around it may not be.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Let’s start inside. Storm shutters, stormproof glass, and shatter-resistant film can protect windows from flying debris. If you have an attached garage, you can reinforce it by strengthening the wheel tracks. And if you have double-entry doors, secure them with a heavy-duty deadbolt. FEMA also suggests building a <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/building-science/safe-rooms" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">safe room</a> to shelter in.</p><p>Make sure that everything that lives outside — fencing, sheds, trash cans, patio furniture, gutters and downspouts — is secured and won’t become a projectile. That includes landscaping: Rock and gravel materials can ravage wood and vinyl siding. Think about mulch or dirt instead.</p><p>The roof is often the first thing to go in a fierce wind. FEMA recommends fortifying it by reattaching loose shingles and installing roof strapping — metal connectors that strengthen the connection between the roof and the walls.</p><p>Finally, strong winds can topple dead trees and send branches flying. Contact an arborist or landscape specialist to remove damaged or dead trees from your property, and consider cutting down any large trees that are close enough to land on your home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-1985c">Fire</h2><p>According to the National Fire Protection Association, <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/wildfire/preparing-homes-for-wildfire" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">small flames and airborne embers</a> are often the culprits when homes are damaged or destroyed in wildfires. Flying embers can attach to your roof’s ledges and eaves, so consider installing noncombustible roof coverings, replacing loose shingles, and installing metal-mesh screening under eaves to stop embers from getting through.</p><p>The “immediate zone” around your home — anything within five feet of the exterior — is the most important to address, according to the U.S. Fire Administration. Make sure the roof and gutters are free from dead leaves, debris and pine needles, and move anything flammable away from the walls, such as mulch, leaves and firewood. Aside from the roof, you may want to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/realestate/how-to-protect-homes-wildfires.html" title="">replace</a> your fences or decking with nonflammable materials, such as metal or tile.</p><p>To get ahead, FEMA suggests installing some external sprinklers that have dedicated power sources, in case the hydrants don’t work. Embers can also enter your home via the vents, so consider installing fire-resistant vents or covering them with metal mesh.</p><p>Ronda Kaysen<!-- --> and <!-- -->Josh Ocampo<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
