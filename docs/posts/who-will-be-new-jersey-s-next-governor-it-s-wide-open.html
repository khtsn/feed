Murphy as governor of New Jersey was never going to be dull.</p><p>But wild-card factors that might have seemed far-fetched a year ago have combined to unleash something rare in the state: a competitive race with an unpredictable outcome.</p><p>The list of well-known contenders for the seat already includes two members of Congress, the mayors of New Jersey’s two largest cities, the longest-serving State Senate president and the head of a powerful teachers’ union. Two other candidates cut their teeth in the State Legislature. There is also a popular far-right radio host and a former state senator running as “Ed the Trucker.”</p><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump’s surprisingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/nyregion/trump-nj-votes-election.html" title="">strong showing</a> in November in reliably Democratic New Jersey and a sweeping change to the rules for conducting primary elections have undone many of the state’s old political assumptions, leaving even seasoned observers riveted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It sure is different from the script we’re used to,” said Peter J. Woolley, director of the School of Public and Global Affairs at Fairleigh Dickinson University.</p><p>The field of candidates is unlikely to thin significantly before June’s Democratic and Republican primaries, where the winning margins are expected to be narrow.</p><p>“There’s an incentive in this race for people to stay in,” Professor Woolley said, “because there’s going to be an element of luck.”</p><p>At this point eight years ago, Mr. Murphy, a political novice with few allies in Trenton, had secured <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2016/10/how_did_phil_murphy_become_the_likely_democratic_n.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enough support</a> among county Democratic Party bosses that his election seemed all but assured.</p><p>But the 2025 election will play out in a vastly different political atmosphere. Mr. Murphy is prohibited by law from immediately seeking a third term, and a court-ordered overhaul of the state’s primary election ballots has made it more difficult for party leaders to quickly anoint a favored candidate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That change, which prohibited party officials from giving their preferred candidates a prominent spot on the ballot, was pushed by New Jersey’s new U.S. senator, Andy Kim. Mr. Kim’s victory was fueled in part by anti-corruption sentiment after his predecessor, Bob Menendez, was indicted and ultimately convicted of trading political favors for bribes.</p><p>The backlash also ensnared the state’s first lady, Tammy Murphy, who was assailed by claims of nepotism as she competed for Mr. Menendez’s Senate seat. Her candidacy’s early air of inevitability <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/nyregion/tammy-murphy-new-jersey-political-machine.html" title="">collapsed under pressure</a>, and she dropped out before a federal judge ordered county clerks to redesign the state’s primary ballots, depriving party leaders — and their favored candidates — of a pathway that for decades had reliably led to victory.</p><p>Next year’s primaries will be the first statewide contests held under the new system.</p><p>And the outcomes are likely to echo far beyond New Jersey.</p><p>New Jersey and Virginia are the only states with off-year races for governor, and their results are scrutinized for clues about voter sentiment every four years, ahead of the congressional contests.</p><p>Adding to the uncertainty are the gains that Mr. Trump, a Republican, made in New Jersey compared with 2020. Though he did not win the state, he lost by far less than he did against President Biden. Mr. Trump even managed to earn more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-new-jersey-president.html" title="">12 of the state’s 21 counties</a>, up from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-new-jersey-president.html" title="">seven counties</a> he won in 2020 — a potentially encouraging sign for Republicans in 2025.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There is no shortage of pressing state-based policy concerns, including how to increase racial equity within the state’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/nyregion/new-jersey-schools-segregation.html" title="">highly segregated public school system</a> and where to build desperately needed <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2024/12/5-more-nj-towns-join-lawsuit-to-block-new-affordable-housing-law.html#:~:text=In%20September%2C%20nine%20municipalities%20filed,by%20Montvale%20Mayor%20Mike%20Ghassali." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affordable housing</a>.</p><p>Still, because of its timing, the race for governor is often overshadowed by national issues and interpreted as a referendum on the party in charge in Washington. In 2021, for example, unpopular policies tied to the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to Mr. Murphy’s relatively narrow, three-point <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/nyregion/murphy-wins-nj-governor.html" title="">re-election margin</a>.</p><p>With Mr. Trump laying groundwork for what is likely to be a highly polarizing return to the White House, Democrats are hopeful they will benefit in a left-leaning state where they hold a <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/svrs-reports/2024/2024-1105-voter-registration-by-county.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">900,000-voter advantage</a>.</p><p>“He casts sort of a spell on everything,” said Ruthi Zinn Byrne, who runs a marketing firm in New Jersey and was married to a former Democratic governor, Brendan Byrne, of Mr. Trump’s ability to energize supporters — and detractors.</p><p>Still, candidates on both sides of the aisle are for now struggling to find ways to break away from the 10-person pack as voter fatigue from November’s presidential contest lingers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There seems to be a general sense of exhaustion,” said Jean Sinzdak, associate director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.</p><p>“It’s hard to break through the noise,” she added.</p><p>Early attempts to attract attention six months ahead of the primaries have offered bursts of political theater.</p><p>Two candidates began buying billboard advertising more than a year before the race and at least one created a <a href="https://www.billspadeaforgovernor.com/?utm_campaign=Spadea-for-Governor_Traffic&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Search&amp;utm_content=creative_1&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA34S7BhAtEiwACZzv4UMAkmK3sUymdGsiFVklAqhug7sswA5IKC3SATpeipxOkIE6svWeOBoCcSAQAvD_BwE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bogus website</a> using an opponent’s name in order to disparage him. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/nyregion/new-jersey-drones.html" title="">The drone hysteria</a> gripping the state has proved fertile ground for other contenders.
