Sassoon</a>, Manhattan’s acting U.S. attorney, resigned on Thursday rather than obey a Justice Department order that she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-charges-doj-trump.html" title="">drop a corruption case against New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams</a>, that she had championed, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>The order to dismiss the charges just weeks into President Trump’s second term called into doubt the independence of federal prosecutors under his administration.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office did not immediately comment and efforts to reach Justice Department officials were not immediately successful.</p><p>Ms. Sassoon was a veteran prosecutor whom the administration named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-us-attorneys-justice-department.html" title="">last month</a> to head the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York on an interim basis while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/trump-jay-clayton-attorney-southern-district-ny.html?searchResultPosition=12" title="">Mr. Trump’s choice for the job, Jay Clayton</a>, awaited Senate confirmation.

Mr. Adams had pleaded not guilty and was scheduled for trial in April.</p><p>But the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, Emil Bove III, directed Ms. Sassoon to dismiss the case and to cease all further investigative steps against Mr. Adams until a review could be conducted by the Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney, presumably Mr. Clayton, after the mayoral election in November.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
