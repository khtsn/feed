But this week, Iranian state media reported that two British nationals had been detained on suspicion of “security crimes.”</p><p>Britain’s foreign office confirmed their detention after the Iranian reports, and on Saturday issued a statement on behalf of the couple’s family.</p><p>“This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time,” the family said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. and Ms. Foreman, both in their mid-50s, were on a motorcycle tour to Australia, where Ms. Foreman, was set to deliver a paper at a conference on psychology. They reside in Spain, where Ms. Foreman worked as a psychologist and life coach and Mr. Foreman as a carpenter.</p><p>The couple’s detention first came to light when Iranian state media <a href="https://www.irna.ir/news/85749385/%D8%B3%D9%81%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%DB%B2-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%86%DA%AF%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a photograph</a> of Britain’s ambassador to Iran, Hugo Shorter, meeting with two British citizens accused of “security crimes.”</p><p>Iranian state media blurred the couple’s faces in the image, taken at the office of the prosecutor in Kerman, a city more than 600 miles east of the capital, Tehran.</p><p>In its statement, the family said it was “actively engaging with the British government and relevant authorities, working diligently to navigate the complexities of this matter.”</p><p>It is unclear how long the couple has been held in Iran. Before their detention, the Foremans shared their travels on social media. They last posted on Jan. 3, saying they were in Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“To put your minds at rest, we are having the most amazing time in Iran,” the couple said in a Facebook post, adding that they were traveling with a tour guide. On Instagram, Ms. Foreman posted a picture of herself meeting a theologian at a madrasa in Isfahan, where she wrote that “travel continues to teach me that humanity’s core is shared.”</p><p>The couple had crossed into Iran from Armenia, and were planning to head to Pakistan next, they had said.</p><p>“The UK government advises against all but essential travel to these areas, and the news paints a pretty grim picture,” they <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PPK2K/posts/pfbid0QrfAuUmG6SM35qEvrE8AiRYR83LGUXbJ7RodbFMa8g9KLpAtuxDbWRKfYms8BME2l" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on Facebook</a> on Dec. 30. “We want to find out for ourselves. That is why we are here.”</p><p>The post included two images side-by-side: one of the Foreign Office’s orange and yellow map of Iran, advising British citizens not to travel to Iran, and another of a photo of the green lawns of a mosque, an image whose location was pinned to Norduz, near Iran’s border with Armenia.</p><p>The foreign office advises against all travel to Iran, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iran" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issuing a warning</a> that “British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Iran has repeatedly jailed foreigners and dual nationals over the last decade, including an Iranian-American <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/world/middleeast/iran-arrest-reza-valizadeh-journalist-detention.html" title="">citizen</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/middleeast/cecilia-sala-italy-iran-revolutionary-guards.html" title="">an Italian journalist</a> detained last year and a Swedish E.U. official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/world/europe/iran-sweden-prisoners-johan-floderus.html" title="">arrested</a> in 2023.</p><p>Several British-Iranian dual-citizens have been among those arrested, among them Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was held <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/world/europe/iran-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-released.html" title="">for six years</a>; Aras Amiri, a 32-year-old art student; and Abbas Edalat, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/world/middleeast/iran-britain-nuclear-deal.html" title="">academic and antiwar activist</a>.
