The spokesman, Avichay Adraee, said the military was inside a buffer zone between Israel and Syria and at other points “in order to protect the Israeli border.”</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “would like to form relations with the new regime in Syria,” but said he had approved the bombing of Syrian military targets “so that those don’t fall into jihadists’ hands.”</p><h2 id="link-6dc2689c">What is Turkey doing?</h2><p>Fierce fighting was underway on Tuesday between rebels supported by Turkey and U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces near Kobani, a town in northern Syria with historical and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/27/world/middleeast/kurds-isis-syria-kobani.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">symbolic significance</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>On Tuesday, Turkish-backed fighters were “violently attacking” in the vicinity of Kobani, said Farhad Shami, a spokesman for the U.S.-allied forces.

About 1,000 U.S. Special Operations troops are housed in bases in the east and northeast of the country, often working closely with Syrian Kurdish troops.</p><p>President Biden authorized U.S. airstrikes on Sunday against Islamic State camps and operatives inside Syria.

Some received training from the United States early in the war, but most were dismissed as too extreme or too criminal.
