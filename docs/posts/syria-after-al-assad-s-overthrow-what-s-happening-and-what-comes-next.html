not allow for new confrontations.”</p><p>But the rapid rise of Mr. al-Shara’s group to power has left many questions unanswered, especially how it might govern the fractious country.

The group is now leading the transition to a new Syrian government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mohammed al-Bashir, a rebel leader affiliated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has been named as caretaker prime minister until March. 1. Mr. al-Bashir previously served as the head of the administration in Idlib, a rebel-held territory in the northwest.</p><p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s track record there <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/middleeast/rebels-syria-governing-style-idlib.html" title="">may offer some clues</a> to how it will oversee a much larger territory. The group maintained a robust internal security force to confront other military factions and domestic critics, prompting regular protests against its authoritarian methods and harsh jail conditions.</p><p>It is an open question whether these rebels can scale up what they achieved in Idlib, a poor, agrarian region with a relatively small population, throughout most of Syria.</p><p>The alliance said it would grant an amnesty for lower-level government workers and soldiers, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-justice.html" title="">vowed to hunt down and punish senior officials</a> of the previous regime who were implicated in torture and other abuses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“We will not relent in holding accountable the criminals, murderers, and security and military officers involved in torturing the Syrian people,” said Mr. al-Shara, the leader behind the rebel push, who was formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Relatives in a Damascus morgue on Tuesday, looking for bodies of loved ones who were taken to Sednaya Prison.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The group is a former affiliate of Al Qaeda that broke with the older group years ago and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/middleeast/syria-war-idlib.html" title="">came to dominate</a> Idlib, the last stronghold of Syria’s opposition during the 13-year civil war.</p><p>Geir Pedersen, the United Nations’ special envoy for Syria, said on Tuesday that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and other armed groups controlling the capital had issued “reassuring statements” about forming a government of “unity and inclusiveness.” He urged Syria’s armed groups to protect civilians and create a government that represented the country’s many ethnic and religious communities.</p><h2 id="link-56474264">Who is Ahmed al-Shara?</h2><p>Mr. al-Shara of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham recently gave up his nom de guerre after concluding the shocking military offensive that unseated the Assad regime.</p><p>He was born Ahmed Hussein al-Shara in Saudi Arabia, the child of Syrian exiles, according to Arab media reports. In the late 1980s, his family moved back to Syria, and in 2003, he went to neighboring Iraq to join Al Qaeda and fight the U.S. occupation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He spent several years in an American prison in Iraq, according to the Arab media reports and U.S. officials.

In Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has espoused a government guided by a conservative and at times hard-line Sunni Islamist ideology.</p><p>Since the rebel offensive began, Mr. al-Shara has sought to reassure minority communities from other sects and religions. Some analysts say he now faces the test of his life: whether he can unite Syrians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-bb8b108">What is Russia doing in Syria?</h2><p>Russia was a key backer of the Assad regime, intervening in Syria’s civil war with brutal bombing campaigns that helped the government defeat rebel groups. It also maintained a military presence throughout the country, including the Tartus naval base and Khmeimim air base, enabling Russia to project military power throughout the Mediterranean and northern Africa.</p><p>After the rebel alliance deposed Mr. al-Assad, Russia has moved to scale down its presence. But one key question has yet to be resolved: whether Russia manages to strike an agreement with Syria’s new government to hold on to Khmeimim and the Tartus naval base.</p><p>A New York Times analysis of satellite imagery of Khmeimim on Friday showed planes designed to transport heavy machinery prepared for loading, and Russian military equipment apparently being packed up nearby.</p><p>Two videos verified by The Times also showed at least one convoy of Russian military vehicles moving north, near Damascus and Homs, in the direction of the air base.</p><p>Russian naval and commercial activity in the key Syrian deepwater port of Tartus has also ceased since Mr. al-Assad’s government fell. Moscow has maintained a nearly continuous presence at Tartus since 1971, for the Soviet Union and then for Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Losing the Syrian bases would thwart some of President Vladimir V. Putin’s ambitions to reestablish Russia as a world power, since they are crucial to the Kremlin’s ability to flex its muscles in places as far away as West Africa.</p><p>“Syria is their only real foothold in the Middle East and the Mediterranean,” said Eugene Rumer, the director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. The rebel victory, he said, has become “part of the price they are paying for the war in Ukraine.”</p><h2 id="link-1edc4612">What is Israel doing?</h2><p>Israel is carrying out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria-military.html" title="">intensive airstrikes on military targets</a> that were controlled by the Assad government, despite warnings that its operations there could ignite new conflict and jeopardize the transition of power to an interim government.</p><p>Its ground forces have advanced beyond the demilitarized zone on the Israel-Syria border, their first overt entry into Syrian territory in more than 50 years, including on the Syrian side of the strategic Mt. Hermon. Israel has given no timeline for its departure, apart from saying that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/12/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-syria-buffer-zone-assad" title="">stay</a> until its security demands were met.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-17"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="idf-syria-map-zvxrj" data-id="100000009874020" data-source-id="100000009874020"><div slug="idf-syria-map-zvxrj" data-sourceid="100000009874020" id="embed-id-100000009874020">
