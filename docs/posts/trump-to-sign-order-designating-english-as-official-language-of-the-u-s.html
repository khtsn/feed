News of the planned order was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-executive-order-english-official-language-5c0b7665" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>“Establishing English as the official language promotes unity, establishes efficiency in government operations and creates a pathway for civic engagement,” a White House document said.</p><p>Reports of the planned order were quickly cheered by those aligned with Mr. Trump’s America First movement.</p><p>“This is HUGE,” Charlie Kirk, a conservative political activist, wrote on social media. “In an era of mass immigration, asserting that the English language as the American language, is a message of national UNITY.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But the plan quickly prompted backlash from pro-immigration groups and Democratic leaders.</p><p>“Like dozens of the other executive orders and actions that have been taken, we’re going to have to examine if what he’s doing is actually in compliance with the law and the U.S. Constitution,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House minority leader. “And to the extent that it’s not, I’m confident that he will be sued.”</p><p>United We Dream, a youth-led group, noted that the United States had never designated an official language in its history.</p><p>“We mean this with all disrespect: No gracias,” said Anabel Mendoza,<strong> </strong>the group’s communications director. “We see exactly what Trump is trying to do by continuing to put a target on the backs of Black and brown immigrants and communities who speak different languages, and we won’t tolerate it.”</p><p>The planned order also brought resistance from the American territory of Puerto Rico, in which 94 percent of residents speak Spanish.</p><p>“The president’s order declaring English as the only official language of the United States reflects a vision of American identity that conflicts with our Puerto Rican identity,” said Pablo José Hernández Rivera, the resident commissioner of Puerto Rico and a nonvoting member of the House. “There will be no statehood without assimilation, and Puerto Ricans will never surrender our identity.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers Congress with a focus on congressional investigations.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater">More about Luke Broadwater</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Registration for Undocumented Immigrants: </strong>The Trump administration said that it planned to make undocumented immigrants age 14 or older <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/immigrants-registry-trump.html">register and provide their fingerprints to the U.S. government</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Gold Card’: </strong>President Trump previewed his plans for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-gold-card-immigration.html">a new visa program</a>, describing it as “somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Suspended Refugee Program: </strong>A federal judge in Seattle <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-refugee-program.html">blocked an executive order </a>that Trump signed shortly after he was sworn in that suspended a decades-old program admitting thousands of refugees into the United States each year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Deportation Plans: </strong>Deporting migrants to Central American countries removes many political and legal hurdles for the Trump administration. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/americas/central-america-panama-trump-deportation-migrants.html">How far can the practice go before these nations reach a breaking point</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Guantánamo Bay: </strong>The Trump administration has said little about the Venezuelan men who were transferred from Texas to the U.S. military base in Cuba. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/migrant-mission-guantanamo-bay.html">Here’s what we know</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
