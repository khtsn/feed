They are showing member states’ foreign and trade ministers their suggestions in Luxembourg <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/united-states/#The%20EU%20had%20a%20trade,deficit%20of%20%E2%82%AC109%20billion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Monday</a>, and a vote on the list is expected on Wednesday.</p><p>Those tariffs would come in response to steel and aluminum levies that Washington previously announced, and they are expected to be sweeping; the preliminary list <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html" title="">covered everything</a> from whiskey and motorcycles to boats and soybeans. But they would also be just the start, an opening bid in Europe’s response to Mr. Trump’s tariff rollout.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>European officials are working on additional plans to respond to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/trump-auto-tariffs-europe.html" title="">car tariffs</a> that were announced in late March, and to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/europe/tariffs-response-trump.html" title="">across-the-board tariffs of 20 percent</a> that Mr. Trump announced last week.</p><p>E.U. leaders are hitting back in stages for two reasons. First, they needed time to digest the flurry of announcements that have come from the White House, hoping to design a response that would inflict maximum pain on the United States while minimizing the fallout for European consumers and companies.</p><p>They are also hoping that by phasing in their response, they will give the Trump administration time to come to the negotiating table. The ultimate goal is still to make a deal to avoid an all-out trade war.</p><p>“The E.U.’s committed to meaningful negotiations but also prepared to defend our interests,” Maros Sefcovic, the bloc’s trade commissioner, wrote on social media on Friday night following what he described as <a href="https://x.com/MarosSefcovic/status/1908216093405024629" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a “frank,” two-hour meeting</a> with his American counterparts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Brough Brothers Distillery in Louisville, Ky., last month.

The European Union is one of America’s most important <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trading partner</a>s. And the United States is by far the largest <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-us-trade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">export market</a> for European goods.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Given that close relationship, hitting back at American tariffs is likely to be a painful exercise, one that also costs European companies and consumers, pushing up prices on the tariffed goods.</p><p>European officials are cognizant that an escalating trade war could be painful on both sides of the Atlantic. That is why they edited the lists: Officials wanted to take into account feedback from across the continent.</p><p>The part of the list that originally included whiskey tariffs was initially meant to take hold on March 31, in fact, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/us-tariffs-eu-whiskey.html" title="">was delayed</a> for further refinement after Mr. Trump threatened to respond to it by slapping <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-tariff-european-union-whiskey.html" title="">a 200 percent tariff</a> on all European alcohol coming into the United States. Such a move would be crushing for French and Italian winemakers.</p><p>The delay came after officials — including <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-prime-minister-eu-tariffs-us-trade-war-american-products/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from France</a> — suggested that hitting whiskey and provoking American retaliation on alcohol would be a misstep.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That episode underscored the challenge in maintaining a firm and united front in responding to tariffs. Countries across the continent have different economic priorities and different appetites for hitting back at the United States. </p><p>Some countries in northern European countries have been adamant that the European Union must be forceful in its response, but Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni has called the idea that Italy must choose between the United States and the bloc “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96d02345-1079-47d0-b208-1e80bcedf684" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">childish</a>.” She has also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f820e191-348c-4298-b15f-49600be843ce" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cautioned against</a> harsh retaliation. </p><p>E.U. officials had initially hoped to avoid a trade conflict altogether.</p><p>They spent last fall and early this year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/world/europe/eu-tariffs-trump.html" title="">dangling carrots</a> — like ramped-up purchases of American liquid natural gas — in front of their American counterparts, hoping to avoid a showdown.</p><p>But that strategy failed. Instead, Washington has taken a far more aggressive tack than many analysts and officials had expected. That has left European policymakers racing to come up with a plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Two workers treating vineyards for weeds last month outside Épernay, France.
