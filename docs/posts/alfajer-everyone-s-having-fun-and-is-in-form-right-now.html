</span>… of course they&#39;re a very good team but I think we&#39;re going to win against them as well because we&#39;re in good form right now. Let&#39;s see, I&#39;m not sure, actually.”</p>

<p>With a playoffs slot in the horizon, FNATIC aren&#39;t in a position to feel pressured about their performance at the moment. The team has already done most of the heavy lifting in the group stage, much thanks to the hard work both players and staff dedicated to the wins.</p>

<p>“All the time, new faces are really nice. When you see the new faces in the team – it doesn&#39;t matter the player or coach – it makes you want to win it more. New players are always hype and they want to win. They bring that energy to you, and [it motivates you]. It&#39;s really nice.”</p>

</span> at Kickoff, FNATIC underwent a slew of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/445458/fnatic-to-part-ways-with-head-coach-elmapuddy" target="_blank">coaching</a> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/449460/fnatic-brings-the-d00m-signs-erik-and-promotes-milan-to-head-coach" target="_blank">changes</a> that included promoting <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4010/milan">
		Milan	</a>
</span> to Head Coach, signing <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/452/erik">
		Erik	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/42554/scuttt">
		Scuttt	</a>
</span>, and finally onboarding <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/53027/szed">
		Szed	</a>
</span> as a Performance coach. Despite Erik <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/461596/erik-becomes-inactive-as-fnatic-updates-coaching-staff" target="_blank">taking a step back</a>, the rest of the staff have seemingly helped FNATIC improve and stay in form throughout Stage 1.</p>

<p>While on the topic of changes, Alfajer reflected on the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428832/crashies-joins-fnatic" target="_blank">signing</a> of <span data-ref-id="12">Austin		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4/crashies">crashies</a>&#34;
		Roberts</span> and the important qualities the American brought to the team.</p>

<p>“He&#39;s a real nice guy and he&#39;s fun. You can have fun with him outside [the game] as well. The biggest and most important thing for me with him is that his native language is English. He can help you [in and out the game]. Jake, <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/438/boaster">
		Boaster	</a>
</span>, is IGL, and crashies is helping him a lot. Because their native languages are both English, they can understand each other really well and it&#39;s really nice.”</p>

<p>Many teams throughout the VCT EMEA rely on English as a common language talent from a multitude of countries can use to communicate. Sometimes, the language barriers pose an issue not just in but outside the server as well. However, high-pressure situations can often prove detrimental due to the rapid flow of communication and demand for action.</p>

<p>“I think so. For high-pressure situations, [crashies] can make us calm down a little bit. He has more experience than us and is a little bit old as well. It&#39;s really nice playing with him.”</p>

<p><img src="https://owcdn.net/img/680137f4454f5.png" alt="optic trophy image"/>
<em>International experience and veteran plays are what crashies brings to FNATIC. (Photo: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games)</em></p>

<p>However, FNATIC&#39;s key to success lies more than just in a single player. The core of Boaster, Alfajer, and <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span> have been together for over two years now. Like many trophy-hoisting rosters, a vast amount of trust, teamwork, and synergy has been built brick-by-brick.</p>

<p>“I think cores are really important. You need at least three players for a core and make the team around them. I think three players are really important for every team; if you keep those three players, you&#39;re going to be very successful one day. We did it in the past and won.”</p>

<p>Playing together and grinding out tournaments often helps partnered and Challengers teams mold talent. OFF//SEASON events such as the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2171/red-bull-home-ground-5" target="_blank">Red Bull Home Ground</a> series have offered players and teams opportunities to showcase talent and hard work. To Alfajer, such events are a breath of fresh air and a chance for him and his team to have fun.</p>

<p>“I think it&#39;s really nice. We can go see other countries as well when the tournaments are happening. The tournaments are always nice; they&#39;re competitive and fun. If you lose, it won&#39;t change anything, but if you win it makes you happy. I think OFF//SEASON events are really nice. If you change or don&#39;t change players it doesn&#39;t matter; when it comes to the OFF//SEASON everyone else is playing different games and don&#39;t touch Valorant, so OFF//SEASON tournaments bring [players] back to Valorant and preparing you for the main season.”</p>

<p>FNATIC only participated in two OFF//SEASON events ahead of their 2025 season: Red Bull Home Ground #5 and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2224/riot-games-one-2024" target="_blank">Riot Games ONE 2024</a>, the latter of which ended in a victory for the squad. Despite their success ahead of this year, missing out on Bangkok was an upset for a fan-favorite team.</p>

<p>Currently, the tenured organization is on a great path to playoffs with a very real chance at qualifying for Toronto. More slots equals more opportunities to fly to Canada, not to mention flying alongside fellow EMEA teams. Alfajer, however, wasn&#39;t sure who he thought would make it from EMEA.</p>

<p>However, when prompted on teams he wanted to play against, he immediately listed off four.</p>

</span>. I think it&#39;ll be a good matchup.”</p>

<p>A lot of strong teams have been cultivating a mix of veterans with unproven talent. Most of the teams on Alfajer&#39;s radar have pulled players from Challengers or other regions in hopes of improving. The topic of new talent kept Alfajer thinking about the endless possibilities regarding underrated players and new talent.</p>

<p>“I have to think about it. I would say <span data-ref-id="20">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/40591/comeback">
		ComeBack	</a>
</span> [is underrated]. The talent of Turkey is really good in this game. You can see a lot of players in EMEA and it&#39;s really nice but I&#39;m also kind of scared because someone might take my spot,” he jokingly said. “I think it&#39;s really good to take players when they&#39;re 16 or 17 so you can use them in the future. It&#39;s what FNATIC did with me, actually. I was like 15 or 16. I think the future of Valorant is all young players. This kind of game isn&#39;t like CS or a MOBA.”</p>

<p>“For Valorant, if you&#39;re young, you can play better because you have better reflexes. It&#39;s really important when you at least play another game [like CS] in the past. You&#39;re going to have aim, definitely. You just need to practice, and that&#39;s the easy part.”</p>

<p>As a former rookie turned world champion, Alfajer has stayed towards the higher end of the competition throughout his entire career. His goal has stayed the same throughout his journey, his dream that has kept him grinding over the years.</p>

<p>“I wanted to win [international titles]. I kind of won two, but I want to win Champions as well. I think the biggest tournament is Champions and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to end my career until I win Champions.”</p>

<p>The path to Champions is dangerous and unforgiving, but to teams like FNATIC, with tenured talent and endless ceilings, it is a challenge worth taking. Although they briefly stumbled in Kickoff, they are well on their way to making a potential run to not just Toronto, but Paris as well.</p>

<p>“I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to miss any more Champs… I&#39;m definitely going to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Paris</a> because Champions is different from every other tournament.”</p>

<p>FNATIC&#39;s next matchup will be against GIANTX in Group Alpha of the VCT EMEA followed by a battle against Team Heretics. Only time will tell if the hard work and dedication Alfajer and the rest of his team will pay off.</p>
