Trump.</p><p>Its leaders, Govs. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Jared Polis of Colorado, are among a group of ambitious Democrats likely to try to fill a party-wide leadership void once President Biden leaves office.</p><p>“Donald Trump is going to bring people into his administration who are absolute loyalists to his cult of personality and not necessarily to the law,” Mr. Pritzker said. “Last time, he didn’t really know where the levers of government were. I think he probably does now. And so I think that the threat remains great.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>What exactly the organization will do is not entirely clear. In interviews, Mr. Pritzker, Mr. Polis and Julia Spiegel, a former top legal adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California who will serve as the group’s top staff member, did not say how many governors had agreed to join the organization. Also unclear is the funding mechanism beyond “philanthropic support,” though Mr. Pritzker, a billionaire, said he was not underwriting the group himself.</p><p>Mr. Pritzker has had conversations with Republican governors about joining the organization, he said, but he declined to add whom he had spoken with.</p><p>The two Democratic governors and Ms. Spiegel spoke in broad strokes about the group’s ambitions to coordinate resources across state lines to protect state courts, elections and laws against encroachment from what they expect to be a hostile federal government.</p><p>Regardless of how effective the organization becomes, it is likely to give Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Polis a platform to speak on behalf of blue-state officials.</p><p>Mr. Polis said he did not expect his state’s democratic functions to be under immediate threat starting on Mr. Trump’s Inauguration Day. Instead, he said, Mr. Trump’s presence in office will create a growing danger that requires vigilance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“There’s not an overnight erosion that occurs on Jan. 20,” he said. “There’s a threat of an ongoing erosion over the future administration, and we want to prevent that from occurring.”</p><p>The group is modeled after an abortion rights organization that Ms. Spiegel helped Mr. Newsom form after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. That group, the Reproductive Freedom Alliance, includes 22 Democratic governors and helped organize efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/16/us/politics/trump-2025-democratic-resistance.html" title="">stockpile abortion pills</a> before this year’s presidential election.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
