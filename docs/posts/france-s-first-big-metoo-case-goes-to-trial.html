Of grooming her for three years, when on Saturday afternoons he would touch her sexually. When it began, he was 36. She was 12.</p><p>Five years ago, the French actress Adèle Haenel shocked the country’s film world when she spoke out about the director Christophe Ruggia, who had cast her as the lead actor in a 2002 film about an incestuous relationship.</p><p>On Monday, the case went to court, marking the first major #MeToo accusations in France to proceed to trial. Mr. Ruggia, 59, is charged with aggravated sexual assault against a minor. If he is found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in prison as well as a fine of up to 150,000 euros, about $190,000.</p><p>Mr. Ruggia has repeatedly denied the allegations, saying that his relationship with Ms. Haenel was strictly platonic and that he never sexually harassed or touched her inappropriately. His lawyer Fanny Colin had refused to speak publicly before the trial, but had said that Mr. Ruggia intended to plead not guilty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adèle Haenel, left, and Noémie Merlant in a scene from “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” the movie that brought Ms. Haenel to prominence internationally.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Neon</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Ruggia was a relatively unknown director before the allegations. But in the insular world of French cinema he had a reputation for making films about social justice and for defending migrants and human rights. He spoke up on behalf of workers in the industry, leading him to take on a prominent role in the French directors’ association.</p><p>Ms. Haenel, 35, said she decided to speak out about what happened to her after watching a 2019 documentary about the pop star Michael Jackson’s relationship with two young boys, and learning that Mr. Ruggia was working on a film with two teenage actors at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s a responsibility for me,” she said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QbNS4Aan3I" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mediapart video interview</a> that year. “I work. I have projects going on. I am comfortable, materially. I am not in the same precarious situation as most of the people this happens to.”</p><p>Still, she had gone 15 years without speaking publicly about the abuse, and had never gone to the police. That was because, she explained in the video, she felt there was “systemic violence against women in the justice system.”</p><p>“Justice ignores us,” she said, “we ignore justice.”</p><p>Days after the article was published, the Paris prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case. Ms. Haenel decided to participate in the process. It became a four-year investigation.</p><p>In a letter sent to Mediapart, Mr. Ruggia denied the allegations but said he understood the powerful influence he may have had on Ms. Haenel as the director who first discovered her talent. “At the time, I did not see that my adulation and the hopes I placed in her could have appeared to her, given her young age, as painful at certain moments,” <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/061119/temoignage-d-adele-haenel-la-reponse-de-christophe-ruggia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote</a>. “If this is the case and if she can, I ask her to forgive me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Haenel at her home in Paris in 2020.

While #MeToo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/23/us/metoo-replacements.html" title="">quickly toppled several powerful men</a> in Hollywood after the movement began in 2017, in France there was strong resistance. “Many artists blurred, or wanted to blur, the distinction between sexual behavior and abuse,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/movies/adele-haenel-france-metoo.html" title="">Ms. Haenel said</a> in a 2020 interview with The Times.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Just a few months after Ms. Haenel spoke out, the director <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/world/europe/roman-polanski-charlotte-lewis-defamation-france.html" title="">Roman Polanski</a> was given the most prestigious award at the annual César ceremony — best director. Mr. Polanski was convicted in 1978 of having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in the United States.</p><p>Ms. Haenel, who was nominated for best actress, staged an unplanned protest at the ceremony, standing up in her navy gown, turning her back to the stage, making a zero with her fingers and shouting “Shame!” before leaving the theater.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.telerama.fr/debats-reportages/j-ai-decide-de-politiser-mon-arret-du-cinema-la-lettre-d-adele-haenel-a-telerama-7015465.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter published in a French culture magazine</a> in 2023, Ms. Haenel explained her decision to leave cinema — an industry she said protected sexual abusers and would rather victims “disappear and die in silence.”</p><p>“I am canceling you from my world,” she <a href="https://www.telerama.fr/debats-reportages/j-ai-decide-de-politiser-mon-arret-du-cinema-la-lettre-d-adele-haenel-a-telerama-7015465.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p><p>“The reception in France to Adèle Haenel’s declarations in 2019, in reality, testifies to the resistance in the industry,” said Geneviève Sellier, an emeritus professor of cinema studies at Bordeaux Montaigne University and the author of “The Cult of the Auteur.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Haenel, right, taking part in a demonstration against sexual harassment in the theater community outside an awards ceremony in Paris in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“She was alone. She was followed by almost no one.” She added, “In the end, the price she paid was extremely heavy because she no longer works in cinema.”</p><p>The #MeToo movement in France’s movie business was rekindled last year when the actress Judith Godrèche <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/movies/judith-godreche-metoo-abuse-france.html" title="">accused two directors</a> of sexually abusing her when she was a child actress. </p><p>Her public announcements came shortly after a <a href="https://www.france.tv/france-2/complement-d-enquete/5454513-gerard-depardieu-la-chute-de-l-ogre.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">television investigation</a> into France’s most decorated actor, Gérard Depardieu, who has faced and denied several accusations of sexual misconduct. The documentary included footage of him making crude and sexist comments about a prepubescent girl during a 2018 trip to North Korea, which caused another shock wave in France.</p><p>A couple of months later, two women filed a lawsuit against Mr. Depardieu accusing him of sexual assault during the shooting of a film in 2021, which he has denied. He was due to appear in court last month, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/europe/gerard-depardieu-sexual-assault-trial.html" title="">his lawyer said he was too ill to attend</a>. His trial has been postponed to March.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At Ms. Godrèche’s prompting, the French lower house of Parliament launched a committee to examine sexual violence in the film and other artistic industries in France.</p><p>Perhaps because of Ms. Haenel’s public criticism of the justice system in France, the police investigation into her case has been extremely rigorous and detailed. The overview of the case by the investigative judge is 35 pages.</p><p>“Justice treated Adèle Haenel’s case efficiently and allocated resources you don’t find in many cases,” said Marine Turchi, the Mediapart journalist who broke the story.</p><p>The investigating judge interviewed 26 people, including 11 members of the cast and crew of “The Devils,” Mr. Ruggia’s 2002 film in which Ms. Haenel plays an autistic child in an incestuous relationship with her brother. Several crew members said the director had an “intense,” “ambiguous” and “unhealthy” relationship with the actress, isolating her from others. Some reported seeing him kiss her on the face and cheeks.</p><p>Others, such as Ms. Haenel’s co-star Vincent Rottiers, said they had not seen any inappropriate behavior from Mr. Ruggia. The film’s producer and one of its editors also said they saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Haenel in Chatham, N.Y., in October 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren Lancaster for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>After the film was shot, Ms. Haenel regularly visited the director’s apartment to watch films, so he could teach her the classics, she said. While there, he caressed her thighs, working his way up to her genitals, kissed her on the neck and put his hand under her T-shirt to stroke her breasts and her belly, she told the police.</p><p>“Christophe was telling me that he was in love with me and that the age difference was a curse to him and that unfortunately I was an adult in the body of a child,” she told the police.</p><p>Ms. Haenel said that she refused to see Mr. Ruggia after 2004, and the police have collected two letters that he sent to her years later. In them, he wrote that his heart was “exploding in his chest” after he saw her on the street one day, that his longing for her was like a “wound” and that his love for her had “always been sincere.”</p><p>After the Mediapart investigation, Mr. Ruggia’s new film involving the teenage actors, “The Emergence of Butterflies,” was put on hold and he was ejected from the French directors’ association. He told the police that other projects he had in the works had also been put on hold because of the investigation, and that he had lost his job at a prestigious theater school. He is living on welfare in Brittany, close to his parents’ home, he added.</p><p>The trial is scheduled to last about two days.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
