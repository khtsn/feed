It is the latest in a series of operations in search of militants that have churned up roads and left many Gazans hiding in their homes in fear.<span>   </span>At least 10 people have been killed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/world/middleeast/why-israel-targeting-jenin.html" title="">the raids this week,</a> and more than 40 others have been wounded, the Palestinian Health Ministry said on Wednesday. </p><p>The official Palestinian prisoners’ commission said that dozens of people had been arrested.</p><p>Israel’s military said in its statement on Thursday that the two militants were killed in a shootout in the village of Burqin, just west of Jenin, the day before. An Israeli soldier was injured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hamas-run al-Aqsa TV put out photos of both men and said they were members of its armed wing. At the same time, Palestinian Islamic Jihad acknowledged the death of the two men who it said had conducted the attack. It said that Mr. Nazzal, 25, was a leader of its Jenin battalion. </p><p>In a statement on Telegram, a social messaging app, it said that he had died “after engaging in a clash with the enemy forces that besieged him.” It was not clear whether Mr. Nazzal was a member of both groups.</p><p>The operation comes amid sharply rising tensions in the West Bank, as the militants have grown in power and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/world/middleeast/israel-settlers-attack-jit-west-bank.html" title="">settler violence</a> against Palestinian civilians has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/middleeast/west-bank-settlers-trump.html" title="">soared</a>.</p><p>In the militant attack on June 6, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on a civilian bus and cars. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/world/middleeast/israel-trump-settlers-west-bank-gaza.html" title="">Israeli settlers attacked</a> the village this week along with other towns in the West Bank, setting fire to vehicles and properties, according to Palestinian officials and the Israeli military.</p><p>During its raids in recent years, Israeli bulldozers have torn up roads and water pipes, searching for explosive devices planted by militants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mohammad Jarrar, the mayor of Jenin, said thousands had fled the neighborhood known as the Jenin camp, the focus of the Israeli operation. Those who remained were cut off from electricity and running water, he said, creating the potential for a “humanitarian disaster.”</p><p>“Each time we rebuild, only for the next raid to destroy again,” he said.</p><p>The city had opened some public shelters to receive people displaced by the Israeli military’s operation, but was struggling to provide them with enough food and supplies, Mr. Jarrar added. </p><p>Israeli soldiers have set up checkpoints near Jenin’s major public hospital, inspecting every vehicle that entered and left the medical complex, said Wissam Bakr, the hospital director. The troops mostly let ambulances go through relatively quickly after inspection, said Dr. Bakr, but occasionally the soldiers held them up, causing delays.</p><p>The Israeli campaign comes after security forces with the Palestinian Authority, which administers some West Bank areas under Israeli occupation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/middleeast/palestinian-authority-west-bank-israel.html" title="">carried out an operation</a> of their own in Jenin after largely ceding security there to Israeli forces.</p><p>Israel’s latest operation appears to be the most significant since a 10-day raid into the West Bank in August and September that killed 39 people, most of whom died in Jenin, according to Palestinian officials. The raids also demolished homes, shops and roads.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The United Nations has condemned the violence in the West Bank, and the world’s highest court, the International Court of Justice, issued an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/19/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas/icj-israel-palestinian-territories-occupation?smid=url-share" title="">advisory opinion</a> in the summer saying that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and its settlements there, violated international law. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel criticized the opinion and said the settlements are legal.</p><p>Jenin is a center for Palestinian resistance in the West Bank — to both Israel’s occupation and the Palestinian Authority — and many young men there have joined Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other armed groups.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
