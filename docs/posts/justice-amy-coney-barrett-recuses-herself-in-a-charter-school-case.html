She has also worked with Notre Dame Law School’s Religious Liberty Clinic, which is part of St. Isidore’s legal team.</p><p>Although justices sometimes provide reasons when they recuse themselves, they are not required to. That practice was codified in the fall of 2023, when the justices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/us/politics/supreme-court-ethics-code.html" title="">announced the court’s first ethics code</a>.</p><p>The code followed months of revelations that some justices, most prominently Justice Clarence Thomas, had <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/supreme-court-scotus" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">failed to disclose</a> luxury travels and gifts from wealthy benefactors.</p><p>One major question during the debate over the ethics code was when justices must step away from a case because of an actual or perceived conflict of interest. The policy is far looser than that for lower court judges. The justices each decide for themselves, rarely recuse and never have to share their reasoning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/us/supreme-court-ethics-rules.html" title="">reporting by The New York Times</a>, during internal conversations, several of the justices had focused on their “duty to sit,” or obligation to hear cases, pointing out that if a justice recuses, there is no one to take that justice’s place.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abbie VanSickle covers the United States Supreme Court for The Times.
