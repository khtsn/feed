    <h1>Trump Proposed Slashing $163 Billion in Spending</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The White House sent a letter today to Congress that laid out President Trump’s proposals for government spending in the next fiscal year. The blueprint called for $163 billion in cuts that would eliminate a vast set of climate, education, health and housing programs, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/02/us/trump-budget-2026" title="">whittle down domestic spending to its lowest level in the modern era</a>.</p><p>Trump’s plan, which administration officials called a “joint project” with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, would formalize his campaign to drastically remake the federal government. The proposal depicted many core government functions as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical. Democrats immediately rebuked it, and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-congress-republicans.html" title="">some big-name Republicans took issue</a>. Others, like Speaker Mike Johnson, endorsed the plan.</p><p>Sometimes, presidential budget recommendations are not all that important, our economics reporter Tony Romm told me. Congress controls spending, and it can simply ignore the proposal. “But Trump’s budget this year carries extra significance,” Tony said. Republicans are eager to cut spending to offset a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/republicans-trump-tax-cuts.html" title="">package of tax cuts</a> — a draft of which they hope to release soon.</p><p>Tony added: Trump has adopted the contentious view that he has expansive power to dictate spending even if Congress instructs otherwise — “meaning some of the ideas here may foreshadow big changes to come.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>With its tax-exempt status, Harvard does not pay most taxes and donors can write off gifts on their own tax returns.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A garment factory in Guangzhou, China, last month. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-518a1a25">The U.S. and China remain at a standoff over tariffs</h2><p>Officials in Beijing said today that China was considering holding trade negotiations with the Trump administration, but they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/asia/china-us-tariffs-talks.html" title="">reiterated a precondition</a>: The U.S. must first cancel its tariffs on Chinese goods, which are now being taxed at a minimum of 145 percent.
