name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>This Sunday, the New York City Marathon will feature some extra star power — of the gold, silver and bronze variety — with many Olympians racing in the elite field.</p><p>Partially because of timing after the Paris Games, the nonprofit New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, was able to recruit more Olympians, including the men’s silver medalist, Bashir Abdi, and several American Olympians: Conner Mantz, Clayton Young and Dakotah Lindwurm. The men’s gold medalist, Tamirat Tola, and the women’s bronze medalist, Hellen Obiri, will also return to New York to defend their 2023 titles.</p><p>Whether you are a runner, a spectator or somebody with no interest in the marathon who is just trying to get around the city, here’s what you need to know about this year’s race.</p><h2 id="link-72d9648">Weather forecast</h2><p>The temperatures are expected to drop this weekend back into more fall-like ranges. Sunday is shaping up to be partly cloudy, but dry, with lows right around 50 degrees and highs in the low 60s. Not ideal for a marathon this late in the fall, but better than the temperatures in the high 70s that showed up during the week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-7086611c">What time does the marathon start?</h2><p>After the elite men’s race begins, the remaining runners are divided into five waves based on their expected finish times. This prevents runners from getting too jammed up in the race’s early stages.</p><p><strong>8 a.m.</strong> Professional wheelchair division</p><p><strong>8:22 a.m.</strong> Handcycle category and select athletes with disabilities</p><p><strong>8:35 a.m.</strong> Professional women</p><p><strong>9:05 a.m.</strong> Professional men</p><p><strong>9:10 a.m.</strong> Wave 1 of the remaining runners</p><p><strong>9:45 a.m.</strong> Wave 2</p><p><strong>10:20 a.m.</strong> Wave 3</p><p><strong>10:55 a.m.</strong> Wave 4</p><p><strong>11:30 a.m.</strong> Wave 5</p><h2 id="link-2dcfdda7">What is the marathon route?</h2><p>The race begins on Staten Island, and then turns north through Brooklyn and Queens. Next, runners head west across the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan, north into the Bronx and back to Manhattan. The finish line is in Central Park, near the West 60s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="marathondrive-map-gvqaz" data-id="100000009161520" data-source-id="100000009161520"><div slug="marathondrive-map-gvqaz" data-sourceid="100000009161520" id="embed-id-100000009161520">

Mile 20, <strong>around 135th Street and Alexander Avenue</strong>, is a notoriously challenging part of the course where some runners hit the proverbial wall.</p><p>And if you like to do your cheering in a crowd, the stretch of <strong>First Avenue from 59th to 96th Street in Manhattan</strong>, which is lined with bars and restaurants, is always jammed with spectators.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-443ed9c6">When are runners expected to finish?</h2><p><strong>9:30 a.m.</strong> Professional men’s wheelchair athletes</p><p><strong>9:40 a.m.</strong> Professional women’s wheelchair athletes</p><p><strong>11 a.m.</strong> Professional women</p><p><strong>11:15 a.m.</strong> Professional men</p><p><strong>11:55 a.m. on</strong> Remaining runners start crossing the finish line</p><p><strong>8:30 p.m. on</strong> Final runners start crossing the finish line</p><h2 id="link-344a5716">Which streets are closed?</h2><p>The upper level of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Staten Island and Brooklyn, will close at 11 p.m. on Saturday and reopen at 4 p.m. on Sunday.
