One foggy, wintry morning in the early 1990s, he went to visit 93 of his Marines whose names are set in the Wall’s stones.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I’m there sort of feeling like I’m by myself, and I see <a href="https://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/12855/RAYMOND-R-DELGADO/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ray Delgado</a>’s name, who was a kid in my platoon,” Mr. Marlantes said in an interview. “And I just reached up, and I started to touch his name, and I hear this woman’s voice behind me.</p><p>“She says, ‘Did you know Ray Delgado? He’s my uncle.’</p><p>“I mean, out of 59,000 dead names, and one morning in the winter out of thousands, the niece of Ray Delgado shows up when I’m touching his name?” Mr. Marlantes continued. “You gotta say that’s not just coincidence. The odds are really against it. And so what is that? There’s some kind of energy here, or maybe it’s Ray, or I don’t know.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A pair of combat boots left at the Wall this month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Some leave things behind when they visit.</p><p>At the end of most days, volunteer guides take the keepsakes to a nearby visitor center. From there, many of the items are taken to a warehouse, where they are cataloged and archived.</p><p>One veteran who has most likely seen more of the Wall, the visitors and what they left behind there over the years than anyone is <a href="https://www.vvmf.org/About-The-Wall/history-of-the-vietnam-veterans-memorial/Jan-Scruggs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan Scruggs</a>, who fought in Vietnam and raised private donations to build the memorial when he returned home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Scruggs estimates that he has come to the Wall about 1,000 times since it opened to the public in 1982.</p><p>Weeks before Memorial Day, he was there again, speaking to an association of helicopter pilots who fly medical evacuation missions. Some in the group flew those missions in Vietnam.</p><p>The messages left at the Wall by children — often adorned with drawings in crayon or marker — affect him the most.</p><p>“Things that are written by hand, by younger people, who are just learning how to write, but they’re trying to pour their souls out,” Mr. Scruggs explained, adding that in sum they were “a ton of just good stories, they capture people, they’re worth reading, they’re worth writing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A drawing in honor of Lance Cpl.

Visitors can use those to make a “rubbing” of a name carved into the Wall.</p><p>On their cellphones, the guides look up the exact location of a name and lead visitors there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A directory that includes service branch, rank and date of death helps visitors find names on the Wall.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For names high up on a stone, the guides grab one of a half-dozen stepladders lying in the grass nearby and climb to the site.

He was shot, and his body was torn apart. “Dad identified his body because he recognized his feet,” she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/10971/WILLIAM-R-CRANE/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Crane, an Army first lieutenant</a>, was killed on Dec. 18, 1969, in Binh Long, Vietnam.
