Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., two men with famously big egos and a desire to expose what they view as a corrupt federal bureaucracy.</p><p>But if Mr. Kennedy is confirmed to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, several of his key priorities may run counter to those of an administration with a game plan bent on deregulation. Mr. Trump’s choice for White House chief of staff, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/susie-wiles-trump-lobbying.html" title="">Susie Wiles, comes from a lobbying firm that represented the very industries</a> that Mr. Kennedy hopes to disrupt.</p><p>Over the past two decades, Mr. Kennedy, a lawyer and longtime environmentalist, has turned his passion toward health issues, many of which — apart from his questioning of vaccine safety — traditionally align better with the Democratic Party he left behind. When it comes to tearing down corporate capture among the giants — Big Pharma, Big Ag, Big Food, among others — Mr. Kennedy’s ideas echo those of some of the incoming Trump administration’s loudest critics.</p><h2 id="link-4fe74fd4">Michelle Obama</h2><p>Mr. Kennedy, who recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/rfk-jr-trumps-fast-food.html" title="">criticized</a> Mr. Trump’s penchant for fast food, has been clear about his plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/health/rfk-big-food-artificial-dyes-trump.html" title="">go after</a> ultra-processed foods that contribute to the growing rates of diabetes and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/well/obesity-epidemic-america.html" title="">obesity in the United States</a>. Those goals sound familiar to anyone who lived through the Obama administration, when Michelle Obama started the Let’s Move! campaign as first lady to encourage healthier diets and lifestyles among children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Obama was a driving force behind former President Barack Obama’s creation of a task force on childhood obesity. Under his administration, federal agencies released updated nutrition labels and the ubiquitous “MyPlate” icon that replaced the food pyramid. Most consequentially, she championed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which increased funding and raised nutritional standards for school lunches. The vegetable requirements and rules for sodium and flavored drink products under that law, signed in 2010, were <a href="https://sph.washington.edu/news-events/news/obama-era-school-nutrition-policy-led-better-diets-students-faces-changes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dialed back</a> under the first Trump administration.</p><h2 id="link-dbeb75">Gavin Newsom</h2><p>The week before the election, Mr. Kennedy declared the “first thing” he would do as part of the Trump administration would be: “Tell the cereal companies, ‘Take all the dyes out of their food.’” But in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has already beaten him to it.</p><p>Mr. Newsom, a staunch progressive, last year became the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/health/california-ban-red-dye-food.html" title="">first governor</a> to sign a law banning the use of Red Dye No. 3 in foods like candy, cookies and frostings. Federal regulators prohibited the use of the chemical in cosmetics in 1990 over cancer concerns, but the ingredient remained legal in the food supply. The Food and Drug Administration has said it is reviewing the evidence, and other states are now considering <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S6055/amendment/A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar</a> bans.</p><p>While Mr. Kennedy was vowing on the campaign trail in September to get the “poison” off grocery store shelves, Mr. Newsom signed a second bill that prohibited the use of six different dyes in foods served in California public schools. The authors of the bill cited evidence that the dyes could cause <a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/press-release/report-links-synthetic-food-dyes-hyperactivity-and-other" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">neurobehavioral</a> issues in some children.</p><h2 id="link-766b867b">Bernie Sanders</h2><p>Mr. Kennedy’s nonprofit group, Children’s Health Defense, may be best known for spreading misinformation about vaccines, but that venture is part of its broader initiative to “systematically remove Big Pharma corruption”: ban drug advertising, remove regulators’ conflicts of interest and — its most universally supported aim — secure affordable drug prices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Enter the progressive senator and liberal icon Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of the loudest critics of the <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/sanders-khanna-aim-to-control-drug-prices-by-threatening-generics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">levers</a> of Big Pharma. As chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Sanders has beaten the drum against a health care system he calls “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/bernie-sanderss-new-campaign-taking-on-big-pharma-and-starbucks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dysfunctional</a>”<span>  </span>and commissioned <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/big_pharmas_business_model_report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> on pharmaceutical companies’ business models — <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/9.23.2024-Novo-Nordisk-Untenable-Strategy-final.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of them</a> titled in part, “Greed, Greed, Greed.”</p><p>Mr. Sanders has pushed a series of proposals to control drug costs and at one point <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/06/12/sanders-hold-nih-director-drug-prices/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed to oppose</a> every nomination to a health post until President Biden produced a detailed plan to lower prices. It’s just one area in which the politicians’ messages of anti-corporate economic populism have echoed one another’s so much that a former pollster for Mr. Sanders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/us/politics/rfk-jr-young-voters-latinos.html" title="">started to wonder</a> whether Mr. Kennedy would draw in a proportion of his base.</p><h2 id="link-3a4f4fcc">Cory Booker</h2><p>Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, published an <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/4966468-trump-kennedy-food-system/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion piece</a> the day before the election decrying Mr. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again initiative. To anyone who hoped for change to the broken food system, he said: “Don’t be fooled.”</p><p>But he also <a href="https://x.com/CoryBooker/status/1858493341416968617" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a video</a> last week in which he began to sound — at least to some of his constituents — a lot like Mr. Kennedy himself.</p><p>“We’re prioritizing corporations feeding us unhealthy products instead of family farmers growing fresh, healthy foods,” he wrote in the post, on the X platform. “We all must come together to build a system that works for all.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy, who was once known mostly for his <a href="https://www.morningagclips.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-on-monsanto-lawsuit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">work</a> as an environmental lawyer and now promotes <a href="https://www.maha.vote/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regenerative agriculture</a>, shared Mr. Booker’s video and thanked him for his “long history of leadership on this issue.”</p><p>If Mr. Kennedy earns a permanent role in the Trump administration, he might eventually find some camaraderie across the aisle for taking on Big Agriculture. Mr. Booker has pushed <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-introduces-package-of-bills-to-reform-us-food-system" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an array of bills</a> to reform the sector and has been vocal about his concerns regarding <a href="https://www.climateone.org/audio/cory-booker-taking-big-ag-going-big-climate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agricultural pollution</a>.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy could, of course, face headwinds in his own administration. His experience suing Monsanto for the health effects of glyphosate, an ingredient in its herbicide, sets up an interesting quandary for Mr. Trump, whose first administration was responsible for <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/480914-epa-reapproves-roundup-pesticide/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reapproving</a> the chemical.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Baumgaertner is a national health reporter for The Times, focusing on public health issues that primarily affect vulnerable communities.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-baumgaertner">More about Emily Baumgaertner</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>15</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Kennedy Has Odd Bedfellows on Some Issues<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/health-and-human-services-department">Health and Human Services Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F.
