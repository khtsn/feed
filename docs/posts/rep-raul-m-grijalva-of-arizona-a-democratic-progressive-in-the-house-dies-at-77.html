Grijalva, a former political radical who became a Democratic stalwart of Arizona’s congressional delegation and who was one of the most left-leaning lawmakers on Capitol Hill, representing a majority Hispanic district, died on Thursday in Tucson. He was 77.</p><p>Mr. Grijalva (pronounced gree-HAHL-vah) disclosed last year that he had lung cancer and would not run for a 13th term in 2026. He died of complications of his treatment, his office said. He was absent from Washington for nearly a year, missing hundreds of votes in the narrowly divided House.</p><p>The son of a Mexican immigrant father who labored on Arizona ranches, Mr. Grijalva as a young man was an activist in the Raza Unida Party, a hard-left movement to gain political power for Mexican Americans. He eventually mellowed and became a Democrat, moving up in Tucson politics for nearly 30 years before running successfully for Congress in 2002 at age 54.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In Washington, Mr. Grijalva was an advocate for tough labor and environmental protections, earned an “F” rating from the National Rifle Association and opposed a fence on the Mexico border. He was known for an informal style that favored bolo ties over neckties, and he once offered in jest that his campaign slogan should be “Grijalva: Not just another pretty face.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Grijalva, left, during a House Education Committee hearing in 2003.

Biden to end his re-election campaign. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephen Crowley/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A co-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in the House for a decade, Mr. Grijalva was the first member of Congress to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for president in 2015. After President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s poor performance in the presidential debate against Donald J. Trump last June, Mr. Grijalva was one of the first House members to call for Mr. Biden to leave the race.</p><p>“What he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat — and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race,” Mr. Grijalva <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/03/us/biden-trump-election/ca8862ec-86af-5baa-a168-cf08bbcc15b8?smid=url-share" title="">told</a> The New York Times.</p><p>In 2018, when Democrats won majority control of the House in an electoral rebuke of Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Grijalva assumed the chairmanship of the Committee on Natural Resources, which oversees issues he cared strongly about.</p><p>In that role, he pressed for stricter regulations on mining on public lands and on offshore oil drilling. And when the Trump administration proposed weakening the Endangered Species Act at the behest of landowners and industry groups, Mr. Grijalva said, “The Trump administration doesn’t seem to know any other way to handle the environment than as an obstacle to industry profits.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Joining Native American leaders, Mr. Grijalva sought federal protection of historically tribal lands near the Grand Canyon. In August 2023, President Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/grand-canyon-national-monument-biden-9382960f18408dce7aec52f103404e11" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designated</a> 1,500 square miles in the region as a new national monument.</p><p>As a progressive, Mr. Grijalva was often out of step with his generally conservative state, including on immigration. When Arizona lawmakers in 2010 passed an immigration crackdown known as SB 1070, which opened the door to what critics called racial profiling by law enforcement, he called for national groups to boycott the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Grijalva at work on Capitol Hill in 2003.

The woman was paid more than $48,000 by the Natural Resources Committee to settle her complaint in 2015. The House Ethics Committee reviewed the case in 2019 and determined that the payment was acceptable.</p><p>Before his election to Congress, Mr. Grijalva acknowledged that he had a drinking problem. He pleaded guilty after he was charged with drunken driving in 1985 and spent 12 days in an alcohol-abuse program.</p><p>In 2018, Mr. Grijalva told a TV interviewer that he had had a drinking problem years earlier but had overcome it. “Once you wrestle the demons and you beat them, you beat them,” he said.</p><p>Raul Manuel Grijalva was born on Feb. 19, 1948, in Canoa Ranch, south of Tucson. His father, Raul, came to the United States under the Bracero program, a midcentury agreement between the U.S. and Mexico that allowed Mexicans to work as farm laborers; his mother, Rafaela, was from the copper mining town of Ajo, Ariz., and spoke no English.</p><p>His survivors include his wife, Ramona, and their three daughters, Adelita, Raquel and Marisa. He lived in Tucson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Grijalva graduated from Sunnyside High School on the south side of Tucson in 1967 and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from the University of Arizona, also in Tucson.</p><p>He traced his political awakening to the shame he felt as a teenager over his Chicano heritage. “I was actually made to feel I wanted to be an Anglo,’’ he told a Tucson newspaper in 1975. “I realized what I was doing, and my embarrassment turned to anger.”</p><p>His early activism included pressing the University of Arizona for a Mexican American Studies program and leading protests to carve out a “people’s park” from a city-owned golf course in a Mexican American neighborhood. Some of the protests turned violent.</p><p>In 1972, Mr. Grijalva lost a Tucson school board race as a candidate of the Raza Unida Party, which had been founded in the Southwest to advance Chicano nationalism. He began to cultivate a more moderate image, engaging in outreach to non-Hispanics.</p><p>Two years after his defeat, he won a school board seat in 1974 and remained a member through 1986. He was elected to the Pima County Board of Supervisors in 1988 and served for 15 years, resigning in 2002 to run for Congress.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Trip Gabriel is a Times reporter on the Obituaries desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/trip-gabriel">More about Trip Gabriel</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-house-of-representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
