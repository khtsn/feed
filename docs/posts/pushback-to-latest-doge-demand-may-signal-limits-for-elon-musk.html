missive</h2><p>Monday could bring a standoff between Elon Musk and huge swaths of the federal government, including Trump-appointed agency leaders.</p><p>The fate of the latest example of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/business/dealbook/elon-musk-jack-welch-cuts.html" title="">Musk’s brutal management style</a> — having government workers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/elon-musk-email-federal-workers.html" title="">justify their employment</a> by midnight or risk being fired — may reveal the limits of President Trump’s cost-cutter-in-chief’s efforts.</p><p><strong>“For now, please pause any response,” </strong>a top Pentagon official told employees this weekend, adding that the Defense Department “will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures.” Similar messages went out from Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence; Kash Patel, the director of the F.B.I.; the State Department; and more.</p><p>What’s notable is that Trump loyalists lead many of those organizations. But The Times reports that many agency leaders are “tired of having to justify specific intricacies of agency policy and having to scramble to address unforeseen controversies” raised by Musk, especially after the billionaire’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency gained unprecedented access to government systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>It raises the prospect that the Musk approach has its limits.</strong> Yes, Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/us/politics/elon-musk-email-federal-employees.html" title="">made a similar move</a> at the social network once known as Twitter. But the federal bureaucracy moves much more slowly than a private company — and has unions who can push back.</p><p>The president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest such union, declared Musk’s missive “plainly unlawful” and added that the Office of Personnel and Management was being directed by “the unelected and unhinged Elon Musk.”</p><p><strong>The Department of Government Efficiency is falling in esteem among voters,</strong> at least according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-gets-middling-grades-americans-top-issues-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-02-23/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent polls</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/republicans-congress-town-halls-trump.html" title="">growing number of town halls</a> held by Republican politicians.</p><p>Some G.O.P. governors are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/22/republican-governors-doge-musk-022226" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still defending Musk’s work</a>, even as their own states’ finances are being strained by halts in federal funding and layoffs of government employees.</p><p><strong>What will Trump do?</strong> The president initially encouraged Musk to be more “aggressive” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/23/us/trump-news#trump-cpac-speech" title="">bragged about the scale</a> of the tech mogul’s job cuts.

The iPhone maker stands to lose out should the president hit China with more tariffs: In Trump’s first term, Cook persuaded him to forgo new levies that could have hurt iPhone sales.</p><p><strong>European stocks and the euro rise after German voters choose a new chancellor. </strong>Friedrich Merz and his center-right Christian Democrats gained enough support <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/takeaways-germany-election.html" title="">to lead the country</a> with just one other coalition partner, according to the latest poll results. But Merz may struggle to approve more military spending, potentially drawing the ire of President Trump. (The hard-right Alternative for Germany, which Elon Musk supported prominently, underperformed slightly but will be the biggest opposition party.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Investors brace for Nvidia earnings and new inflation data this week.</strong> The chipmaker at the heart of the A.I. boom reports results on Wednesday, a big event for this quarter’s earnings season.
