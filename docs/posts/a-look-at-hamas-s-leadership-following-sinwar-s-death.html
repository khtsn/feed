Long considered by Israel and the United States as the planner of Hamas’s military strategy in Gaza, Mr. Sinwar also took on the role of the organization’s political chief two months ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/06/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-gaza" title="">after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh</a>.</p><p>For months, Mr. Sinwar had evaded the sort of Israeli efforts to find and kill him that have led to the deaths of other senior officials in Hamas, including Mr. Haniyeh.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hamas’s leadership structure is opaque, but here is what is known about some of Hamas’s most prominent figures who are still believed to be alive or whose fate is unclear:</p><h3 id="link-3458d1a6"><span><strong>Khaled Meshal, a former political head of Hamas</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Khaled Mashal in Doha, Qatar, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Born near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Mr. Meshal became the leader of Hamas’s political office in 1996, directing the group from exile. Two years later, Israeli agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/18/world/jordan-is-angered-by-israeli-findings-on-assassination-fiasco.html" title="">injected him with a slow-acting poison</a> in Jordan, sending him into a coma before he was saved by an antidote provided by Israel as part of a diplomatic deal with Jordan.</p><p>Mr. Meshal spent his career moving from one Arab nation to another, living in Kuwait, Jordan, Qatar and Syria. When he stepped down as head of the political office, he was succeeded in 2017 by Mr. Haniyeh. Mr. Meshal remains an influential official in the group.</p><h3 id="link-1583f789"><span><strong>Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy leader of Hamas in Gaza</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Khalil al-Hayya in Damascus, Syria, in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Louai Beshara/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. al-Hayya, who now lives in exile in Qatar, has been a Hamas official for decades and is Mr. Sinwar’s deputy.

After 22 months spent in a Manhattan jail on suspicion of terrorism, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/world/terror-suspect-freed-by-us-flies-to-jordan.html" title="">agreed</a> to relinquish his permanent resident status in the United States and said he would not contest the terrorism accusations that led to his detention.

Mr. Deif has since orchestrated multiple attacks on Israel, including a series of suicide bombings in 1996.</p><p>In July, Israeli forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-deif-assassination-attempt.html" title="">bombarded a densely packed coastal area of Gaza</a> with heavy munitions in an attempt to kill Mr. Deif. Scores of Gazans were killed in the attack. Israel’s military later said that it had killed Mr. Deif in the strike.
