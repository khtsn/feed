As she walked by Mr. Weinstein, who was shaking his head, she looked directly at him and pointed a finger at him. She then pointed at her tear-streaked face before striding away.</p><p>The scene, in a Manhattan courtroom last week, transported observers back five years to when she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial-jessica-mann.html" title="">left the witness stand in a similar way</a> during Mr. Weinstein’s first trial, crying during her testimony.</p><p>Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Arthur L. Aidala, objected to her actions in court last week, saying they had tainted the jury and moving for a mistrial. The judge rejected the motion, and the trial will continue on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Mann was the last of three accusers to testify against Mr. Weinstein at his retrial on sex crime charges. She, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial-mimi-haleyi.html" title="">Miriam Haley</a>, a former television production assistant, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-kaja-sokola-testimony.html" title="">Kaja Sokola</a>, a former model, are the core of prosecutors’ argument that Mr. Weinstein used his power in Hollywood to harass and sexually assault women.</p><p>Here is what happened last week and what to expect as Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers prepare to make their case.</p><h2 id="link-5b60817">A dismal dance</h2><p>Ms. Mann’s testimony at the current trial closely resembled what she told the first jury.</p><p>She recounted meeting Mr. Weinstein when she was about 27 and had moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Shortly after their first meeting, she said, he pressured her into giving him a massage. She described his back as covered in blackheads and having the “texture of bark.”</p><p>The charges against Mr. Weinstein involve a March 2013 encounter between the two at a Manhattan hotel. Ms. Mann was visiting New York and had planned a morning meal with friends and the producer, she testified. He arrived early and got a hotel room over her objections, she said.</p><p>Nonetheless, she testified, she accompanied him to the room, where he injected his penis with medication that produced an erection and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial-jessica-mann.html" title="">raped her</a>. It was the first time she recalled him “putting his penis inside of me,” she said. She tried to fight, she said, but eventually “I just gave up, I wanted to get out.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Afterward, she testified, the breakfast proceeded as planned, and she did not tell anyone about the attack.</p><p>“I’m going to bury this so deep,” she recalled thinking. “And I’m going to forget about this and move on with my life.”</p><p>As time passed and she struggled in her acting career, she said, she fell into a complex relationship with Mr. Weinstein that included friendly email exchanges, phone calls and several consensual sexual encounters. She called it a “dance” in which she tried to keep him both happy and at a distance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jessica Mann left the witness stand in tears and confronted the man she says abused her.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In 2017, when the first accusations of sexual assault against Mr. Weinstein surfaced, she finally told others about how he had attacked her, she testified. She was seen at an emergency room for anxiety and suicidal thoughts after the accusations emerged, she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I thought it was just me,” Ms. Mann told the jurors, adding, “It was the first moment in my life that I realized that this is who he was and I just like, it was a paradigm shift that it wasn’t my fault.”</p><h2 id="link-1e0f768a">A yearslong relationship</h2><p>On cross-examination, Mr. Aidala spent hours trying to discredit Ms. Mann’s testimony, arguing that she and Mr. Weinstein had consensual sex regularly and that she had decided to enter a real relationship with Mr. Weinstein at one point.</p><p>Mr. Aidala questioned her about emails after the hotel episode in which she gave Mr. Weinstein her new phone numbers. She introduced him to friends as a powerful contact and defended their friendship to a boyfriend, Mr. Aidala said.</p><p>Mr. Aidala argued that Mr. Weinstein was not the cause of Ms. Mann’s struggles. She had complained to doctors about anxiety and panic six weeks before the sexual assault accusations against Mr. Weinstein first emerged, he said. Ms. Mann had also lost a job and had broken up with a boyfriend during that period, Ms. Aidala said.</p><p>Mr. Aidala also challenged Ms. Mann’s testimony about not wanting money from Mr. Weinstein. She received almost $500,000 through a settlement fund after Mr. Weinstein’s downfall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“This is not about money for me,” Ms. Mann said.</p><h2 id="link-128cc80d">What to expect in the sixth week</h2><p>Prosecutors are expected to rest their case this week after more witnesses testify, including an expert who has been called to discuss why sexual assault victims sometimes maintain contact with their attackers and do not tell the authorities.</p><p>The defense will then present its case. A petition to allow testimony a former friend of Ms. Mann’s gave at the first trial to be introduced as evidence gave a glimpse of the defense strategy for trying to discredit the prosecution’s witnesses.</p><p>Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers said in the petition that they could not find the former friend<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial.html" title="">, Talita Maia</a>, who testified previously that Ms. Mann had never mentioned an assault.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering criminal justice in New York, with a focus on the Manhattan district attorney&#39;s office and state courts.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
