		Malaspina</span> on the bench after a year-long stint, and have promised more updates soon regarding their 2025 roster.</p>

<p>vanity&#39;s year-long journey with Cloud9 began with a trophy during the 2023 OFF//SEASON, at the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1807/ten-global-invitational/playoffs" target="_blank">TEN Global Invitational</a>. During the VCT season, though, vanity &amp; co. had trouble piecing together a solid performance, never making it beyond the top six in 2024.</p>

<p>Cloud9 were eliminated in the group stage of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1923/champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff/group-stage" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> with a loss to <span data-ref-id="2">

</span>. They have few notable wins to their name in the months since and, despite making playoffs in both stages of competition, Cloud9 were eliminated in the opening knockout round on both accounts.</p>

<p>This was not the first time vanity carried Cloud9&#39;s colors. His first spell with the organization lasted between August 2021 and March of last year, during which time he led his team to be the only North American representative at the playoffs of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/449/valorant-champions-2021/playoffs" target="_blank">Champions 2021</a>, but suffered with lacklustre results throughout the rest of his stint.</p>

<p>Cloud9 have promised &#34;more updates soon&#34; and have confirmed their presence in off-season tournaments hosted in the coming months.</p>

		<p>Idk if you saw Stellar on 100T but bro is not going to be a competent T1 player. OXY(duelist) Verno(Initiator) Add3r (sent) Skuba (smokes) Runi (flex). Make me an Assistant assistant Coach, and its a trophy incoming.</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="3964847">
		
		
		<p>im genuinely so confused as to why ppl think add3r is a player who is obviously going up to tier 1, even from his own team im taking corey or wedid (his condition is obvious hindering this but in theory) in tier 1 all day before add3r and arguably stellar as well. add3r is a decent player and he picked up deadlock well, but imo there are a good amount of players id take in tier 1 before him</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="3966329">
		
		
		<p>I mean stellar has been a decent IGL in t1 yeah he had his moments but overall I still think he is better than vanity add3r is whatever who would u take in his place?</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="3972884">
		
		
		<p>i would still take vanity over stellar to be honest, 100T&#39;s highs with stellar on the roster were still based more on individuals rather than consistent calling. vanity has a decent track record of overperforming with weaker rosters, as well as developing young talent. but his teams do tend to run out of gas by the end of seasons, i would say he just needs the right coach pairing and a solid roster that is a little more experienced and he could def be making internationals. over add3r, i would probably take aproto or v1c as a sentinel and as just any role + 1 i would take seven, penny, thief</p>
