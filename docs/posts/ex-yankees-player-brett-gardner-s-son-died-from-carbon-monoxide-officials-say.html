Miller Gardner’s test showed a saturation of 64 percent, he said, adding that anything over 50 percent was lethal.</p><p>Mr. Zúñiga said that other tests were also performed, including drug tests, but they were all negative. He said the autopsy report found telltale signs of carbon monoxide poisoning on the organs, and added that the case could be considered closed.</p><p>Miller and his family were staying at a resort in Costa Rica.
