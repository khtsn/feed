    <h1>Two Watchdogs Were Rebuffed From Joining Trump’s Cost-Cutting Effort</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Eisen is a former White House ethics official under President Barack Obama. Ms. Canter worked as an attorney for both Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton. They recently founded a nonprofit, State Democracy Defenders Fund, which aims to track the actions of the cost-cutting effort, nicknamed DOGE, after an internet meme. Earlier, their nonprofit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/doge-records.html" title="">sent public-records requests to federal agencies</a>, seeking details about the inquiries they had received from Mr. Musk’s and Mr. Ramaswamy’s team so far.</p><p>If appointed to the efficiency project, Mr. Eisen and Ms. Canter said they would be able to be in-house watchdogs, guarding its work against conflicts of interest. Both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" title="">Mr. Musk</a>, the world’s richest man, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/vivek-ramaswamy-potential-conflicts.html" title="">Mr. Ramaswamy</a>, a billionaire, own businesses that could benefit financially from shifts in federal policy.</p><p>While Mr. Trump has said the effort would lead to drastic savings and reforms, the efficiency department’s role is just to provide recommendations. Only Congress can make any cuts.</p><p>The two activists also said they could help insulate the efficiency department from allegations that it was violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act — a 1972 law that requires committees of nongovernment employees be “fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented.”</p><p>Two leaders of another watchdog group, Public Citizen, made <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/letter-public-citizen-co-presidents-request-appointment-to-department-of-government-efficiency/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a similar request</a> to join the cost-cutting effort earlier this week. </p></div></div>
