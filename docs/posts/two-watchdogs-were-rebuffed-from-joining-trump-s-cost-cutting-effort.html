Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-government-trump.html" title="">on a hiring spree</a>, looking for tech executives and conservative activists to dig into the federal government and look for rules and spending to cut.</p><p>On Thursday, two activists from a left-leaning watchdog group asked: Where do we sign up?</p><p>“We write to request our appointment as members of the ‘Department of Government Efficiency,’” wrote Norman Eisen and Virginia Canter, in a letter to Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the leaders of Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/podcasts/the-daily/musk-doge-trump.html" title="">unofficial effort that plans to slash regulations and spending</a>.</p><p>The Trump transition team’s response: no.</p><p>“President Trump’s Truth made clear we have no room in our administration for Democrats,” said Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition, in an email to The New York Times.</p><p>She appeared to be referring to a post that the president-elect made on his social media network Truth Social, listing people whose allies his administration would not hire. The post did not mention Democrats by name — many of those listed were Republicans or former Trump appointees who had criticized Mr. Trump in the past — but it ended with a catchall prohibition against “people suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Eisen is a former White House ethics official under President Barack Obama. Ms. Canter worked as an attorney for both Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton. They recently founded a nonprofit, State Democracy Defenders Fund, which aims to track the actions of the cost-cutting effort, nicknamed DOGE, after an internet meme. Earlier, their nonprofit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/doge-records.html" title="">sent public-records requests to federal agencies</a>, seeking details about the inquiries they had received from Mr. Musk’s and Mr. Ramaswamy’s team so far.</p><p>If appointed to the efficiency project, Mr. Eisen and Ms. Canter said they would be able to be in-house watchdogs, guarding its work against conflicts of interest. Both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" title="">Mr. Musk</a>, the world’s richest man, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/vivek-ramaswamy-potential-conflicts.html" title="">Mr. Ramaswamy</a>, a billionaire, own businesses that could benefit financially from shifts in federal policy.</p><p>While Mr. Trump has said the effort would lead to drastic savings and reforms, the efficiency department’s role is just to provide recommendations. Only Congress can make any cuts.</p><p>The two activists also said they could help insulate the efficiency department from allegations that it was violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act — a 1972 law that requires committees of nongovernment employees be “fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented.”</p><p>Two leaders of another watchdog group, Public Citizen, made <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/letter-public-citizen-co-presidents-request-appointment-to-department-of-government-efficiency/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a similar request</a> to join the cost-cutting effort earlier this week. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>It has not been accepted so far, the co-president of Public Citizen, Lisa Gilbert, said Thursday.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>David A.
