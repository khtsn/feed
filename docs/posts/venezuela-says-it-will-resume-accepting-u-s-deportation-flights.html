    <h1>Venezuela Says It Will Resume Accepting U.S. Deportation Flights</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Trump administration had claimed that the Venezuelan migrants who had been sent to El Salvador were all criminal gang members, but the families of some of those men, as well as immigration lawyers, argued that this was not the case for all the deportees sent to El Salvadoran prisons. And the administration provided little detail as to whom the individuals it sent there actually were. There seemed to be little to no due process at play.</p><p>Mr. Trump has appeared captivated by the ability to send people to the prison complexes in El Salvador, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-suggests-tesla-vandals-prison-el-salvador/story" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatening on Friday</a> that those caught vandalizing Teslas could be banished there for 20 years.</p><p>The president and allies, including Elon Musk, went to war with the judge over his order restricting deportations, calling for the judge’s impeachment. The rapidly escalating spat caused Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. of the Supreme Court to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/chief-justice-roberts-impeachment-trump.html" title="">weigh in with a rare statement</a>, admonishing the calls for the judge’s impeachment. This spurred <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-deportations-constitutional-crisis-impeachment.html" title="">concerns of a constitutional crisis</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration has continued to stonewall the judge’s questions about the deportations to El Salvador. “The government is not being terribly cooperative at this point,” said the judge, James E. Boasberg, at a hearing on Friday. “But I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order and who was responsible.”</p><p>Saturday’s agreement could help Mr. Trump accelerate his plans for mass deportations, one of the central promises of his campaign. He has already enlisted military planes, sent people to third countries far from their homes and invoked the wartime law to achieve that goal. Arrests inside the country are up sharply relative to those in the Biden administration, but they are well below the levels Mr. Trump and his immigration advisers want.</p><p>The agreement to resume the deportation flights to Venezuela also comes a day after the Trump administration said that it would end a Biden-era program that allowed hundreds of thousands of people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to enter the United States lawfully and work for up to two years.</p><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- --> and <!-- -->Annie Correal<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
