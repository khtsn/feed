The agreement mandates that the police department improve those policies as well as other guidelines, including how it responds to protests and demonstrations.</p><p>“Police reform doesn’t happen overnight,” Kristen Clarke, the assistant attorney general overseeing the Justice Department’s civil rights division, said on Thursday during a news conference in Louisville. “This process will take time, but it will reap dividends down the line.”</p><p>The agreement, which must be approved by a judge before it can take effect, is part of a broader effort by the Justice Department under President Biden to address abuses at the hands of the police. Overall, 13 such agreements are in place, two of which were negotiated during Mr. Biden’s time in office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Typically, these agreements last until the judge has found that the department achieved the established goals. But Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville said the arrangement was intended to limit oversight to five years. In some cases, consent decrees can last for far longer. <a href="https://www.baltimorepolice.org/transparency/consent-decree-basics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baltimore Police Department</a>, for example, continues to operate under a consent decree that began in April 2017.</p><p>Mr. Greenberg noted the changes that have already been made since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html" title="">the death of Ms. Taylor</a>, 26, who was fatally shot by the police in March 2020 during a botched raid of her apartment. The police entered unannounced and without a warrant. </p><p>The city passed Breonna’s Law, which bans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/breonna-taylor-law-passed.html" title="">“no-knock” warrants</a> in which officers break into a residence without warning. And the city has also offered more mental health counseling for officers, updated training programs, named an inspector general and assigned a civilian review board to monitor the department.</p><p>Ms. Taylor’s death prompted protests across the country and calls for police reform. Those calls grew after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/george-floyd.html" title="">George Floyd</a>, a Black man, was pinned to the ground and killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis two months later.</p><p>Mr. Greenberg said he was committed to making changes outlined in the deal, regardless of the change in administrations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Regardless of who is president, regardless of who is attorney general, we have made a commitment to the people of Louisville two years ago that we were going to implement continuous improvement to” the police department, work that will continue into the future,” he said.</p><p>But Republican administrations have typically been less aggressive in pursuing police misconduct, raising concerns that such abuses may go unaddressed by the federal government when President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office next year. In 2018, during Mr. Trump’s first administration, his attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/sessions-limits-consent-decrees.html" title="">curtailed the use of consent decrees</a>.</p><p>If the Justice Department’s civil rights division stops investigating these abuses, that could be seen as a green light to local law enforcement to act freely,” said Christy E. Lopez, a professor at Georgetown Law who teaches classes on criminal justice.</p><p>“I think it’s going to matter to the tenor of what law enforcement is up to, like how they’re approaching their work,” Ms. Lopez said. “Some people will be emboldened.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eileen Sullivan covers breaking news, the Justice Department, the trials against Donald J.
