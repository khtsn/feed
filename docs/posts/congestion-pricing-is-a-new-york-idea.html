Most drivers crossing into the heart of Manhattan are now being charged $9 by E-ZPass readers and cameras set up along the new tolling zone, which runs from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan.</p><p>These are some of the most traffic-saturated streets in the world, where cars crawl along at under 5 m.p.h. during rush hour in Midtown. Transportation leaders hope the new tolls persuade more motorists to leave their cars behind and take mass transit instead. </p><div><p>The tolls will help finance crucial repairs and improvements to New York City’s aging subway system, buses, and two commuter rail lines. </p><p>A few New Yorkers were eager to hit the streets to mark the start of the tolling program, which began just after midnight on Sunday. </p><p>Supporters chanted, “Pay that toll! Pay that toll!” while critics banged a cowbell.</p><p>Noel Hidalgo, 45, who lives in Brooklyn, was among the first drivers to pay the new toll. As he drove his Mini Cooper across the threshold, toll supporters cheered and clapped from the curb.</p><p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the program, said the tolls were started on Sunday to be able to work out any kinks on a day when traffic is lighter than usual.</p><p>Hours into the program, there were no reports of any major problems, according to the M.T.A. Still, many streets were mostly empty on a freezing Sunday right after the holidays, with the real test for the tolling program yet to come during the workweek.</p><p>Here’s how the program works:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Where will drivers be charged?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How much will the tolls cost?</strong></p><p>Those driving smaller commercial trucks and some buses will pay a toll of $14.40 at peak hours and $3.60 at other times. Drivers of larger trucks and tour buses will be charged $21.60 at peak hours and $5.40 off-peak.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are there exemptions, credits or discounts?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Are the tolls a done deal?</strong></p><p>Opponents in New Jersey and New York have also fought the tolls for more than a year through litigation that could stop the program even after it has begun. But federal judges have recently ruled against the plan’s opponents in several lawsuits.</p></li></ul><p>Bernard Mokam<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="49" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZTY5MDY4MDctODA3OC01YWMyLWIyMjEtNWIwYTkxYzU5NTlh"><div id="e6906807-8078-5ac2-b221-5b0a91c5959a" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#e6906807-8078-5ac2-b221-5b0a91c5959a"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Olivia Bensimon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/reader-center/author-olivia-bensimon/author-olivia-bensimon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/reader-center/author-olivia-bensimon/author-olivia-bensimon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/reader-center/author-olivia-bensimon/author-olivia-bensimon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T16:22:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 11:22 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><span itemprop="name">Olivia Bensimon</span></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from New Jersey</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Stefan Philips, 25, lives in Hudson County, N.J., and commutes all over New York City for work as a construction engineer.

And already, some drivers are thinking about ways to avoid the new congestion pricing tolls that will apply to those who enter the busiest part of Manhattan.</p><p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the city’s subways and buses as well as two commuter rail lines, depends on tolls to fund its operating budget. They are paid at nine bridges and tunnels — some of which connect to the new tolling zone — and <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/111531" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">add up to about $2.4 billion each year</a>, or about 13 percent of the M.T.A.’s budget. In 2022, the M.T.A. estimated that it had lost $46 million in revenue to scofflaws at its bridges and tunnels, about 2 percent of its toll earnings.</p><div><p>The M.T.A. began collecting new congestion tolls for drivers who enter Manhattan at or below 60th Street. The tolls are expected to generate $500 million annually for three years, before the authority raises rates and revenue projections. But the authority could miss out on some of that money because of drivers who forge, alter or obscure their license plates to avoid toll readers and traffic cameras, turning their vehicles into so-called ghost cars.</p><p>Some drivers use camera-proof screens and sprays, as well as stickers, tape and other objects. They also scrape letters off their plates or use temporary paper tags.</p><p>On social media, drivers have shared other ideas to avoid the new congestion pricing tolls illegally. One TikTok user posted a video that suggested avoiding cameras by cutting through a certain parking garage with an entrance on 60th Street and an exit on 61st Street. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/1912wxm/ulpt_request_how_to_bypass_nyc_congestion_tax/?rdt=49463" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a Reddit thread</a>, users suggested covering license plates with bird feces and purchasing devices that conceal or block license plates at the press of a button.</p><p>Public officials have stepped up their fight to remove ghost cars from the city, seizing more than 20,000 ghost cars over the past three years.</p><p>In December, the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/914-24/mayor-adams-governor-hochul-removal-73-000-ghost-cars-illegal-motorized#/0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Police Department and Sanitation Department announced</a> that they had seized and impounded more than 7,500 such vehicles off the road in 2024. Michael Kemper, the M.T.A.’s chief security officer, said officials had arrested 700 people during crackdowns on toll evasions this year.</p><p>Besides toll evasion, police officials say ghost cars and other illegal vehicles are used to help carry out violent crimes, including shootings and robberies.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="47" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-Capsule3"><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="45" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZmNlMmZjZDYtMDcwZC01OTAwLTg5YWEtNGY0YzMxMDhhNzVi"><div id="fce2fcd6-070d-5900-89aa-4f4c3108a75b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#fce2fcd6-070d-5900-89aa-4f4c3108a75b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/wesley-parnell"><img alt="Wesley Parnell" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/15/reader-center/author-wesley-parnell/author-wesley-parnell-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/15/reader-center/author-wesley-parnell/author-wesley-parnell-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/15/reader-center/author-wesley-parnell/author-wesley-parnell-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T15:57:46.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 10:57 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>City officials hope that the tolls will encourage drivers to take public transit.

The fee falls to $2.25 in off-peak hours. But trucks entering the zone at busy times will pay up to $21.60, based on size and time of entry, with no cap on the number of tolls per day.</p><p>That could add up quickly for thousands of trucks entering the zone several times a day, said Zach Miller, the vice president of government affairs for the Trucking Association of New York, a statewide trade group. Trucks deliver nearly 90 percent of all goods within the five boroughs.</p><p>“If you’re circling 59th Street three times to find a place to park, under this plan, you’re going to get tolled every time,” Mr. Miller said, referring to the northern boundary of the tolling zone, where cameras and E-ZPass readers record every vehicle entering the district.</p><p>Some trucking companies have already told their customers to expect rate increases because of congestion pricing.</p><p>Joe Fitzpatrick, the president of Lightning Express, a light-fixture delivery service that travels frequently through Manhattan, said he will raise his prices by 2 percent, because he estimates that his fleet of eight box trucks and a few other vehicles could spend roughly $20,000 on congestion tolls this year.</p><p>Those fees could get passed on to consumers, said Margaret Magnarelli, the vice president of marketing at Baldor Specialty Foods, a food distribution company in the Bronx with thousands of clients in the city, including bars, restaurants and grocery stores.</p><p>“Restaurants and retailers are struggling to maintain staff as it is,” she said, and the tolls could spur many to raise their prices as they adjust to rising delivery costs.

But the bike path over the Queensboro Bridge, he said, can also feel treacherous. “So dangerous with all those commuters and those delivery bikes,” he said.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cam Baker/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2Q2MDU3NTQtOGY4YS01YjRhLTgwMGYtNGMzZThjZDkxYmRh"><div id="cd605754-8f8a-5b4a-800f-4c3e8cd91bda" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#cd605754-8f8a-5b4a-800f-4c3e8cd91bda"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bernard-mokam"><img alt="Bernard Mokam" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T14:44:40.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 9:44 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Mark Levine, Manhattan borough president, said he was hopeful that the tolling program would be a boon for one of Manhattan’s staples: its yellow taxis. “Our beloved, iconic yellow cabs, which have really had a brutal 10 years,” he said, “they’re going to get a boost from this, because the fee for Uber and Lyft is double what it is for yellows.” Passengers in yellow cabs will be charged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/15/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-cost.html" title="">75 cents for every trip into, out of and within the zone</a>, while passengers using ride-hailing services will be charged $1.50.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDNiZTBiZjYtYzZiOS01YTE0LWE5YzgtNjBjOWMxNmFiZTQ5"><div id="d3be0bf6-c6b9-5a14-a9c8-60c9c16abe49" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#d3be0bf6-c6b9-5a14-a9c8-60c9c16abe49"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nate-schweber"><img alt="Nate Schweber" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T14:43:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 9:43 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Steve Moon, who works in finance and parks his car in a garage near his home on the Upper West Side, said he has one worry about congestion pricing. “I’m concerned with, will it make rates for parking garages go up?” Moon, 41, said while walking south on Broadway on Sunday morning.

He said that he does not believe the tolling program will materially benefit New Yorkers, and has lost faith in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s ability to operate efficiently.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMTM4NjBjNzYtOGJiMC01NDNmLTk3YzUtYWYwNjNkZTZjNzAw"><div id="13860c76-8bb0-543f-97c5-af063de6c700" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#13860c76-8bb0-543f-97c5-af063de6c700"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bernard-mokam"><img alt="Bernard Mokam" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T14:12:59.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 9:12 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>“I hope people are patient to see the benefits,” said Sproule Love, 53, of Harlem, as the program kicked off late last night. “It mystifies me that drivers don’t get they will have less traffic to deal with,” he added.

But the idea was born in New York City in the 1950s.</p><p><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1996/vickrey/biographical/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Vickrey</a>, an economics professor at Columbia University who won the Nobel Prize in 1996, has been called the “father of congestion pricing.” He proposed the use of economic incentives to better manage crowded roads — as well as the packed subway system.</p><div><p>As early as 1952, Mr. Vickrey recommended charging higher fares on the New York City subway for the most crowded times and sections. “Just like hotels charge more during Christmas, and planes charge more for longer flights, he said the subways ought to do that,” said Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner and a longtime proponent of congestion pricing.</p><p>But congestion pricing for the subway did not catch on. City leaders “considered it risky, and the technology was not ready,” according to a <a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/faculty/in-memoriam/william-vickrey-1914-1996/#:~:text=Vickrey%20is%20the%20father%20of,the%20technology%20was%20not%20ready." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1997 report in the Columbia University Record</a>.</p><p>Mr. Vickrey later turned his attention to the city’s perpetual gridlock. He called for varying road tolls to reduce congestion during peak times and keep traffic flowing.</p><p>In the late 1970s, Mr. Vickrey used to show up at public meetings and push for congestion pricing, said Mr. Schwartz, who was an assistant city traffic commissioner back then. “He pestered me,” Mr. Schwartz said. “He kept saying a lot of our approach to traffic congestion wouldn’t work — and that we had to use pricing.”</p><p>Though Mr. Vickrey died in 1996, his idea has lived on. Mr. Schwartz and many others — including business, civic, and transportation and environmental advocates — have fought for decades to bring congestion pricing to New York’s streets.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/nyregion/23mayorcnd.html" title="">In 2007</a>, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed a congestion-pricing plan as part of his efforts to improve the environment. But the plan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/nyregion/08congest.html" title="">faltered the next year</a> in Albany amid staunch opposition from state legislators.</p><p>A decade later, facing a breakdown in subway service, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/nyregion/cuomo-rethinks-opposition-to-tolls-to-ease-manhattan-traffic.html" title="">resurrected congestion pricing</a> to finance repairs to the aging subway system. “Congestion pricing is an idea whose time has come,” he said at that time. (Mr. Cuomo has since questioned whether it is the right time to start congestion pricing.)</p><p>It was another two years before congestion pricing was finally approved by the State Legislature in 2019 as part of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">state budget</a>.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
