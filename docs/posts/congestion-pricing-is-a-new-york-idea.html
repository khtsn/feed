Most drivers crossing into the heart of Manhattan are now being charged $9 by E-ZPass readers and cameras set up along the new tolling zone, which runs from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan.</p><p>These are some of the most traffic-saturated streets in the world, where cars crawl along at under 5 m.p.h. during rush hour in Midtown. Transportation leaders hope the new tolls persuade more motorists to leave their cars behind and take mass transit instead. </p><div><p>The tolls will help finance crucial repairs and improvements to New York City’s aging subway system, buses, and two commuter rail lines. </p><p>A few New Yorkers were eager to hit the streets to mark the start of the tolling program, which began just after midnight on Sunday. </p><p>Supporters chanted, “Pay that toll! Pay that toll!” while critics banged a cowbell.</p><p>Noel Hidalgo, 45, who lives in Brooklyn, was among the first drivers to pay the new toll. As he drove his Mini Cooper across the threshold, toll supporters cheered and clapped from the curb.</p><p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the program, said the tolls were started on Sunday to be able to work out any kinks on a day when traffic is lighter than usual.</p><p>Hours into the program, there were no reports of any major problems, according to the M.T.A. Still, many streets were mostly empty on a freezing Sunday right after the holidays, with the real test for the tolling program yet to come during the workweek.</p><p>Here’s how the program works:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Where will drivers be charged?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How much will the tolls cost?</strong></p><p>Those driving smaller commercial trucks and some buses will pay a toll of $14.40 at peak hours and $3.60 at other times. Drivers of larger trucks and tour buses will be charged $21.60 at peak hours and $5.40 off-peak.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are there exemptions, credits or discounts?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Are the tolls a done deal?</strong></p><p>Opponents in New Jersey and New York have also fought the tolls for more than a year through litigation that could stop the program even after it has begun. But federal judges have recently ruled against the plan’s opponents in several lawsuits.</p></li></ul><p>Bernard Mokam<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="45" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZGEwZDQ0ZjYtNmJlMi01NWZlLTlmZWItZjAwY2U2NzE3YmVh"><div id="da0d44f6-6be2-55fe-9feb-f00ce6717bea" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#da0d44f6-6be2-55fe-9feb-f00ce6717bea"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/wesley-parnell"><img alt="Wesley Parnell" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/15/reader-center/author-wesley-parnell/author-wesley-parnell-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/15/reader-center/author-wesley-parnell/author-wesley-parnell-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/15/reader-center/author-wesley-parnell/author-wesley-parnell-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T15:56:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 10:56 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/wesley-parnell" itemprop="name">Wesley Parnell</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from New Jersey</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>It will be interesting to see how commuters might try to get around the toll in the coming months and how law enforcement will crack down.

The fee falls to $2.25 in off-peak hours. But trucks entering the zone at busy times will pay up to $21.60, based on size and time of entry, with no cap on the number of tolls per day.</p><p>That could add up quickly for thousands of trucks entering the zone several times a day, said Zach Miller, the vice president of government affairs for the Trucking Association of New York, a statewide trade group. Trucks deliver nearly 90 percent of all goods within the five boroughs.</p><p>“If you’re circling 59th Street three times to find a place to park, under this plan, you’re going to get tolled every time,” Mr. Miller said, referring to the northern boundary of the tolling zone, where cameras and E-ZPass readers record every vehicle entering the district.</p><p>Some trucking companies have already told their customers to expect rate increases because of congestion pricing.</p><p>Joe Fitzpatrick, the president of Lightning Express, a light-fixture delivery service that travels frequently through Manhattan, said he will raise his prices by 2 percent, because he estimates that his fleet of eight box trucks and a few other vehicles could spend roughly $20,000 on congestion tolls this year.</p><p>Those fees could get passed on to consumers, said Margaret Magnarelli, the vice president of marketing at Baldor Specialty Foods, a food distribution company in the Bronx with thousands of clients in the city, including bars, restaurants and grocery stores.</p><p>“Restaurants and retailers are struggling to maintain staff as it is,” she said, and the tolls could spur many to raise their prices as they adjust to rising delivery costs. Her company and a group of other food businesses are lobbying Gov. Kathy Hochul to carve out a tolling exemption for truck drivers.</p><p>Tom Wright, the president of the nonprofit Regional Plan Association, said that such arguments play down the positive effects of congestion pricing, which could ultimately save the trucking industry money.</p><p>A <a href="https://pfnyc.org/research/100-billion-cost-of-traffic-congestion-in-metro-new-york/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2018 study</a> by the Partnership for New York City, a business group, found that the annual cost of delays in commuting and work-related travel in the New York City area was $9.2 billion.</p><p>For the trucking industry, he said, the time savings from reduced congestion “vastly outweighs the cost.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="34" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTdhOWQ4MzUtODdmOC01Njg4LThlNWMtZWI5MjZiMzc2Zjky"><div id="a7a9d835-87f8-5688-8e5c-eb926b376f92" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#a7a9d835-87f8-5688-8e5c-eb926b376f92"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karsten-moran"><img alt="Karsten Moran" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T15:23:00.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 10:23 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karsten-moran" itemprop="name">Karsten Moran</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>Google Maps included warnings about congestion pricing on Sunday while displaying directions into Midtown Manhattan south of 60th Street.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="33" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad2"><div id="ad-2" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="32" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvODQyNDY3MzctNjUwNS01ZDU4LWIxMGYtNTA4NjFmOWUzYjFi"><div id="84246737-6505-5d58-b10f-50861f9e3b1b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#84246737-6505-5d58-b10f-50861f9e3b1b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sean-piccoli"><img alt="Sean Piccoli" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T15:15:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 10:15 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sean-piccoli" itemprop="name">Sean Piccoli</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Manhattan</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Ana Brandao leaned against the Q60 bus stop sign at the base of the Queensboro Bridge at 60th Street in Manhattan, on her way to church in Queens.

Martinez, a Queens resident who works in the fashion industry, said he was not happy with the start of congestion pricing. “I feel like it’s another way of the city of getting revenue and not really being justified for it, because they already charge a lot for a lot of services,” he said. “But I feel there’s a lot of waste.” Martinez said he rides his bicycle to work in part because he finds public transportation unreliable and he worries about safety on the subway. But the bike path over the Queensboro Bridge, he said, can also feel treacherous. “So dangerous with all those commuters and those delivery bikes,” he said.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cam Baker/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2Q2MDU3NTQtOGY4YS01YjRhLTgwMGYtNGMzZThjZDkxYmRh"><div id="cd605754-8f8a-5b4a-800f-4c3e8cd91bda" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#cd605754-8f8a-5b4a-800f-4c3e8cd91bda"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bernard-mokam"><img alt="Bernard Mokam" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T14:44:40.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 9:44 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bernard-mokam" itemprop="name">Bernard Mokam</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>Mark Levine, Manhattan borough president, said he was hopeful that the tolling program would be a boon for one of Manhattan’s staples: its yellow taxis. “Our beloved, iconic yellow cabs, which have really had a brutal 10 years,” he said, “they’re going to get a boost from this, because the fee for Uber and Lyft is double what it is for yellows.” Passengers in yellow cabs will be charged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/15/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-cost.html" title="">75 cents for every trip into, out of and within the zone</a>, while passengers using ride-hailing services will be charged $1.50.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad3"><div id="ad-3" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="27" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDNiZTBiZjYtYzZiOS01YTE0LWE5YzgtNjBjOWMxNmFiZTQ5"><div id="d3be0bf6-c6b9-5a14-a9c8-60c9c16abe49" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#d3be0bf6-c6b9-5a14-a9c8-60c9c16abe49"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nate-schweber"><img alt="Nate Schweber" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T14:43:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 9:43 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nate-schweber" itemprop="name">Nate Schweber</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Manhattan</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Steve Moon, who works in finance and parks his car in a garage near his home on the Upper West Side, said he has one worry about congestion pricing. “I’m concerned with, will it make rates for parking garages go up?” Moon, 41, said while walking south on Broadway on Sunday morning.

Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner and a longtime proponent of congestion pricing.</p><p>But congestion pricing for the subway did not catch on. City leaders “considered it risky, and the technology was not ready,” according to a <a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/faculty/in-memoriam/william-vickrey-1914-1996/#:~:text=Vickrey%20is%20the%20father%20of,the%20technology%20was%20not%20ready." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1997 report in the Columbia University Record</a>.</p><p>Mr. Vickrey later turned his attention to the city’s perpetual gridlock. He called for varying road tolls to reduce congestion during peak times and keep traffic flowing.</p><p>In the late 1970s, Mr. Vickrey used to show up at public meetings and push for congestion pricing, said Mr. Schwartz, who was an assistant city traffic commissioner back then. “He pestered me,” Mr. Schwartz said. “He kept saying a lot of our approach to traffic congestion wouldn’t work — and that we had to use pricing.”</p><p>Though Mr. Vickrey died in 1996, his idea has lived on. Mr. Schwartz and many others — including business, civic, and transportation and environmental advocates — have fought for decades to bring congestion pricing to New York’s streets.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/nyregion/23mayorcnd.html" title="">In 2007</a>, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed a congestion-pricing plan as part of his efforts to improve the environment. But the plan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/nyregion/08congest.html" title="">faltered the next year</a> in Albany amid staunch opposition from state legislators.</p><p>A decade later, facing a breakdown in subway service, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/nyregion/cuomo-rethinks-opposition-to-tolls-to-ease-manhattan-traffic.html" title="">resurrected congestion pricing</a> to finance repairs to the aging subway system. “Congestion pricing is an idea whose time has come,” he said at that time. (Mr. Cuomo has since questioned whether it is the right time to start congestion pricing.)</p><p>It was another two years before congestion pricing was finally approved by the State Legislature in 2019 as part of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">state budget</a>.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMjY2OGEzNjktYzg1Ni01MTNiLWI4MTUtNWE0NDUyMjQwNDM0"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad7"><div id="ad-7" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid8">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNTVkNzU2MDMtOWI3NC01NzY1LTgxZTktY2YyM2Q4MzhlYjc5"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNWFmMTIwZjYtMjZlYy01ZjlkLWIxYjktNjI1NjM0N2U0Y2Y3"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDJlZjRkMDQtZWYxMy01M2VkLThlOTUtMWU1NTRiMDViYzJi"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjFmNDU1ZDUtZjg4Mi01YTFjLWJhOGYtZWRiYmYwZjFiNTdm"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad8"><div id="ad-8" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid9">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-loadmore43"></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYmIwMjVkMzctNjE1My01ZjlmLWJmZDItODRlNzlkYmVkYjQ1"><div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNDg4NDM3YzgtYjQzMi01ODE0LWE4YzItOGJlNzQ5OTljODk3"><div></div></div></section></div></div>
