The plan will help generate $15 billion for crucial upgrades to the region’s mass transit system.</p><p>Groups of observers gathered at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 60th Street to mark the start of the tolling program, which began just after midnight on Sunday.</p><p>Supporters chanted, “Pay that toll! Pay that toll!” while critics banged a cowbell.</p><p>Noel Hidalgo, 45, who lives in Brooklyn, was among the first drivers to pay the new toll. As he drove his Mini Cooper across the threshold, other supporters cheered and clapped from the curb.</p><p>Congestion pricing had been halted abruptly in June when Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York stopped it just weeks before its original start date. At the time, Ms. Hochul expressed concerns that the tolls would negatively affect New York’s economy, an idea that was disputed by some experts. She later revived the politically unpopular program one week after November’s general election, this time with reduced tolls that are scheduled to increase in the years to come.</p><p>Here’s how the program works:</p><ul><li><p><strong>When did the tolling start?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Where will drivers be charged?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How will drivers be billed?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How much will the tolls cost?</strong></p><p>Motorcyclists will pay $4.50 during peak hours and $1.05 off-peak.</p><p>Those driving smaller commercial trucks and some buses will pay a toll of $14.40 at peak hours and $3.60 at other times. Drivers of larger trucks and tour buses will be charged $21.60 at peak hours and $5.40 off-peak.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are there exemptions, credits or discounts?</strong></p><p>During peak hours, drivers of passenger vehicles who enter Manhattan via four tunnels that already require tolls — the Lincoln, Holland, Hugh L. Carey and Queens-Midtown — will receive a credit of up to $3 against the daily congestion charge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are the tolls a done deal?</strong></p><p>Opponents in New Jersey and New York have also fought the tolls for more than a year through litigation that could stop the program even after it has begun. But federal judges have recently ruled against the plan’s opponents in several lawsuits.</p></li></ul><p>Bernard Mokam<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="35" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTdhOWQ4MzUtODdmOC01Njg4LThlNWMtZWI5MjZiMzc2Zjky"><div id="a7a9d835-87f8-5688-8e5c-eb926b376f92" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#a7a9d835-87f8-5688-8e5c-eb926b376f92"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karsten-moran"><img alt="Karsten Moran" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T15:23:00.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 10:23 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Google Maps included warnings about congestion pricing on Sunday while displaying directions into Midtown Manhattan south of 60th Street.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="34" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvODQyNDY3MzctNjUwNS01ZDU4LWIxMGYtNTA4NjFmOWUzYjFi"><div id="84246737-6505-5d58-b10f-50861f9e3b1b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#84246737-6505-5d58-b10f-50861f9e3b1b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sean-piccoli"><img alt="Sean Piccoli" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T15:15:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 10:15 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Ana Brandao leaned against the Q60 bus stop sign at the base of the Queensboro Bridge at 60th Street in Manhattan, on her way to church in Queens.

She offered a guarded appraisal of congestion pricing. “If they’re really going to raise money for the subways and buses, that would be fine,” Brandao said. “And it would help with the congestion.” Asked if she was hopeful that it would do that, Brandao smiled and let out a long, ambivalent-sounding “Yeah.” She added: “I mean, if it doesn’t hurt us that use public transportation.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="33" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-Capsule3"><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="31" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNzgzOWMxMTYtZjhmYi01YzRkLThlMmItODMxZGI3NzYyZWU2"><div id="7839c116-f8fb-5c4d-8e2b-831db7762ee6" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#7839c116-f8fb-5c4d-8e2b-831db7762ee6"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Anusha Bayya" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T15:11:55.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 10:11 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><span itemprop="name">Anusha Bayya</span></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Queens</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Bob Steig, 78, was one of the last drivers to get what he termed the final “free ride” into the city when he passed over the Queensboro Bridge on his way to Brooklyn around 11:30 p.m. Saturday night.

Martinez, a Queens resident who works in the fashion industry, said he was not happy with the start of congestion pricing. “I feel like it’s another way of the city of getting revenue and not really being justified for it, because they already charge a lot for a lot of services,” he said. “But I feel there’s a lot of waste.” Martinez said he rides his bicycle to work in part because he finds public transportation unreliable and he worries about safety on the subway. But the bike path over the Queensboro Bridge, he said, can also feel treacherous. “So dangerous with all those commuters and those delivery bikes,” he said.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cam Baker/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2Q2MDU3NTQtOGY4YS01YjRhLTgwMGYtNGMzZThjZDkxYmRh"><div id="cd605754-8f8a-5b4a-800f-4c3e8cd91bda" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#cd605754-8f8a-5b4a-800f-4c3e8cd91bda"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bernard-mokam"><img alt="Bernard Mokam" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/05/reader-center/author-Bernard-Mokam/author-Bernard-Mokam-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T14:44:40.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 9:44 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Mark Levine, Manhattan borough president, said he was hopeful that the tolling program would be a boon for one of Manhattan’s staples: its yellow taxis. “Our beloved, iconic yellow cabs, which have really had a brutal 10 years,” he said, “they’re going to get a boost from this, because the fee for Uber and Lyft is double what it is for yellows.” Passengers in yellow cabs will be charged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/15/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-cost.html" title="">75 cents for every trip into, out of and within the zone</a>, while passengers using ride-hailing services will be charged $1.50.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZDNiZTBiZjYtYzZiOS01YTE0LWE5YzgtNjBjOWMxNmFiZTQ5"><div id="d3be0bf6-c6b9-5a14-a9c8-60c9c16abe49" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#d3be0bf6-c6b9-5a14-a9c8-60c9c16abe49"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nate-schweber"><img alt="Nate Schweber" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/multimedia/author-nate-schweber/author-nate-schweber-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T14:43:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 9:43 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Steve Moon, who works in finance and parks his car in a garage near his home on the Upper West Side, said he has one worry about congestion pricing. “I’m concerned with, will it make rates for parking garages go up?” Moon, 41, said while walking south on Broadway on Sunday morning.

He called for varying road tolls to reduce congestion during peak times and keep traffic flowing.</p><p>In the late 1970s, Mr. Vickrey used to show up at public meetings and push for congestion pricing, said Mr. Schwartz, who was an assistant city traffic commissioner back then. “He pestered me,” Mr. Schwartz said. “He kept saying a lot of our approach to traffic congestion wouldn’t work — and that we had to use pricing.”</p><p>Though Mr. Vickrey died in 1996, his idea has lived on. Mr. Schwartz and many others — including business, civic, and transportation and environmental advocates — have fought for decades to bring congestion pricing to New York’s streets.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/nyregion/23mayorcnd.html" title="">In 2007</a>, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed a congestion-pricing plan as part of his efforts to improve the environment. But the plan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/nyregion/08congest.html" title="">faltered the next year</a> in Albany amid staunch opposition from state legislators.</p><p>A decade later, facing a breakdown in subway service, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/nyregion/cuomo-rethinks-opposition-to-tolls-to-ease-manhattan-traffic.html" title="">resurrected congestion pricing</a> to finance repairs to the aging subway system. “Congestion pricing is an idea whose time has come,” he said at that time. (Mr. Cuomo has since questioned whether it is the right time to start congestion pricing.)</p><p>It was another two years before congestion pricing was finally approved by the State Legislature in 2019 as part of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">state budget</a>.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMjY2OGEzNjktYzg1Ni01MTNiLWI4MTUtNWE0NDUyMjQwNDM0"><div id="2668a369-c856-513b-b815-5a4452240434" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-new-jersey#2668a369-c856-513b-b815-5a4452240434"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Anusha Bayya" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T13:39:04.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 8:39 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><span itemprop="name">Anusha Bayya</span></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Queens</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Good morning — I’m Anusha Bayya, reporting from Hunters Point Avenue in Queens, near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. </p></div><div><div id="" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url=""><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Anusha Bayya" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/reader-center/author-anusha-bayya/author-anusha-bayya-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-05T13:39:48.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 5, 2025, 8:39 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><span itemprop="name">Anusha Bayya</span></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Queens</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Cars, taxis and trucks zip past black signs with scrolling orange writing on their way into Manhattan via the tunnel.
