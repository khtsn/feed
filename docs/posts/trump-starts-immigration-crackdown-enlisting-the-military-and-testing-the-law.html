One, plunged about 30,000 migrants who had existing appointments to enter the United States into limbo, and indicated that it would now be far more difficult.</p><p>Hours later in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump moved to block asylum seekers and seal the border against those looking for protection in the United States. The Trump administration argued the illegal border crossings posed a national security and public health concern. Rather than citing a specific threat of disease, Mr. Trump simply said that migrants did not provide border authorities with “comprehensive health information,” posing a public health risk.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
