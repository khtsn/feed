    <h1>What We Know About the Ship Finland Seized Over Fears of Russian Sabotage</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A day after the Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker suspected of severing vital undersea cables, NATO <a href="https://x.com/SecGenNATO" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Friday that it would step up security in northern seas and the European Union threatened new sanctions against Russia amid growing concern about a covert campaign to sabotage European infrastructure.</p><p>The authorities in Finland said they had confiscated material from onboard the ship, the Eagle S, an aging oil tanker registered in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific. The vessel is being held under police and naval guard in the Gulf of Finland, the police said on Friday.</p><p>The authorities said the tanker might be part of Russia’s “shadow fleet,” which President Vladimir V. Putin has used to circumvent Western-imposed sanctions on Russian oil exports and to conduct acts of sabotage.</p><p>The five cables, including a cable that carries power from Finland to Estonia, as well as <a href="https://traficom.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/traficom-mukana-selvittamassa-suomenlahden-kaapelivaurioita" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four other cables</a> carrying data were damaged before the tanker was seized on Thursday. An analyst said the use of such tankers to intentionally sabotage European infrastructure would be an unusual escalation by Russia.</p></div></div>
