One in 50 U.S. women <a href="https://surveillance.cancer.gov/devcan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will develop invasive breast cancer</a> by the age of 50, the authors said, based on National Cancer Institute calculations.</p><p>The sharpest increases in young adults by age during the decade were among women in their 20s, whose rate increased by about 2.2 percent a year, though their absolute risk remains very low, at about 6.5 per 100,000 women. </p><p>Among Asian American/Pacific Islander women, who historically also have had a low prevalence of the disease, rates increased by 2.7 percent a year among those under 50, and by 2.5 percent a year among older women.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Cancer is generally considered a disease of aging, and that hasn’t changed: The vast majority of breast cancer cases and deaths still occur among older women. But the new study is one of several documenting a troubling uptick in malignancies among younger Americans.</p><p>These so-called early-onset cancers pose special challenges. Striking in early adulthood or midlife, they tend to be aggressive yet are often missed because they are not expected, and routine screenings are aimed at older adults.</p><p>That has been changing somewhat. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/health/breast-cancer-mammography-ultrasound.html" title="">lowered the age for initiating mammography to 40</a> from 50, reversing an earlier decision to raise the screening age. The American Cancer Society recommends starting annual mammography screening at 45 for women at average risk, with the option of starting at 40.</p><p>Despite the rise in incidence, deaths from breast cancer have plunged, dropping by about 10 percent in the last decade and by 44 percent in the past three decades because of improved screening and treatments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A portrait of Dani Alderman, who sits on a gray couch in an apartment and rests her head and hands on the couch&#39;s back." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/01/multimedia/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb/01breast-cancer-05-jgzb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dani Alderman, 31, in her apartment in Chelsea.

Breast cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer deaths among Black women, who have a 38 percent higher death rate than white women.</p><p>Black women are more frequently diagnosed with certain kinds of tumors that are more difficult to treat. A recent Mass General Brigham study found that <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.23.02311" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Black women are also more likely than white women</a> to die of all types of breast cancer, suggesting that other factors are playing roles, like delays in diagnosis and difficulty finding timely quality care.</p><p>“The bottom line is, we need to improve access to high-quality screening and high-quality treatment for all women of color, especially to Black and Native American women,” said Rebecca L. Siegel, an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society and senior author of the report. “We need to expand that progress to all women.”</p><p>Some 310,720 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in U.S. women this year, including 13,180 cases in women under 40 and 37,650 in women in their 40s, the paper estimated.

Ms. Delaney, 34, said she herself did not feel particular urgency because she was young and had no breast cancer in her family. (In fact, most women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have the cancer in their family.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The biggest thing I realized during this whole entire process is that there’s no age limit on this,” said Ms. Delaney, who lives in Los Angeles and is in remission after treatment last year with chemotherapy, radiation and surgery for Stage II breast cancer. “Maybe there used to be, but I really feel there isn’t anymore.”</p><p>It took even longer for Jeanelle Adams, 36, who is Black and Puerto Rican, to be diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, a subtype that is especially hard to treat because it is not driven by estrogen, progesterone or another hormone, human epidermal growth factor 2.</p><p>Her first symptoms were unusual: a rash on the left breast, which had a dimpled appearance (“like an orange”), and fluid leaking from the nipple. Doctors thought it was eczema, and getting the right diagnosis took Ms. Adams two years, even though she was convinced that something more serious was going on.</p><p>Like many other women, Ms. Adams, who is married and lives in North New Jersey, does not have the typical risk factors. She has a 10-year-old daughter whom she breastfed for more than two years; she eats lots of vegetables, has always been physically active and is not overweight.</p><p>She suspects environmental factors are at play, though research is sparse. “I work out constantly, I don’t put chemicals in my hair,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Among women of all ages overall, localized cancers — invasive tumors that have not spread beyond the breast to other parts of the body — accounted for most of the increase in incidence. </p><p>Most of the increase was in tumors fueled by the hormones estrogen or progesterone. Among women under 50, the rates increased for diagnoses at every stage of cancer.</p><p>Changes in women’s reproductive lives are believed to be driving some of the increase, said Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, a co-author of the report and senior vice president of surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society.</p><p>More women are delaying childbearing, and they are having fewer children or no children at all. Many are not breastfeeding, which is believed protective. Earlier menstruation is a risk, as is late menopause.</p><p>All of these factors increase a woman&#39;s exposure to the body’s estrogen and progesterone, hormones made by the ovaries that can stimulate cell growth. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Obesity, which has become more common among Americans, also raises the odds of breast cancer for postmenopausal women ages 50 and older. Being physically active and eating a healthy diet may help prevent the disease, experts say, while alcohol consumption and binge drinking increase the risk, accounting for more breast cancer cases than does obesity, Ms. Siegel said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Adams, with her daughter, does not have the typical risk factors: She eats lots of vegetables, has always been physically active and is not overweight.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jackie Molloy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Far less is known about the role that environmental factors may play, including the effects of chemicals that mimic hormones, such as phthalates (used in many fragrances and personal care products), and that leach from food packaging.</p><p>Dani Alderman, 31, who lives in New York City, found out at age 27 that she had inherited a genetic mutation that raised her risk of breast and ovarian cancer. She started getting screened regularly, but doctors assured her that, even with her mutation, the risk was very small before age 30.</p><p>A week before her 30th birthday, however, a scan picked up something that turned out to be cancer. </p><p>“It’s really alarming,” Ms. Alderman said. “I have the gene, but something makes the gene express itself. I exercise five days a week, I don’t really drink alcohol, and I eat healthy. Is it the microplastics? The processed food? I think there must be something in the environment.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Roni Caryn Rabin is a Times health reporter focused on maternal and child health, racial and economic disparities in health care, and the influence of money on medicine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin">More about Roni Caryn Rabin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/american-cancer-society">American Cancer Society</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/01/health/breast-cancer-young-women.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/01/health/breast-cancer-young-women.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Fight Against Cancer</h2><hr/><ul><li><p>A new report described <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/health/alcohol-cancer-young-adults.html">deep links between alcohol and cancer</a>, as scientists continue to rethink the idea that moderate drinking offers health benefits.</p></li><li><p>An estimated 13% of all cancer cases globally are linked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/well/cancer-infections-vaccines-treatments.html">four common infections</a>, according to researchers.</p></li><li><p>After a cancer diagnosis, finding an oncologist is one of the most important decisions you’ll make. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/well/cancer-diagnosis-oncologist.html">Here’s how to find the right one for you</a>.</p></li><li><p>Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer.
