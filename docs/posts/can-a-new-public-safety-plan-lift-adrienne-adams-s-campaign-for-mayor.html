She trails badly in fund-raising efforts and has yet to qualify for the city’s generous matching-funds program.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/nyregion/adrienne-adams-endorsements-nyc-mayor.html" title="">backed by major unions</a> like District Council 37 and the state attorney general, Letitia James, Ms. Adams is seeking to present herself as a seasoned, drama-free leader who might appeal to voters seeking a moderate Democrat other than the current front-runner, the former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.</p><p>A <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/nyc-mayors-race-may-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marist poll released</a> on Wednesday found her rising to third place with 11 percent, still far behind Mr. Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, a progressive state lawmaker.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We have to remember that traditionally in New York, mayoral races tend to break very late<em>,” </em>Ms. Adams said, citing the trajectory of the former sanitation commissioner Kathyrn Garcia, who placed second in the 2021 primary. “I am still very excited about this race, and I intend to win it.”</p><p>Other candidates have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/21/nyregion/nyc-mayor-democratic-candidates-issues.html#public-safety" title="">released</a> their public safety plans.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo has said he would hire 5,000 more police officers. Mr. Mamdani said he would create a Department of Community Safety to deal with issues such as mental illness and homelessness to free up officers. Brad Lander, the city comptroller, said he would retain Jessica Tisch as police commissioner and focus on ending street homelessness.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/nyregion/adrienne-adams-council-speaker.html" title="">Leaning on her background</a> as a corporate trainer and her collaborative management style, Ms. Adams said she wanted to focus more on helping crime victims, strengthen efforts to prevent crime through community-based violence interruption programs and address issues that lead to crime by investing in parks, after school programs and employment opportunities for young people.</p><p>She said she would combat retail theft by treating it as organized crime, focusing on the ringleaders while providing services for those who commit the thefts if they are mentally ill or addicted to drugs.</p><p>“New York can’t truly be safe until every neighborhood feels safe day or night,” Ms. Adams said in an interview. “That kind of safety depends on a strong Police Department that our communities can trust and that our communities can count on, but we know that’s not what we have right now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Adams, who previously served as chair of the Council’s public safety committee, joined with some council members to call for cutting $1 billion from the Police Department’s budget in 2020, in the wake of protests over the murder of George Floyd.</p><p>Ms. Adams said she was concerned about police overtime costs and wanted more resources to go to methods of improving public safety that did not involve law enforcement.</p><p>She has faced criticism from the Police Benevolent Association and a few council members for supporting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/nyregion/nypd-how-many-stops-act.html" title="">How Many Stops Act</a>. Robert Holden, a conservative Democrat, opposed the legislation as “unnecessary” and voted against overriding the mayor’s veto.</p><p>“You’d rather have cops making reports than out on patrol?” he said.</p><p>Ms. Adams, he said, has been a sponsor on legislation that he believes has caused many officers to flee the department, such as the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/police-new-york-city-chokeholds-breathing-b35a07662eb1be873b77789346142056" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ban on chokeholds</a>. Ms. Adams has sided with the “far left” members of the City Council on policing too often, he added.</p><p>Ms. Adams said her plan called for her to act as an advocate for police officers because they shared the goal of protecting the public. The How Many Stops Act was about helping to restore public trust in the department, which would be one of her main goals as mayor, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There is still a fear of the N.Y.P.D.,” said Ms. Adams, the city’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/nyregion/adrienne-adams-city-council-speaker.html" title="">first Black Council speaker</a>. “There is still that talk that I had to have with my children and that my children have had to have with their children.”</p><p>Aqeela Sherrills, the co-founder and leader of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, has worked with Ms. Adams and was impressed by her plan’s focus on viewing public safety as a public health issue.</p><p>“Community violence intervention is a complementary strategy to policing,” Mr. Sherrills said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>May 15, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article described incorrectly Adrienne Adams’s stance on Police Department funding in 2020. She called for cutting $1 billion from the department’s budget; she did not decline to join lawmakers who supported that position.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Jeffery C.
