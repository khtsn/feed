Before she could get her 10-year-old daughter into the basement, the winds began.</p><p>On Saturday morning, she surveyed the damage in her community from one of several tornadoes that tore across the nation since late Friday, killing at least 23 people. Pieces of her neighbor’s roof were in her backyard. There were dozens of jagged tree limbs and trunks in her community garden. And at a nearby church, the bell tower had crumbled into dusty piles of bricks and stones.</p><p>“This poor neighborhood,” Ms. Lammert said. “I don’t know how we will come back.”</p><p>And that was only a fraction of the destruction left after tornadoes ripped through homes and killed people in at least three states: Missouri, Kentucky and Virginia. Officials warned the death toll could rise as they assessed the damage on Saturday, and dozens more were injured.</p><p>The spring tornado season has been especially brutal in this part of the country, coming just weeks after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/03/weather/midwest-storms-tornado#cad02817-2179-5974-a542-55720689d25f" title="">similar storms</a> caused deadly devastation in the region. On Friday, these tornadoes were caused by a major storm over the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Kentucky, at least 14 people were killed, Gov. Andy Beshear said on Saturday morning. The governor is expected to tour the damage in Laurel County, about 90 miles south of Lexington, later on Saturday. The sheriff’s department there sent staff to the Faith Assembly Church in London, Ky., to help people trying to locate a loved one.</p><p>“All of our resources are now focused on rescue efforts,” he said in a post on social media. “Please pray for the families affected.”</p><p>The Kentucky National Guard was mobilized along with emergency medical workers to treat the injured and assess the damage, the agency said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Kentucky’s emergency management agency <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KentuckyEM/?locale=en_GB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> “a more complete, and more painful picture” emerging, saying that hundreds of Kentuckians had lost their homes or suffered property damage. And emergency crews were at work in the area near London-Corbin Airport, which was hit around midnight Friday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The state is also still struggling to recover from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/us/kentucky-storm-damage.html" title="">flooding in February</a>, with two dozen more counties just approved on Wednesday for federal aid. This week’s storm comes at a precarious moment for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/climate/trump-cuts-hud-disaster-recovery.html" title="">disaster relief</a> efforts, as sweeping staffing and funding cuts have upended the usual processes for getting assistance from the federal government.</p><p>Across the border in Missouri, the tornadoes killed at least seven people, five of them in St. Louis, and injured dozens more. A tornado also killed two people in Scott County, in southeastern Missouri, according to the county sheriff’s office.</p><p>In St. Louis, cellphone towers were taken out and traffic lights were down, city authorities said, and there was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/weather/storms-missouri-kentucky-indiana-illinois.html" title="">severe damage</a> to homes and buildings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-storms-plgc/17xp-storms-plgc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-storms-plgc/17xp-storms-plgc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-storms-plgc/17xp-storms-plgc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A blue sky with puffy clouds can be seen behind trees that were ripped apart by a storm." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-storms-plgc/17xp-storms-plgc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-storms-plgc/17xp-storms-plgc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-storms-plgc/17xp-storms-plgc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-storms-plgc/17xp-storms-plgc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7882c6e6-c663-5eb2-80cf-d7143ce2f8b3" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Downed trees on Friday in St. Louis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Phillis/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Last night it was sirens and power chain saws — that’s what I went to sleep to last night,” said Paul Rhodes, 82, as he searched for a place to charge his phone after high winds took out the power at his home Friday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As sirens rang out on Friday in nearby Forest Park, a nearly 1,300-acre public park that houses several of the city’s cultural sites, workers quickly hustled visitors off the grounds and the handball court into a basement until the wind died down.
