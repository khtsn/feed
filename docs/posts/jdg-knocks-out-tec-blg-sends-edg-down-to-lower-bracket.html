</span> faced off in the middle bracket. JDG and BLG were the victors of the day, each winning their matches in 2-1 fashion.</p>



<p>Coming into this match, JDG had won their past six encounters in a row against TEC over the course of the past two years, including both teams&#39; opening game in this tournament. JDG came out on top 2-1, keeping themselves alive in the lower bracket and extending that win streak to seven. </p>

<p>JDG chose to open on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598945/titan-esports-club-vs-jdg-esports-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr2/?game=245274&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, but TEC made it look like their own map pick as <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5011/abo">
		Abo	</a>
</span> completely took over the game on Chamber. On their attack side, he constantly found opening picks by himself around the map, racking up 17 kills in a 10-2 half. </p>

<p><em>Abo was a nightmare for JDG on Bind.</em></p>

<p>JDG attempted to mount a comeback off of a bonus round win, but Abo shut it down immediately with a hero rifle in the eco round, allowing TEC to close out the map 13-5. Abo finished with 23 kills, and 1.85 rating, and an unbelievable 9-0 FK/FD record. </p>

<p>The next map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598945/titan-esports-club-vs-jdg-esports-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr2/?game=245275&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>. The first half was back-and-forth as both teams traded rounds, with a pistol round making the difference for JDG as they ended up 7-5 at halftime. From there, TEC stayed hot on JDG&#39;s heels but were never able to take the lead for themselves; two 3Ks from <span data-ref-id="5">

</span> at the end secured a 13-10 JDG victory. </p>

<p><em>JDG breaks through the Viper&#39;s Pit to close out Haven.</em></p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598945/titan-esports-club-vs-jdg-esports-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr2/?game=245276&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>, JDG immediately took the reins, winning ten rounds in a row off of the starting line. TEC tried breaking through on all parts of the map, but nothing seemed to go right for them as they ran headfirst into JDG&#39;s defensive setups. </p>

<p>TEC began to put together rounds in the second after a pistol and a bonus, closing the gap to 11-8 largely thanks to an impressive 16/3 defense side performance by <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/42235/dynamite">
		Dynamite	</a>
</span> on Yoru. However, JDG eventually found the gap on the B site and exploited it with fast hits to win 13-8, eliminating TEC from Kickoff.</p>



<p>After losses in the upper bracket, two of the region&#39;s most frequent top dogs and international representatives in BLG and EDG found each other in the middle bracket for their fifteenth all-time match-up. Historically, the record went 10-4 in favor of EDG, but BLG came out better in the 2025 season with three wins out of four encounters.</p>

<p>The match started on BLG&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598939/edward-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mr3/?game=245254&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>, where they brought out a Breach-Tejo composition against EDG&#39;s Jett and Yoru. BLG started up 4-1, but a Blade Storm entry in an eco round from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> gave EDG a way back in, with the half ending in a 6-6 deadlock.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10698/nephh">
		nephh	</a>
</span> ran rings around EDG in the second half both individually and as an IGL, going 12/3 in the half on Omen and opening up rounds with creative Mid splits. BLG&#39;s postplant utility caused even more headaches for EDG, with <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4774/knight">
		Knight	</a>
</span> on Tejo acing in the penultimate round in a 2v5 to win BLG the map 13-7.</p>

<p><em>Knight puts the nail in the coffin on Abyss with an ace.</em></p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598939/edward-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mr3/?game=245255&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>, both teams leaned into comfort with more traditional compositions. EDG ran the Yoru-Iso composition that first appeared back in 2024, while BLG went with an even more vintage lineup with Breach and Sova.</p>

<p>Starting on defense, EDG demonstrated a proactive gameplan, fighting Mid successfully three times over the course of a 9-3 half. Between EDG&#39;s aggression and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/%3Cspan%20style=" display:="" inline-block;="" position:="" relative;"="" data-ref-id="10">
	</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/39697/cb">
		cb	</a>
&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cb&#39;s Operator holding deep lines, BLG had their hands full and only found success when they managed to break through the C site. </p>

<p>BLG briefly got the momentum back on their side after winning the second round eco, but a 1v3 from <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span> in round 18 broke that momentum and spurred EDG on to a 13-9 win.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOLQrslYaTg?si=xqM3qiBvCmMk8HPg&amp;clip=UgkxZnW-QGtWw1OJJtrnlN8JT2jTDDPGlSpP&amp;clipt=EN3wnAkYjIueCQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>nobody shuts down BLG in the 1v3.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598939/edward-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mr3/?game=245256&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Breeze</a> was the decider. BLG utterly dominated the first half, with nephh, Knight, and <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/48878/rushia">
		rushia	</a>
</span> all ending the 10-2 attack with more than 180 ADR. Despite running Jett and Yoru, EDG struggled to find information around the map, as BLG punished the enemy Duelists&#39; pushes and manipulated the rotates to ensure that they consistently hit weak sites. BLG went on to win 13-5 after a successful low buy got them up to 12. </p>

<p>The former world champions, now four consecutive wins away from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a>, will have to face a rising JDG in the lower bracket <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598947/edward-gaming-vs-jdg-esports-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr3" target="_blank">tomorrow</a>, February 5.
