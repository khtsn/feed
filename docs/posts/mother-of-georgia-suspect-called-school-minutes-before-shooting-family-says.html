The authorities responded at about 10:30 a.m., but the suspect’s mother, Marcee Gray, apparently called the school at 9:50 a.m., her sister, Annie Brown, said.</p><p>Ms. Gray told Ms. Brown in a text message after the shooting that she had notified a counselor at the school, Ms. Brown said. The phone call to the school was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/09/07/georgia-school-shooter-mother-warning/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported on Saturday by The Washington Post</a>, which cited Ms. Brown, text messages and a call log from the family’s shared phone plan that documented a 10-minute phone call from the mother’s number to the school.</p><p>Ms. Brown confirmed the details of The Post’s reporting to The New York Times on Saturday evening. And a federal law enforcement official confirmed that the mother called the school shortly before the shooting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A spokeswoman for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which has been handling the investigation, declined to comment on Saturday.
