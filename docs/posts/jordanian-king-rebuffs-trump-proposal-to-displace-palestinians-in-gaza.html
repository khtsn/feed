proposal for his country to absorb Palestinians living in Gaza, saying that he remained opposed to a plan Mr. Trump has laid out to clear the territory so the United States can seize control of it.</p><p>During a “constructive” meeting with the U.S. president at the White House, King Abdullah said, he “reiterated Jordan’s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.”</p><p>“This is the unified Arab position,” he stated in a post on social media after the meeting. “Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all.”</p><p>His statement came hours after Mr. Trump insisted the United States had the authority to “take” Gaza, part of an effort to pressure the leader of Jordan and other Arab nations to embrace a forced removal, which has drawn widespread condemnation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We will have Gaza,” said Mr. Trump, as he sat next to King Abdullah and the Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan. “It’s a war-torn area. We’re going to take it. We’re going to hold it. We’re going to cherish it.”</p><p>King Abdullah largely demurred when asked by reporters about Mr. Trump’s proposal, describing the president as a force for peace in the region and saying Jordan was prepared to assist sick Palestinian children.</p><p>But according to his statement, King Abdullah was more direct with Mr. Trump in private.</p><p>“Achieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability,” King Abdullah said in the post. “This requires US leadership.”</p><p>The meeting came a week after Mr. Trump declared that he wanted the United States to seize control of Gaza and wanted Jordan and Egypt to resettle the roughly two million Palestinians who call it home. Both Jordan and Egypt rejected the idea when Mr. Trump raised it last week at a news conference with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MfaEgypt/status/1889447692553633962" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on social media on Tuesday, a spokesperson for Egypt’s foreign ministry said that the country would work with the United States on a “just settlement of the Palestinian cause,” but reiterated that Palestinians must be allowed to remain in their homeland.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amman, the capital of Jordan, in 2022.

But now you have a U.S. president who has threatened actions that would add kerosene to an already burning fire.”</p><p>Mr. Trump in recent days has dug in on his improbable proposal to permanently resettle most Palestinians while the United States would be handed control of the territory by Israel and then redevelop it into a hub for jobs and tourism. Mr. Trump has privately been talking about the notion of the United States taking control of Gaza for several weeks, according to multiple people who have spoken with him.</p><p>Mr. Trump ramped up pressure on Egypt and Jordan on the eve of King Abdullah’s visit when he said he could cut aid to Jordan unless it took in Palestinians. Once resettled, Mr. Trump has said, those Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza. Asked how he would force Palestinians to leave Gaza, Mr. Trump shrugged off the question. “They’re going to be great,” he said. “They’re going to be very happy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of Jabaliya, in Gaza, on Monday.

Still, King Abdullah faced the difficult task of trying to protect the more than $1.5 billion in foreign aid Jordan receives from the United States while also trying to get Mr. Trump to back off his demands for the mass removal of Palestinians.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump appeared to walk back his suggestion that he would cut aid to Jordan on Tuesday, saying, “We’re above that.”</p><p>The monarchy is concerned that accepting an influx of roughly two million refugees could inflame tensions between citizens of Palestinian descent and those who are not, analysts say. More than half of King Abdullah’s 12 million subjects are of Palestinian descent. Jordan is already home to approximately 700,000 refugees, most of them Syrians who fled from that country’s civil war.</p><p>Jordan’s parliament just last week introduced a bill that would ban the resettlement of Palestinians in the country. King Abdullah could try to convince Mr. Trump that his hope to move Palestinians out of Gaza would complicate his administration’s broader efforts to get Saudi Arabia to join Mr. Trump’s 2020 Abraham Accords, which established formal ties between Israel and four Arab countries.</p><p>Rather than initially push back publicly on Mr. Trump, King Abdullah appeared to try and placate the president by saying Jordan would take in 2,000 Palestinian children suffering cancer and other illnesses. Mr. Trump responded gleefully to the statement, calling it a “beautiful gesture,” even though foreign policy analysts said Jordan had previously signaled it would take in sick children from Gaza.</p><p>Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said that King Abdullah’s offer drew from a well-established “playbook” used by Arab leaders when they deal with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Arab leaders, he said, “know how to placate Trump — and then work with the serious people on his team who have the job of making sense of his nonsense.”</p><p>Michael Crowley<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Trump and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent, reporting on the second, nonconsecutive term of Donald J.
