<p>An official press release detailed that beginning with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>, &#34;the collaboration will feature EWC in-broadcast activations at LoL Esports, VCT, and TFT global LAN events.&#34;</p>

<p>EWC&#39;s Chief Games Officer Fabian Scheuermann added: &#34;By bringing these titles to the Esports World Cup, we are not just celebrating elite gameplay - we are, together, expanding esports as a global entertainment movement, creating deeper connections with fans across gaming, music, and digital culture.&#34;</p>

<p>EWC is an annual event held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with the inaugural rendition of the games taking place last year. The competition in 2024 held 23 events in 22 esports. The addition of Valorant expands that count to 23 esports.</p>

<p>The event, set to be held in Riyadh again, is tentatively scheduled for July to August, with specific dates yet to be revealed. This may interfere with the schedule of VCT competitions, as group stage matches in Stage 2 begin July 12, with the playoffs lasting until August 29. Meanwhile, Champions 2025 is slated to start September 12, just a few weeks after Valorant&#39;s EWC tournament.</p>
