As of Friday afternoon, it was hovering about 80 miles off the coast of the city and already causing flooding with abnormally high tides.</p><p>To the south, in the neighboring state of New South Wales, local officials said about 29,000 dwellings were considered at risk of flooding as of Friday afternoon, with about 15,000 people in the state under evacuation orders. The authorities counted about 38,000 in the state without power and 46,000 in Queensland.</p><p>Officials warned that the storm’s slow churn westward, moving about 5 miles per hour on Friday, could amplify its impact on coastal communities by prolonging the rainfall and storm surges. Among the areas threatened by the storm is Lismore, a small city about eight hours north of Sydney which suffered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/world/australia/lismore-flood.html" title="">devastating floods</a> in 2022 in which 22 people died.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>On Friday, Alfred was already hitting coastal areas with damaging wind gusts up to 75 miles per hour. And, forecasters warned, there was a danger of life-threatening flash-flooding even before it made landfall. It would be the first cyclone to come ashore along the southeastern coast of the state of Queensland since 1974, according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-4"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="eighteen-map-path-embed" data-id="100000010005973" data-source-id="100000010005973"><div slug="eighteen-map-path-embed" data-sourceid="100000010005973" id="embed-id-100000010005973">
