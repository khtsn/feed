Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who is term-limited in 2026, quickly and colorfully took herself out of contention for Mr. Peters’s seat on Tuesday.</p><p>“Three letters: N.F.W.,” she said on “The View,” using an abbreviation for “no way” with an expletive in the middle.</p><p>“I’ve got a lot of things I want to get done as governor. What comes after that? I don’t know yet, I really don’t,” said Ms. Whitmer, who is also seen as a potential presidential candidate.</p><p>“I will never totally check out, but I might want to walk the earth for a little while and get reacquainted with my family and myself,” she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But her lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist II, who has been looking at a bid for governor, is now also “seriously considering” a run for the Senate, according to two people with knowledge of his thinking.</p><p>The Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/gary-peters-michigan-senate-2026.html" title="">will commit</a> to spending seven figures on Mr. Gilchrist’s behalf if he runs for Senate, Kevin Holst, the group’s executive director, said in a statement.</p><p>The state attorney general, Dana Nessel, is also subject to term limits and cannot seek re-election in 2026, and she is mentioned by some Democrats as a potential contender.</p><h2 id="link-4cebaed4">A Lineup of Democratic Lawmakers</h2><p>Plenty of other Democrats, including federal and state legislators, are mulling the race.</p><p>Mallory McMorrow, a state senator who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/us/politics/mallory-mcmorrow-michigan.html" title="">won national Democratic acclaim</a> in 2022 with a speech defending liberal values while identifying herself as a “straight, white, Christian, married suburban mom,” said she had not ruled out a run for either governor or the Senate.</p><p>“I’m taking a serious look at both the governor and Senate seats, and plan to have many conversations over the coming days to see where I might be best suited to serve Michiganders,” Ms. McMorrow, who lives in suburban Detroit, said in a text message on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>House members who have won difficult races in the past are also looking at the Senate race, including the moderate Representatives Haley Stevens, of suburban Detroit, and Hillary Scholten, from the Grand Rapids area.</p><p>Abdul El-Sayed, the progressive Wayne County health director who ran unsuccessfully against Ms. Whitmer in the 2018 primary, could also look at a bid.</p><h2 id="link-19aa7308">What About Republicans?</h2><p>Senator Tim Scott, who is the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, had been recruiting for the Michigan seat for weeks ahead of Tuesday’s announcement.</p><p>“My phone continues to ring,” he said in an interview.</p><p>Among those considering a run is Representative Bill Huizenga, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. Representative John James and former Representative Mike Rogers, who narrowly lost a Senate race last fall, are also drawing mention as possible candidates.</p><p>Tudor Dixon, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/us/politics/michigan-governor-whitmer.html" title="">ran unsuccessfully</a> against Ms. Whitmer in 2022, is also a potential candidate for Senate or the governor’s race. On Tuesday, she <a href="https://x.com/TudorDixon/status/1884321140769972649" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that she was “considering our future very seriously.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Kevin Rinke, a former auto dealership owner who lost to Ms. Dixon in the primary that year, could also jump into the race.</p><p>“One thing is for sure,” he <a href="https://x.com/KevinRinke/status/1884294929490534607" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> on Tuesday. “Michigan is open for the taking.
