</span> on Bind, only dropping one round the entire map. NRG took that as a sign to remove the map immediately and force a Corrode after ZETA took away their Abyss.</p>

<p>Both teams hit the ground running into map one, with pivotal, fast fights dictating the pace of the game early on. Every round in the first half was a back-and-forth and came down to which team emerged from the initial fights in better condition.</p>

<p>After NRG broke through with a 6-3 lead, a timeout from <span data-ref-id="3">

</span> was able to use the tactical pause to order his troops to perform a fast B hit, which ended in yet another round on the board for NRG and a comfortable 9-3 lead.</p>

<p>A successful pistol for ZETA momentarily breathed life back into the squad, a brief moment of hope that was snatched away after <span data-ref-id="5">

</span> on the same map, a feat not many could boast.</p>

<p>NRG, however, was not G2. The squad easily stole the pistol away and converted it into a 6-0 lead before ZETA could come to their senses with a round of their own. In a similar scenario to Corrode, NRG stayed in the lead 8-4 by halftime, ready to close out the series.</p>

<p>ZETA seemed all but defeated after their opponents picked up the final pistol, and went out with a whimper following a bonus win from NRG. A final timeout was called at 12-4, but the damage was done, and the round deficit was simply too much for New York&#39;s dark horse to close as they fell 13-6.</p>

<p>To the surprise of no one, mada and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11225/ethan">
		Ethan	</a>
</span> led as NRG&#39;s top performers, posting up at a 1.48 and 1.22 rating respectively. The rest of the team followed behind modestly, still performing above average and closing out rounds when needed. ZETA were unable to enter the game outside of round heroics, which were needed often to stave off the onslaught of floods and utility.</p>

<p>Now, ZETA will rematch G2 in the lower final to fight for survival, as NRG take a well-earned rest ahead of the grand finals.</p>
