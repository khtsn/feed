Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, was widely criticized as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html" title="">minimizing the measles outbreak</a> in West Texas at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. In a social media post on <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1895585297351799198" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Friday</a>, he took a new tact, saying that the outbreak was a “top priority” for his department, Health and Human Services.</p><p>He noted various ways in which the department is aiding Texas, among them by funding the state’s immunization program and updating advice that doctors give children vitamin A. But on neither occasion did Mr. Kennedy himself advise Americans to make sure their children got the shots.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, part of H.H.S., did not send its first substantive notice about the outbreak until Thursday, almost a month after the first cases in Texas were reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They’ve been shouting with a whisper,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who is an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota and a former health department official.</p><p>“I fear that their hands have been tied,” he added.</p><p>C.D.C. officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The measles outbreak in West Texas has sickened more than 140 residents and killed one child, the first such death in a decade. The lukewarm endorsement of immunization and infrequent federal updates particularly concern scientists in light of Mr. Kennedy’s long track record of sowing distrust in vaccines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert F.

I actually am quite sure that’s not the case in public health.”</p><p>In past measles outbreaks, the C.D.C. often plays a leading role in educating the public about the dangers of contracting the virus and the importance of M.M.R. vaccinations.</p><p>At the height of an outbreak in New York in 2019, during President Trump’s first term, the agency issued a <a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2019/s0424-highest-measles-cases-since-elimination.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news release</a> urging health care providers to reassure patients about the safety of the vaccine and criticizing groups that spread misleading information about it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In an accompanying statement, Alex M. Azar II, the health secretary at the time, wrote that measles was a “highly contagious, potentially life-threatening disease.”</p><p>“With a safe and effective vaccine that protects against measles, the suffering we are seeing is avoidable,” he added.</p><p>The messaging this time around has been far more muted.</p><p>By the time the C.D.C. released its first public statement about the outbreak, measles had spread to nine counties in Texas, and nine additional cases had broken out in bordering New Mexico.</p><p>The statement mentioned vaccination once, saying it “remains the best defense against measles infection.”</p><p>When asked about the cases in Texas on Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy said the outbreak was “not unusual,” and falsely claimed that many people hospitalized were there “mainly for quarantine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>He did not mention vaccines. In his post on social media, Mr. Kennedy emphasized that his department would “continue to fund Texas’ immunization program.” But he did not explicitly call for Americans to get the shots.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Instead, the vaccination campaign has largely been left to state and local officials. In Texas, there have been frequent news conferences, vigorously promoting vaccine clinics and debunking misinformation.</p><p>Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is a doctor, and who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/bill-cassidy-senator-rfk-jr.html" title="">cast a crucial vote</a> to confirm Mr. Kennedy to his post, urged residents of his state, which borders Texas, to make sure they were up-to-date on their measles vaccinations.</p><p>But a virus as contagious as measles does not respect state boundaries, and the C.D.C. should be providing greater national guidance and leadership, Dr. Osterholm said.</p><p><strong>“</strong>Any location could be the next hot spot tomorrow<em>,” </em>he said.</p><p>On Friday, the Texas capital, Austin, reported a case of measles in an unvaccinated infant who had been exposed during international travel.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
