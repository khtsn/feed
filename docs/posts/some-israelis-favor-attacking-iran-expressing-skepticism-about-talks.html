As the day went on, pundits increasingly weighed in, parsing the pros and cons of the unexpected development.</p><p>By early evening in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu had issued a video statement before his departure from Washington in which he largely strove to emphasize his close alliance and alignment with the Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We agree that Iran will not have nuclear weapons,” he said, adding that this could be achieved by diplomatic accord. But a negotiated solution, he explained, would have to result in the total destruction of Iran’s vast nuclear program, blowing up facilities and dismantling all equipment, all carried out by the United States.</p><p>But should Iran drag out the talks, Mr. Netanyahu said, the second option would be a military one. “Everyone understands that,” he said, adding, “We discussed it at length.”</p><p>With Iran’s nuclear program considered to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-military-weapons.html" title="">at its most advanced stage</a> ever, some Israeli experts have suggested that now would be the perfect time to attack Tehran’s nuclear facilities. Iran’s traditional allies on Israel’s borders are either weakened, in the case of Hezbollah in Lebanon; or fallen, in the case of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/syria-civil-war-rebels.html" title="">the Assad regime</a> in Syria. That means any attack could take advantage of Tehran’s vulnerability after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/26/world/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza" title="">Israeli strikes in the fall</a> took out air defenses around key nuclear sites.</p><p>If direct talks take place, they would be the first official face-to-face negotiations between the two countries since Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html" title="">abandoned the Obama-era nuclear accord</a> seven years ago at the urging of Mr. Netanyahu, who had denounced it as a “bad deal.”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu said in the Oval Office on Monday that if Iran could be absolutely prevented from obtaining a nuclear weapon by diplomatic means, “that would be a good thing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Many Israelis would agree.</p><p>“The ideal for Israel would be a very good agreement,” said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher and head of the Gulf program at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. He said he hoped Mr. Trump’s approach would be “more aggressive” than that of previous administrations in dealings with Iran.</p><p>“But there is nothing ideal in the world,” Mr. Guzansky added, expressing broadly held concerns that Mr. Trump “may be willing to be more flexible than Israel would be” and that a gap may open up over the issue between Israel and Washington.</p><p>The interests of the two sides already differ, Mr. Guzansky said, in that Israel sits near Iran and has to live with its proxies on its borders, while the United States is thousands of miles away and has other pressing problems. He said he hoped that Mr. Netanyahu would continue to have the ear of the Trump administration and that Israel would be kept in the picture.</p><p>Some Israeli analysts were banking on any such talks failing, noting that the Iranians were tough negotiators.</p><p>Many took consolation in Mr. Trump’s pronouncement that Tehran would be “in great danger” if it failed to reach an accord and pointed to reports of the Pentagon’s recent deployment of at least six B-2 bombers to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia as concrete evidence of a military option against Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“There is no chance the ayatollahs will agree to dictates,” Ariel Kahana, a diplomatic commentator for Israel Hayom, a right-wing daily, wrote on Tuesday, anticipating the Trump administration’s imposition of tough conditions on Iran for an agreement.</p><p>“Therefore,” Mr. Kahana continued, “a military clash with Iran is only a matter of time.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Gun Control </strong><strong>Roll Back</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-gun-control-measures.html">roll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures</a>, according to two people briefed on the move.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-Iran Talks:</strong> Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html">opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitions</a> and avoid war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drilling and Mining on Public Land:</strong> The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/climate/trump-new-mexico-nevada-mining-drilling.html">opened thousands of acres of land in Nevada and New Mexico</a> to oil and gas drilling, geothermal development and hard-rock mining, reversing protections that former President Biden enacted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Harriet Tubman:</strong> A National Park Service web page about the Underground Railroad appeared to have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/national-park-service-harriet-tubman-underground-railroad-dei.html">restored to prominently show the abolitionist leader</a>, after it had been changed to remove a large photo and quotations from her.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tech C.E.O.s and Trump: </strong>With inauguration donations and Mar-a-Lago visits, leaders of the biggest tech companies sought favor with the president in an attempt to steer regulation and tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/technology/tech-ceos-lobbying-trump.html">to little avail</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Female Military Leader Fired:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-us-military-nato-official-fired-chatfield.html">fired Vice Adm.
