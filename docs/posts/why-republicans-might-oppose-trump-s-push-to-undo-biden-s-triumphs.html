</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It could be politically difficult for Republicans to unravel Mr. Biden’s economic policies. In a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson this summer, <a href="https://garbarino.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/garbarino.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/FINAL%20Credits%20Letter%202024.08.06.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">18 House Republicans wrote</a> that prematurely peeling back the energy tax credits, which have “created good jobs in many parts of the country,” could undermine private investments. One of the Republicans who signed became Mr. Trump’s pick for the secretary of labor, Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It’s not just our belief that it’s working,” said Natalie Quillian, a White House deputy chief of staff who has taken the lead on enacting Mr. Biden’s policy agenda. “I think you see some evidence of that just in elected officials who have walked back prior statements, who have adjusted their strongly held beliefs that things should be repealed.”</p><p>“The political will is shifting as we watch it,” Ms. Quillian added. “We see the benefits throughout communities.”</p><p>The Biden administration is limited in what it can do to shield its policies from Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump will be able to reverse many of Mr. Biden’s executive actions. For legislation, federal law will restrict the new administration’s ability to block funds that have already been appropriated by Congress. But with Republicans in control of both the Senate and House, Mr. Trump could halt some of the spending by passing measures that would scale back the funding in Mr. Biden’s legislation. Republicans have generally been reluctant to break with their party on economic issues.</p><p>Ms. Quillian also acknowledged that while White House officials are emphasizing getting money out to states, they cannot significantly speed up the distribution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I don’t think there is a new option to implement differently or faster that makes these investments more enduring,” Ms. Quillian said.</p><p>Rather, the White House is focused on showing how the investments have benefited Republicans with the hope that Mr. Trump’s own party will persuade him to use restraint.</p><p>When Mr. Johnson said last month that Republicans may try to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act, which includes $39 billion in subsidies that Mr. Biden has said will revamp American semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on China, other Republicans immediately clarified that the party supported the investments. Mr. Johnson later walked back his statement.</p><p>Mr. Johnson has also said he planned to “use a scalpel” and not a “sledgehammer” on the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who runs the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, said he thought some clean energy tax credits were all but certain to be repealed, such as the $7,500 tax break that consumers can claim to offset the cost of an electric vehicle. But he said it was too simple to assume that the Inflation Reduction Act would be repealed entirely, given that much of the funding was heading to red districts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I expect this to be a pretty elaborate dance as they figure out what can go entirely, what they want to scale back and what’s going to remain untouched,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.</p><p>Michael Linden, a former economic aide to Mr. Biden who is now a senior policy fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth think tank, also said he did not think the law would go “necessarily unscathed.” He also pointed to the tax credits for electric vehicles as well as billions in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/us/politics/irs-tax-report-congress.html" title="">new funding</a> for the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on wealthy tax evaders.</p><p>But he said it would be politically and economically unwise for Republicans to repeal the law, given that it is spurring investment in communities that have been “sorely overlooked” for decades.</p><p>Kasey Carpenter, a Republican state representative in Georgia, said he was also concerned about how the loss of a major piece of Mr. Biden’s agenda would affect the local economy. Although Mr. Carpenter said he was open to some repeals, he worried that changes to the law’s tax credits could reduce demand for products like solar panels, which could negatively affect clean energy manufacturers that have recently expanded in his district.</p><p>“So much money has been spent building these facilities,” said Mr. Carpenter, who represents the Dalton area. “The last thing you want to do is get it all built, and then jobs disappear.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div><div><p>Madeleine Ngo covers U.S. economic policy and how it affects people across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/madeleine-ngo">More about Madeleine Ngo</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/mike-johnson">Mike Johnson</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/03/us/politics/biden-trump-legislation-republicans.html">217</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/03/us/politics/biden-trump-legislation-republicans.html">217</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Biden’s Unlikely Ally:</strong> President-elect Donald Trump has promised to unravel President Biden’s major legislation, but Biden is hoping to salvage his most prized policies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/us/politics/biden-trump-legislation-republicans.html">with help from an unlikely source: Republicans</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Would Higher Turnout Have Helped Harris?:</strong> Voting records suggest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/upshot/election-turnout-harris-trump.html">Democrats who stayed home were less likely to support her</a>, with no equivalent drop-off in Trump support among Republicans.</p></li><li><p><strong>Acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japanese Firm:</strong> Trump said that he would block a Japanese company’s proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel, declaring that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/trump-nippon-steel-us-merger.html">he would not allow the iconic American business to be owned by a foreign firm</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support for Patel:</strong> Several Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/trump-kash-patel-fbi-republicans.html">fell in line</a> behind Trump’s plan to choose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/kash-patel.html">Kash Patel</a> to lead the F.B.I., defending the president-elect’s right to install a loyalist who has vowed to exact revenge on Trump’s adversaries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pick for U.K. Ambassador</strong><strong>:</strong> Warren Stephens, an investment banker and billionaire who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/britain-ambassador-trump-stephens.html">donated to Trump’s rivals before eventually supporting him in the 2024 race</a>, was tapped as Trump’s ambassador to Britain.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
