Budgets being what they are, I primarily chose cities where I had friends who would happily provide me with places to stay. These were homes, almost without exception, filled with children. I have no children of my own, and this felt like a serendipitous chance to catch up with many of the kids in my life.</p><p>In America, there is a persistent, pernicious belief that the only way to be invested in a child’s life is to be a parent — and, for women, to give birth to that child. (Ella and Cole Emhoff, among others, would like a word.) In a country that offers so little support to parents, this often feels like a not-so-covert argument for taking women back to a time when they lacked control over their bodies and their finances.</p><p>Recently, the Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/07/25/the-experiences-of-u-s-adults-who-dont-have-children/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that 64 percent of women under 50 who don’t have children say they “just don’t want to.” This has contributed to another round of hand-wringing about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/opinion/birthrate-child-tax-credit.html" title="">birthrates</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/nyregion/jd-vance-kamala-harris-cat-lady.html" title="">childless cat ladies</a>. What the seemingly inexhaustible discussion around this topic leaves out is that many people who say they don’t want to birth or parent children do have children in their lives — other people’s. We rarely account for that, nor do we give full weight to the fulfillment these relationships provide.</p><p>Which is not entirely surprising. So often we hear about the annoyance of other people’s children — babies crying on planes, kids fussing at restaurants. Rarely do we talk about the pleasure of these little people, or how transformative it is to have children in your life whom you’re not raising.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I’ve been reminded of the joys of these relationships this summer. Most of the kids in my life, I have known since birth. In more than a few cases, I was present at the discovery that there was a child to be expected. Or I was the person on call to wait with a child while her sibling made an entrance. Many are children I have cared for in various stages of their life: I’ve changed countless diapers and dispensed endless bottles; I’ve given baths; I’ve been the emergency pickup contact at school. Several of these kids have vomited on me. I’m in a number of wills as the person these children will come to if, God forbid, something happens to their parents. For some, all of the above apply.</p><p>Since June, I’ve spent time variously spooning avocado into a toddler’s mouth and answering questions about what it’s like to get your period. I’ve been taught new card games. I balanced myself in the surf as a 6-year-old clung to me screaming with joy, trusting me not to let go. I attended a children’s performance of “The Little Mermaid” starring one 9-year-old who, as a 9-week-old, I held in my arms while I did an interview for my first book. Summer concluded with my driving a bunch of teens and preteens to one of their many sporting events while I cajoled them to look up from their phones once in a while and talk to me.</p><p>It has been a delight. And the experiences I’ve described are, I believe, fairly common among people who take part in the lives of children without raising their own. Yet it is simply not an experience I see reflected back to me in culture.</p><p>It’s difficult to understand why we are so parsimonious with our ideas of both a child’s capacity to love and an adult’s capacity to love children she is not parenting. Of course children benefit from being loved — the more, the better. But the reverse is also true. It is humbling to be loved by children and to be seen by them. They ground you in the day-to-day like nothing else. They don’t pull punches. They are a reminder of how quickly time passes (and, sometimes, in the case of small children, how <em>slowly</em>). They are not impressed with worldly accomplishments.</p><p>As they age, they see different parts of you, parts perhaps you are not so keen to see yourself — “Why do you have a hair on your chin?” “Instagram is for boomers.” And yet, what an astounding privilege it is to be present for the entirety of a person’s life thus far. To be a witness. To invest in children’s well-being in even the smallest ways. And through watching them grow, to have a better understanding of yourself and, by extension, of the world. Indeed, having children in your life outside of parenthood can sometimes feel like being a time traveler; I get to see the world through the eyes of children at so many different ages and experiences. It is a continual lesson in compassion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Might I suggest that is enough? To understand the extraordinary commitment it takes to parent — because you see it firsthand — and decide to direct your own time elsewhere, including to yourself and to other people’s children. Investing in these relationships is an investment in a shared future — one where I transition from caretaker, confidante and taxi driver to equal. I can see a time, in the not-too-far-off distance, when I will turn to these fully formed people as someone seeking advice and support and insight, instead of the other way around. I look forward to being present if these children have their own, just as I am happy to provide them an example of the various fulfilling forms love, and life, can take should they choose not to expand their homes. It’s hard to conceive of a more appealing or meaningful future than that.</p><p>Loving anything is an investment in the future. Loving children, however you have access to them, feels like the definition of being human.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Glynnis MacNicol is a writer, a podcast host and the author of the memoir “I’m Mostly Here to Enjoy Myself.”</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
