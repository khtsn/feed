The lobbyist never heard back about the pardon, and his client remained imprisoned for his role in an insurance bribery scandal that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/north-carolina-republicans.html" title="">shook North Carolina Republican politics</a> and left thousands of retirees <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/thousands-of-retirees-cant-withdraw-savings-invested-in-firms-controlled-by-indicted-financier-greg-lindberg-6a268369" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unable to obtain access to their annuities</a> for years.</p><p>Four years later, the lobbyist is back, pushing for a presidential pardon for the same client, the insurance mogul Greg E. Lindberg.</p><p>But this time around is different. The new administration has a team of appointees focusing on the process early in Mr. Trump’s term, with a particular focus on clemency grants that underscore the president’s own grievances about what he sees as the political weaponization of the justice system.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Lawyers and lobbyists with connections to Mr. Trump have scrambled to take advantage. They have collected large fees from clemency seekers who would not be eligible for second chances under apolitical <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-140000-pardon-attorney#9-140.112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criteria</a> that are intended to guide a Justice Department system for recommending mercy for those who have served their time or demonstrated remorse and a lower likelihood of recidivism.</p><p>Instead, clemency petitioners are mostly circumventing that system, tailoring their pitches to the president by emphasizing their loyalty to him and echoing his claims of political persecution.</p><p>Among them are a rapper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/us/pras-michel-campaign-finance-convicted.html" title="">convicted in connection with a Malaysian embezzlement scheme</a>, a reality-television-star couple found guilty of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/us/todd-julie-chrisley-sentencing.html" title="">defrauding banks and evading taxes</a>, and two Washington, D.C., police officers convicted after a chase that killed a young man.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s use of clemency in his first term “was all about cronyism and partisanship and helping out his friends and his political advisers,” said Rachel E. Barkow, a professor at New York University School of Law who has studied the use of presidential clemency. “The potential for corruption is higher” this time around, she said. “Because they’re starting early, they have figured out how they want to set it up so that people have a pipeline to get to them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Like any sequel,” she said, “it’s going to be worse.”</p><h2 id="link-207bf6c4">An Unorthodox Approach</h2><p>Both Mr. Trump and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were criticized for ignoring the screening and guidelines of the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney in their clemency grants. Clemency experts objected to Mr. Biden’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/hunter-biden-pardon-recommendation.html" title="">far-reaching pardons</a> of his son Hunter and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/biden-pardons-fauci-milley-cheney-jan-6.html" title="">other family members</a>, and to Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6.html" title="">sweeping grant of clemency</a> to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elizabeth G.

Oyer, who had been the U.S. pardon attorney since being appointed in 2022 during the Biden administration, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7303903623426560002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/trump-justice-dept-ousters.html" title="">had been fired</a> from the post by Todd Blanche, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/todd-blanche-trump-deputy-ag-senate-confirmation.html" title="">newly confirmed</a> deputy attorney general.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even before her firing, a senior White House official said in an interview that “the White House Counsel’s Office is the one handling all clemency petitions.”</p><p>Among the White House officials involved are Sean Hayes, who worked for Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, and Gary Lawkowski, who served as deputy general counsel for Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign. </p><p>In addition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/trump-pardon-czar-johnson.html" title="">Mr. Trump last month named Alice Johnson as “pardon czar,”</a> responsible for recommending clemency grants. That formalized a role she had filled as an outside adviser during Mr. Trump’s first term, when she advocated for legislation and clemency grants to reduce sentences for mostly nonviolent drug offenders. Mr. Trump in 2018 had commuted her life sentence for nonviolent drug-related offenses, then granted her a full pardon in 2020.</p><p>Clemency supporters expressed optimism that Ms. Johnson would push for pardons and commutations for people of color, as well as for those who lack wealth or political connections and whose petitions might otherwise languish in the pardon attorney’s office. Before Mr. Trump, her own application had been denied by the office, which has drawn criticism for moving too slowly and giving too much weight to prosecutors’ views.</p><h2 id="link-180e834d">Shared Grievances</h2><p>Alex Little, a former federal prosecutor, represents three people seeking clemency with appeals that mirror Mr. Trump’s grievances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“There are key players in the Trump administration who have had a front-row seat to prosecutorial misconduct,” he said in an interview. “It changes your perspective on these issues, and it’s difficult to ignore that when you’re back in government.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump has assembled a cohort of loyalists to oversee the clemency process.
