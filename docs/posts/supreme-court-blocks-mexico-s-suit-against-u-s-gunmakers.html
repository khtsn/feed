Mexico, she wrote, had not plausibly argued that American gun manufacturers had aided and abetted in unlawful gun sales to Mexican drug traffickers.</p><p>Mexico had argued that the gun industry’s production and sale of arms in the United States had helped fuel and supply drug cartels, harming the Mexican government. Mexican government lawyers also claimed the companies were aware that some of their guns were illegally trafficked, and that the country should therefore be allowed to sue.</p><p>During an oral argument in early March, a majority of the justices appeared skeptical that Mexico could prove a direct link between gunmakers and cartel violence. Several justices appeared persuaded that a 2005 law shielding gun makers and distributors from most domestic lawsuits over injuries caused by firearms could also apply to the case brought by the Mexican government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The case began in 2021, when Mexico <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/world/americas/mexico-lawsuit-gun-companies.html" title="">filed a lawsuit</a> against a number of American gun makers and one distributor, arguing that they shared blame for drug cartel violence. The country asked them for $10 billion in damages.</p><p>In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Massachusetts, the Mexican government alleged that the gun industry’s actions had burdened the nation’s police, military and judicial system. Mexico also argued that the U.S. gun industry had been negligent in marketing, distributing and selling high-capacity guns.</p><p>In response, the gun industry argued that the lawsuit should have been dismissed because such suits were prohibited by the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. That legislation was signed into law after several U.S. communities had sued firearms defendants for gun violence harms to their communities, prompting Congress to shield manufacturers and dealers from liability.</p><p>But Mexico argued its lawsuit should have been able to proceed, claiming that the legislation did not apply because the damages occurred outside of the United States. </p><p>The trial court threw out the lawsuit, but an appeals court in January 2024 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/appeals-court-mexico-lawsuit-gunmakers.html" title="">revived</a> the case, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-1st-circuit/115732544.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> it qualified for an exception to the law, which allows claims if there are “knowing violations” of firearms laws that directly cause a plaintiff’s injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In April 2024, the gun maker Smith &amp; Wesson asked the Supreme Court to weigh in.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1141/307919/20240418143513080_S_W%20Cert%20Petition.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a filing</a> to the justices, the manufacturer wrote that “Mexico’s suit has no business in an American court,” and that the country’s argument was an “eight-step Rube Goldberg, starting with the lawful production and sale of firearms in the United States and ending with the harms that drug cartels inflict on the Mexican government.”</p><p>The company was joined by another gun maker, Interstate Arms. Other gun companies in the original lawsuit had already had claims tossed out.</p><p>Smith &amp; Wesson also argued that a win for Mexico would destabilize the broader American economy by opening the door to lawsuits against all kinds of products.</p><p>When criminals improperly use a product, including guns, they are typically responsible for their own actions, the company said in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1141/332815/20241126130359423_23-1141%20ts.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a different filing</a> to the court. “If the rule were otherwise, every industry — from beer to cars to knives — would be on the hook for the predictable misuse of its product,” lawyers for the gun maker wrote.</p><p>At the March oral argument, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh had appeared receptive to those concerns. He asked about the broader implications if Mexico succeeded in arguing that manufacturers acting lawfully could be held responsible for illegal behavior by cartels, an outcome that he worried could have “destructive effects on the American economy.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abbie VanSickle covers the United States Supreme Court for The Times.
