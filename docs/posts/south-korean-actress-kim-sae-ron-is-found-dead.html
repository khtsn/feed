There were no signs of home intrusion or foul play, and the cause of death is under investigation, the police said.</p><p>One of South Korea’s most lauded young actors, Ms. Kim had not appeared in any shows since she faced public criticism after being convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in 2022.</p><p>Her death marks the latest tragedy to strike South Korea’s booming but high-pressure entertainment industry, which has faced criticism for the toll it places on the mental health of its burgeoning stars. A celebrity’s popularity is often contingent on a spotless reputation, experts say.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Over the past few years, several young stars <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/world/asia/goo-hara-kpop-suicide.html" title="">were ruled to have died by suicide</a>, one after receiving hate messages for being outspoken and opinionated, and another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/asia/k-pop-suicide-goo-hara.html" title="">after a legal battle</a> put her romantic and sex life in the public domain.</p><p>Ms. Kim started her acting career by starring in “A Brand New Life,” a film about a girl abandoned in an orphanage, in 2009. She was 9 years old when the movie premiered and was invited to the Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>She continued to appear in both big- and small-screen productions, accumulating at least two dozen credits and receiving numerous South Korean acting awards.</p><p>In May 2022, Ms. Kim’s career suffered after she was caught driving under the influence. She crashed her car into a guardrail and transformer, cutting off electricity to dozens of nearby businesses for several hours, according <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20230405002400315" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to Yonhap News Agency</a>, which reported that her alcohol levels exceeded 0.2 percent. Having an alcohol level over 0.03 percent while driving is considered a D.U.I. offense in South Korea.</p><p>Ms. Kim was fined 20 million won (around $14,000) and faced a fierce backlash on social media from the public and influencers, who criticized her behavior as reckless. The actress issued an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CdvViC8vASq/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apology on her Instagram</a> account, saying “there is no excuse for this distasteful incident.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the time of the crash, Ms. Kim was filming a Netflix series called “Bloodhounds” that was released in 2023. Several of her scenes were edited out of the final cut, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/obituaries-people-news/kim-sae-ron-dead-a-brand-new-life-the-man-from-nowhere-1236309847/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the entertainment-industry publication Variety</a>, and she did not attend promotional events with the other members of the cast. Ms. Kim also stepped down from her role in another television drama by a local broadcaster.</p><p>After that, she mostly stayed out of the public eye. Local media has reported that the actress was attempting to return to the entertainment industry in small-budget projects and a stage play. Her last acting credit remains Netflix’s “Bloodhounds,” according to the industry website IMDb.</p><p>Fans of Ms. Kim took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/thailprincess/status/1891140516038783004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">express their grief and pay tribute</a>. Her former entertainment company, Gold Medalist, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><em>If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to </em><a href="http://speakingofsuicide.com/resources" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources</em></a><em> for a list of additional resources.</em></p><p><em>In South Korea, call 109 for the Health Ministry’s suicide prevention hotline, or go to the Korean-language site </em><a href="https://www.129.go.kr/109" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>129.go.kr/109</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
