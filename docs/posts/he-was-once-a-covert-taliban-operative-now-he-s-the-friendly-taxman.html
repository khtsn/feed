He said he paid 30,000 afghanis a month, or a little over $400.</p><p>However open and efficient, it is still a tax office, though, and not every taxpayer leaves satisfied.</p><p>Shamsurahman Shams, who showed up one day late last year, had a beef with the Taxman. He said the two private schools he helped run had not turned a profit the past three years — and he carried a plastic folder stuffed with documents to prove it. Yet he had been assessed 500,000 afghanis, or about $7,350, in taxes.</p><p>He engaged in a spirited but civil discussion with a department employee, showing the man his documents. There was no resolution. He was told to return later to resume negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Although it was not the outcome he had hoped for, Mr. Shams conceded that the new process was more transparent than the previous system. “At least they listened to me,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shamsurahman Shams, who helps run private schools, visiting the tax department.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elise Blanchard for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>During the war, the Taliban ran a lucrative tax system that levied customs duties, trucking fees and local taxes in areas they controlled. They also earned millions by imposing 10 percent taxes — “ushar” in Islam — on poppy farmers, though they have since banned poppy production.</p><p>In 2023, the Taliban government collected about $3 billion in taxes, customs and fees, or 15.5 percent of gross domestic product. (The comparable rate in the United States was 25.2 percent). The biggest source for the Taliban was so-called <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/6f829bbf7186481f7eb31fbae459de5e-0310012024/original/Afghanistan-Economic-Monitor-October-2024-Final.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nontax revenue</a> — customs duties, mining revenues, telecom licenses, airport charges, and fees for national ID cards, passports and visas, the World Bank reported. That revenue, for the first half of last year, increased 27 percent compared with the same period the previous year.</p><p>Half of government revenues were spent on security and the military last year, and just 26 percent on social programs — most of that on education for boys, according to international observers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Ghorbandi said the tax system was not designed to be punitive. Generous exemptions mean that most ordinary Afghans do not pay income taxes. Shopkeepers with annual sales below two million afghanis, or about $29,500, also are exempt.</p><p>Merchants with earnings over that amount are taxed at just 0.3 percent — a rate that American conservatives would surely appreciate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Men leaving a branch of the central bank.

But scofflaws can lose their business licenses and access to the banking system.</p><p>“We are human,” Mr. Ghorbandi said. “We don’t want to put burdens on our people.”</p><p>He and Mr. Haqmal, the Finance Ministry spokesman, said the ultimate goal was to eliminate all income taxes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“It is a direct order from our supreme leader,” Mr. Haqmal said. “He said: ‘I need a tax-free Afghanistan.’” Mr. Haqmal was referring to Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban’s emir and head of state.</p><p>Another direct order from Sheikh Haibatullah has been the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/world/asia/women-taliban-prohibitions-afghanistan.html" title="">shredding of women’s rights</a> and broader restrictions on civil liberties for all Afghans.
