Now, he has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, owns a Tesla and considers himself a proud Trump supporter.</p><p>“He says what’s on his mind, and he doesn’t care about what people think,” Mr. Bahareth said on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump addressed a Saudi-U.S. business forum during a state visit to Riyadh. “Trump is about being yourself.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Bahareth, 40, is not the only Saudi enamored of the American president.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and Wednesday — the initial stop of his first major <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia.html" title="">foreign trip of his second term</a> — made a splash in the kingdom, where he heaped praise on the de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said that he had secured hundreds of billions of dollars of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-economic-forum.html" title="">investment</a> in the United States and then surprised nearly everyone by announcing he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-syria-sanctions-us.html" title="">end American sanctions on Syria.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Riyadh’s Taibah Market.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vivian Nereim/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Citizens of the conservative Islamic kingdom say that Mr. Trump feels familiar to them. His family’s fluid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html" title="">melding of business and politics</a> is the norm in Saudi Arabia — a country in which the Trump Organization has significant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/middleeast/trump-family-qatar-dubai.html" title="">business interests</a> and where government officials sit on the boards of listed companies. His reliance on relatives and friends to advise him and shape policy is unremarkable in Riyadh. And the conservative rhetoric he has adopted — in particular, his attacks on transgender people and reassertion of traditional gender norms — <a href="https://newlinesmag.com/argument/the-red-pillers-of-islam/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resonates with many</a> in the kingdom.</p><p>“From way back, I feel like he gets us,” said Fahad al-Yafei, 30, a gold salesman in Riyadh’s bustling Taibah market. “There’s affection.”</p><p>Mr. Al-Yafei said he approved of Mr. Trump’s Middle East policy, including the removal of sanctions on Syria and his rhetoric about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-middle-east-nation-building.html" title="">ending wars</a>. But he also liked his domestic policy, citing what he believed were shared values.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The best thing he did is he stopped homosexuals,” he said.</p><p>The authoritarian kingdom lacks reliable opinion polling, so it is impossible to accurately determine what proportion of Saudis has positive views of Mr. Trump. Cultural norms favor public conformity, and Prince Mohammed has intensified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-dissent-crackdown.html" title="">political repression</a> while expanding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/29/world/middleeast/halloween-saudi-arabia.html" title="">social freedoms</a>. As a result, many Saudis are reluctant to share their true views in public.</p><p>Some who did expressed a decidedly unfavorable view of the president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ali Abu-Raddad, 60, a men’s clothing salesman in Riyadh’s Souk Al Zal, said he appreciated that Mr. Trump is a “straight shooter.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vivian Nereim/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Abdullah Alaoudh, senior director for countering authoritarianism at the Washington-based Middle East Democracy Center and the son of a prominent cleric <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-salman-al-awda.html" title="">imprisoned in Saudi Arabia</a>, castigated Mr. Trump for what he described as “whitewashing” the reputation of Prince Mohammed, who he said was “an authoritarian leader who has brutally silenced all dissent.” Mr. Alaoudh lives outside the kingdom.</p><p>Still, the fondness professed by many Saudis for Mr. Trump appeared genuine.</p><p>“He’s the type of man who’s a straight shooter — he doesn’t go this way and that way,” said Ali Abu-Raddad, 60, a men’s clothing salesman in Riyadh’s Souk Al Zal.</p><p>“His visit was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia.html" title="">so good</a> that he’s ready to come to the kingdom every month or two,” Mr. Abu-Raddad joked, sipping tea in a quiet corner of the market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Muzna al-Muzaini, a women’s clothing vendor, said that she was overjoyed with Mr. Trump’s decision to lift sanctions on Syria, calling it a “brave step.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Muzna al-Muzaini among her clothing wares.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vivian Nereim/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Nearby, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/travel/saudi-arabia-tourism.html" title="">tourists</a> shopped for gold jewelry — a sign of how much Saudi Arabia has changed since Mr. Trump visited in 2017, during his first term. Men on electric scooters zoomed past a square where prisoners used to be beheaded, now a few blocks away from a gleaming new <a href="https://www.snohetta.com/projects/riyadh-metro-station" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">metro station</a>. And a specialty coffee shop served matcha and cold brew with a menu in Chinese, English and Arabic.</p><p>Inside, as a song by an acclaimed Saudi musician played — a decade ago, music was effectively forbidden in public — Nawaf al-Omar, 21, said that as much as Saudi Arabia had changed over the past eight years, so had Mr. Trump.</p><p>Before, he said, “he was really racist.” But now “I think he knows his interests,” he added, explaining that he thought the president’s Middle East policy was much better in his second term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Hussain Saleh, 23, a barista in the cafe, was less impressed.</p><p>“I mean, politically, he’s better than his competitors, maybe, but economically, in America, he’s lost,” he said, criticizing Mr. Trump’s tariff policies.</p><p>“Americans always think they’re the strongest, but in the coming period, it won’t be like this,” Mr. Saleh said, predicting that the world’s superpower was on its way out.</p><p>Half an hour’s drive north, Abdulraheem al-Buluwi, a 22-year-old college student, was hanging out beside a row of high-end cafes guarded by bouncers in black suits.</p><p>He, like Mr. Saleh, said he was not a fan of Mr. Trump’s economic policies.</p><p>“I personally feel like he’s harmed the people of America,” Mr. al-Buluwi said. Any positive steps Mr. Trump took in the Middle East, he added, were simply “acting in his interests.”</p><p>Fahad al-Sahali, 17, said he did not like Mr. Trump for a simpler reason: “He’s American. That’s it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I hate America, all of it, honestly,” Mr. al-Sahali said. “The culture and the politics. The Americans are harming Arabs, Palestine, Syria. They destroyed Iraq.”</p><p>Ms. al-Muzaini, though, insisted that Mr. Trump was a “dear guest in his second country,” echoing the warm hospitality that is central to Saudi culture.</p><p>Like many other Saudis, Ms. al-Muzaini, who covers her face with a black niqab, said she was not particularly bothered by Mr. Trump’s negative remarks about Islam and Muslims — or the fact that during his first term he had barred citizens of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.</p><p>“We only deal with what’s in front of us,” she said. “What we see is that he came and he appreciated us, and his visit is valued. If he didn’t want to, he wouldn’t visit us.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Nereim is the lead reporter for The Times covering the countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
