He will not leave WNBC entirely, and will contribute periodically to special projects, NBC 4 New York said in a statement.</p><p>Beginning with “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/nyregion/chuck-scarborough-50-years-wnbc.html" title="">Good evening, I’m Chuck Scarborough</a>,” Mr. Scarborough became an institution in New York over the decades he delivered the news about everything from storms and financial crises to protests and plane crashes. He announced the shooting of John Lennon in 1980, helmed newscasts in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and won praise with his team for its coverage of the Covid pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Scarborough anchored WNBC’s 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. weekday news shows for more than 40 years. In 2016, he stepped down from the late broadcast and continued as the co-anchor at 6 p.m. The station said his replacement will be announced later.</p><p>“Chuck Scarborough is the gold standard in American broadcast journalism,” Eric Lerner, the president and general manager of NBC 4 New York, said in a statement.</p><p>A native of Pittsburgh, Mr. Scarborough was in <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/ask-chuck-scarborough/" title="">the U.S. Air Force</a> for four years before he set off on a career in journalism. He received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Southern Mississippi, and served as an anchor at two stations in the state.</p><p>That was followed by anchoring jobs in Atlanta and Boston before Mr. Scarborough landed at WNBC in 1974.</p><p>When he marked his half-century as an anchor in New York in March, Mr. Scarborough hailed what he described as the city’s resilience.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Each time it was knocked down, people were saying, ‘That’s it, New York can’t possibly survive,’” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/nyregion/chuck-scarborough-50-years-wnbc.html" title="">he told The New York Times</a>. “And each time, we would recover.”</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
