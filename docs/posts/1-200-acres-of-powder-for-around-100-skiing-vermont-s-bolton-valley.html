It is one of the most popular ski areas on the <a href="https://www.indyskipass.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indy Pass</a>, which features <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/travel/budget-skiing-indy-pass-montana-idaho-iowa.html" title="">smaller independent mountains</a>, and among the few resorts to offer night skiing. A lift ticket at Bolton costs under $100 most days and nights, half the price of Stowe and Sugarbush.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“We are the littlest of the big ski areas,” Bolton Valley President Lindsay DesLauriers said to me when I visited the resort last month. “We have Formica in the bathrooms, not marble.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lindsay DesLauriers, president of Bolton Valley Resort</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Casey Kelbaugh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>What Bolton lacks in glam it more than makes up for with its terrain and friendly vibe. It has cultivated a niche among Eastern ski areas as a hybrid downhill and backcountry resort, leaning into demand for backcountry skiing with its fabled 1,200-acre powder preserve, known as the Bolton Backcountry.</p><p>Bolton Valley reinvented itself, because it almost didn’t survive. The one-stop shop that offered gear, guides and unique terrain — enabling snow seekers to glide seamlessly between groomed, lift-served trails and powdery backcountry glades — was brought back from the brink by devoted skiers and a new generation of a famous skiing family.</p><h2 id="link-1bf35ee0">The renaissance of Bolton</h2><p>Ralph DesLauriers, 90, and his father opened Bolton Valley in 1966, with a mission to build a “working man’s resort,” said Ms. DesLauriers, Ralph’s daughter.</p><p>“Skiing was a luxury sport for out-of-staters,” she said. “He wanted it to be accessible to Vermonters.” Night skiing was featured to enable locals to ski after work, and on most afternoons in winter, yellow buses disgorged scores of local students, who took over the mountain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When Bolton first opened, night skiing was featured to enable locals to ski after work. Night skiing remains an offering at the resort.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Casey Kelbaugh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I think we’ve taught over 50,000 local kids to ski,” Mr. DesLauriers said at his home near the Bolton base lodge. “In the end, that probably saved the ski area.”</p><p>By the 1990s, Mr. DesLauriers’s vision of a ski area for common people was a faint anachronism. Neighboring ski resorts were spending tens of millions on luxurious makeovers and marketing themselves to a more affluent clientele. The prospects of a small, independent ski area like Bolton Valley seemed bleak.</p><p>Mr. DesLauriers lost Bolton Valley to the bank in 1997, and the resort went through several owners and even closed for a season. Locals moved to save it. Backcountry skiers, who had flocked to Bolton for the beloved glades that surround it, learned in 2011 that the heart of the backcountry trail network was going to be sold. They worked with the <a href="https://vlt.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vermont Land Trust</a> to raise $1.8 million to purchase nearly 1,200 acres, which were then donated to the state and are now part of <a href="https://fpr.vermont.gov/mt-mansfield-state-forest-0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mount Mansfield State Forest</a>.</p><p>In 2017, Mr. DesLauriers surprised the ski world when <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2017/04/17/bolton-valley-resort-back-hands-original-owner/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he repurchased Bolton Valley</a> for little more than it cost him to build the resort a half-century earlier. This time, he asked his children to run it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adam DesLauriers, right, runs Bolton’s backcountry center.

She is aided by her brothers Evan; Adam, who runs Bolton’s backcountry center; and Eric, the head of mountain operations. Another brother, Rob, works as a hotel developer in Jackson, Wyo., and as a quiet adviser to Lindsay. Rob, Eric and Adam achieved renown in the 1990s as extreme skiers and were featured in more than 20 films.</p><p>Running a ski area was not in Ms. DesLauriers’s life plan. She had just received a master’s degree in literature and taken a job as an advocate in Montpelier, leading a statewide campaign for progressive workplace policies like paid sick leave.</p><p>“My brothers were the skiers. I was into literature and other things,” she said. (She is also, in fact, an expert skier, as I quickly learned when later skiing with her.)</p><p>But when her father repurchased the ski area, Ms. DesLauriers reluctantly agreed to take charge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ralph DesLauriers, 90, and his father opened Bolton Valley in 1966.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Casey Kelbaugh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The ski area “was an extension of our home,” she said. But if she was going to move back, she knew Bolton Valley needed an update. She tapped her political connections and raised $2 million in investments to fund improvements, build mountain biking trails and a wedding venue.</p><p>With Adam, she strove to make backcountry skiing a core part of Bolton Valley’s new identity. They hired guides, invested in backcountry ski and snowboard equipment to rent, and started <a href="https://www.boltonvalley.com/winter/lessons-teams-guiding/backcountry-lessons-guiding/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backcountry clinics</a>.</p><h2 id="link-478a99b9">‘If you don’t mind trees’</h2><p>Learning how to backcountry ski is what drew Steve and Ryan Rogers, a father and son from Weymouth, Mass., to Bolton Valley on a recent January morning. They had come to take an instructional backcountry tour. I tagged along.</p><p>Steve, 56, who works in the affordable housing field in Boston, researched online and determined that Bolton Valley was the only place in New England that offered backcountry ski and snowboard rental, instruction, and ski terrain all in one place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Backcountry skiing is a core part of Bolton Valley’s new identity, with the resort hiring guides, investing in backcountry ski and snowboard equipment, and starting backcountry clinics.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Casey Kelbaugh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After an hour of orientation inside a warm ski center, the pair (and I) followed the guide Scott Meyer into Bolton’s backcountry.</p><p>“If you can Alpine ski, you can probably pull this off — if you don’t mind trees,” Mr. Meyer said.</p><p>We skinned up to Bryant Camp, an old cabin built by <a href="https://boltonfriends.org/who-was-ed-bryant/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edward Bryant</a>, a conservationist and forester who bought the land around Bolton Mountain a century ago. We reached the top of a birch glade, where we removed our climbing skins.</p><p>At the sight of the beautiful low-angle glade covered in undulating powder, the Rogers duo looked equally excited and apprehensive. Mr. Meyer gently encouraged them to take their time and focus on the spaces between the trees, not the trees themselves.</p><p>They pushed off and were soon gliding through the powder. A few turns in, they were smiling. Ryan, 24, let out a delighted whoop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bolton Valley has six lifts, 71 trails, a vertical drop of 1,700 feet and a 60-room hotel.
