Landlords and several housing experts have said that rising insurance, fuel and other costs are making it difficult to maintain apartment buildings.</p><p>A final vote is expected within the next two months. Any increase would affect leases starting on or after Oct. 1.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/rent-stabilized-apartments-nyc.html" title="">rent stabilization system</a> covers roughly half of all apartments in New York City. It is an important source of affordability: The typical monthly cost of a rent-stabilized apartment is about $1,500, compared with around $2,000 for market-rate units.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The nine-person board, whose members are appointed by the mayor, seeks to balance the interests of landlords and tenants.</p><p>The board looks at factors that primarily affect renters, including employment trends and wages, and those that affect landlords, including maintenance costs. The increases <a href="https://rentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Apartment-Chart.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">often track inflation</a>, but are not directly pegged to it.</p><p>But the board’s decision also tends to reflect the priorities of the mayor.</p><p>Under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was seen as tenant-friendly, the board allowed barely any increases. During his eight-year term, the board froze rent on one-year leases three times and never raised it more than 1.5 percent.</p><p>During the tenure of the current mayor, Eric Adams, who has been more publicly supportive of landlords than Mr. de Blasio, the board has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/nyregion/new-york-board-rent-increases-vote.html" title="">backed</a> bigger increases as costs and inflation soared during the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, the board approved rent increases of 2.75 percent on one-year leases and 5.25 percent on two-year leases, similar to the prior two years.</p><p>With landlords still speaking out about rising costs, which are reflected in the board’s own research, another increase this year appears likely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Because of New York City’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/the-housing-crunch" title="">housing crisis</a>, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html" title="">few vacancies</a> and rising market-rate rents, the board’s decision has become immensely political. Left-leaning tenant groups have said they plan to protest at the meeting.</p><p>“Tenants will demand a rent freeze — or else they’ll vote out Mayor Eric Adams and elect a mayor who will freeze the rent,” the New York State Tenant Bloc, a nonprofit advocacy group, said in a statement.</p><p>Several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/21/nyregion/nyc-mayor-democratic-candidates-issues.html" title="">candidates</a> in this year’s mayor’s race have signaled that they would press the board not to increase rents. The board last approved a rent freeze on one-year leases in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.</p><p>Mr. Adams, however, characterized the push for a freeze as “idealism,” because of the growing costs of operating a building.</p><p>“Realism is protecting small working-class property owners,” he said at a news conference on Monday. “And that is what my bread and butter is. And so any plan of rent freeze should come with a plan of protecting them also.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>April 30, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article described incorrectly where the Rent Guidelines Board meeting was set to take place.
