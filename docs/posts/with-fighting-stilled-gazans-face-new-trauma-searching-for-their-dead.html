But the long-awaited cease-fire has brought only bitterness and dread.</p><p>Mr. al-Dibs is one of countless Gazans burdened with an agonizing duty: trying to recover the remains of loved ones trapped beneath the swathes of rubble left by Israel’s war against Hamas.</p><p>Some families have returned home to find corpses of loved ones so decomposed, they cannot tell them apart. Others cannot even enter the wreckage to dig, so strong is the stench of human decay. And some have searched and searched, only to find nothing at all.</p><p>As they prepared to return to their hometown, Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, Mr. al-Dibs’s two surviving children kept asking him whether their mother and little brothers might somehow have survived the blast that had trapped their bodies for three months beneath the rubble of the family home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They’d ask: What if they were still sleeping after the explosion, and climbed out later? What if, later on, the Israelis heard them screaming, and got them out?” he said in an interview. “Their questions torment me.”</p><p>Gazan health authorities have tallied nearly 48,000 among the dead, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants.</p><p>Beyond that is an untold toll: those whose bodies have yet to be found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A wide view of wreckage." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck/00gaza-rubble-02-pwck-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/3250728c-4ca3-5951-aa4b-2e6fe1b14ded" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed homes in Jabaliya earlier this month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Families have reported 9,000 people as missing. Most are bodies yet to be unearthed from Gaza’s ruins, health officials said. Several thousand of these are still not counted among the dead, as the authorities investigate the backlog of requests.</p><p>In mid-October, amid heavy clashes with Hamas, Mr. al-Dibs said Israeli forces blew up the building that housed three generations of the Dibs family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Desperate to seek medical help for family members dug out from the rubble, Mr. al-Dibs was forced into a terrible choice: He had to leave behind his wife, his two youngest children, his mother, his sisters and his nieces — 14 loved ones in all — beneath the ruins. As the Dibs family survivors fled south to safety, he vowed to return for their bodies. It was a pledge that took months to fulfill.</p><p>For weeks after he fled, Mr. al-Dibs filed repeated requests to Israel to reach the site, using a process the U.N. set up to try to coordinate with Israel to allow Gazan rescuers access to blast sites. Israel denied all of the Dibs family’s requests, the U.N. said.</p><p>COGAT, the Israeli military body that handles coordination with humanitarian organizations in Gaza, did not respond to a written request for comment.</p><p>Nearly three months later, as the cease-fire began, Mr. al-Dibs and his children finally set off home on foot, picking their way over mounds of rubble and debris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>What they found was worse than they had imagined. Bombings had leveled buildings, scattering piles of rocks on top of his family’s collapsed home.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. al-Dibs is one of countless Gazans burdened with an agonizing duty: trying to recover the remains of loved ones.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Relatives arrived, eager to help. But with Israel’s punishing siege still blocking new equipment from entering the enclave, no one had drills or other power tools to break through the rubble.</p><p>“We used what we could find: shovels, picks and our bare hands,” he said.</p><p>After hours of digging, they finally reached the flattened floor where his family had lived.</p><p>Mr. al-Dibs found parts of a skeleton that he believed belonged to his son Hasib, who was 8. But he could find nothing of his wife and 6-year-old Habib — only a few charred fragments of bone that crumbled as he tried to grasp them between his fingers.</p><p>An Al Jazeera television segment filming retrieval efforts in the neighborhood caught on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNMmAJYtwQs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">camera</a> Mr. al-Dib’s realization that he would never find their bodies. Trembling with fury, he shook out some white plastic body bags.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I brought big shrouds! And little shrouds! So I could put their bodies inside! But I found their bodies reduced to ashes!” he screamed.</p><p>Then, as his 12-year-old daughter Fatima, in a bright yellow jacket, ran up to the ruins, sobbing and calling out the names of her younger brothers, Mr. al-Dibs gently pulled her away: “Oh Habib! Oh Hasib! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!”</p><p>“They were deprived of a last goodbye,” Mr. al-Dibs said.</p><p>The family has since buried Hasib’s remains, and now his daughter has new questions.</p><p>“She keeps asking, why we can’t have graves for her mother and Habib? Where will she go sit and confide in her mother, without a grave?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. al-Dibs and his children visiting the grave of his 8-year-old son Hasib.

It says it cannot conduct major excavation efforts until heavy equipment, such as diggers, are allowed into Gaza— and which Israel <a href="https://x.com/omerdos/status/1889985581717098758" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> it will not permit.</p><p>But few Gazans, like Ramy Nasr, a trader from Jabaliya, have any intention of waiting on anyone for help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ramy Nasr and two of his daughters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Ramy Nasr</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Nasr, whose family tragedy was recounted in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/europe/northern-gaza-evacuation-risks.html" title="">report</a> by The New York Times last year, returned to the site of the explosion last October that brought down the building where his siblings and their families had been sheltering.</p><p>He paid $500 to construction workers to drill a tunnel into the building to retrieve them.
