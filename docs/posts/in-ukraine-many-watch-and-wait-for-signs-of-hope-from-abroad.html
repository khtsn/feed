He did not name those countries. </p><div><p>Mr. Starmer announced plans to allow Ukraine to use 1.6 billion pounds in British export financing, or $2 billion, to buy more than 5,000 advanced air defense missiles. And he said he had spoken to President Trump on Saturday night and believed there could be “a positive outcome” with the United States.</p><p>Other European leaders emerged from the summit, held in London, to say that the European Union would embark on a surge in military spending. </p><p>The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the European Union would present a plan to do just that on Thursday. Europe, she said, will also fortify Ukraine with economic and military aid, aiming to turn the country into “a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.”</p><p>NATO’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, said several European countries that he did not name had pledged to increase their military spending,<span>  </span>calling that a “very positive” signal. Mr. Rutte also insisted that Mr. Trump was committed to NATO, telling reporters after the meeting to “please stop gossiping” about the possibility that the United States would pull out of the alliance.</p><p>The gathering took on greater urgency after Mr. Zelensky’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">heated meeting</a> with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office on Friday raised fears that the United States would try to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">strong-arm</a> Ukraine’s president into making a peace deal.</p><p>At the summit, Mr. Starmer, with Mr. Zelensky beside him, told the assembled leaders: “We’re gathered here today because this is a once-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe, and we all need to step up. Getting a good outcome for Ukraine is not just a matter of right and wrong; it’s vital for the security of every nation here, and many others, too.”</p><p> Mr. Starmer said that the European leaders had agreed at the summit to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine and maintain economic pressure on Russia, to ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security and to forge a “coalition of the willing” to police any cease-fire. “Those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency,” he said.</p><p>The angry exchange in Washington on Friday was the latest sign that Mr. Trump was pivoting American foreign policy away from traditional U.S. allies like Ukraine and Europe. It also illustrated the seriousness of his plans to quickly end the war in Ukraine, which could result in a deal that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/world/europe/trump-zelensky-putin.html" title="">empowered Russia</a>. </p><p>European leaders have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-europe-leaders.html" title="">lined up behind Ukraine</a> and lauded its embattled president since the episode.</p><p>In contrast, Secretary of State Rubio criticized Mr. Zelensky’s demeanor at the Oval Office, accusing him on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday of having “found every opportunity to try to ‘Ukraine-splain’ on every issue.” He said that he was “puzzled” by the pushback on the Trump administration and said that the president was being unfairly criticized for trying to help Ukraine by stopping the war. “The sooner people grow up and realize that, I think the more progress we’re going to be able to make,” he said. </p><p>Here’s what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>British loan:</strong> Britain on Saturday announced a nearly $3 billion loan to Ukraine aimed at bolstering the war-torn country’s military capability. It will be paid back using profits generated on sanctioned Russian sovereign assets, and the first tranche of funding is expected to be disbursed to Ukraine next week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/01/us/trump-zelensky-news/8a330346-0259-5a3a-b3a5-05980709ac96?smid=url-share" title="">Britain’s Treasury said</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cyberoperations against Russia: </strong>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Pentagon to halt offensive cyberoperations against Russia, a move that has not been publicly explained but may be part of a broader effort to draw Russia into talks on Ukraine. The order was issued before President Trump’s blowup in the Oval Office with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/hegseth-cyber-russia-trump-putin.html" title="">Read more ›</a> </p></li><li><p><strong>Judge’s order:</strong> A federal judge in Washington on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from ousting the top official at a federal watchdog agency, saying that its efforts to do so were unlawful. The judge’s order will allow the official, Hampton Dellinger, to remain the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which protects federal whistle-blowers. <a href="#dellinger-trump-watchdog-judge-jackson" title="">Read more ›</a></p></li><li><p><strong>More troops on the border:</strong> The Pentagon is sending about 3,000 additional troops to the southwestern border, rushing to comply with Mr. Trump’s order to increase the military’s role in curtailing crossings. The reinforcements announced on Saturday would bring the total number of active-duty troops on the border to about 9,000, Defense Department officials said. <a href="#military-border-immigration"

Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday fiercely defended President Trump’s sharp turn against Ukraine’s leader, accusing President Volodymyr Zelensky of trying to derail the peace process with Russia by openly challenging Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in a heated televised exchange from the Oval Office.</p><p>“What Zelensky did, unfortunately, is that he found every opportunity to try to ‘Ukraine-splain’ on every issue,” Mr. Rubio said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Then he confronts the vice president.”</p><div><p>Mr. Rubio was in the Oval Office when Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">a public attack on Mr. Zelensky on Friday</a> after the Ukrainian president, seeking to underscore Ukraine’s need for U.S. security guarantees in any cease-fire agreement with Russia, began running through Russia’s repeated aggressions on his country since 2014.</p><p>Mr. Vance interrupted, characterizing Mr. Zelensky’s efforts to elaborate the Ukrainian perspective in front of reporters and television cameras as “disrespectful” and scolding him for not being sufficiently grateful for U.S. support. Mr. Trump, his voice raised, then accused Mr. Zelensky of “gambling with World War III.”</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Rubio leaned heavily on emotive language to push back against the critics who have since berated the Trump administration for the public display of hostility toward Mr. Zelensky, a wartime president who frames his battle against Russia’s invasion as a bulwark of Europe’s security and freedom. Mr. Rubio said he was “puzzled” by the “absurd” pushback on the administration and said Mr. Trump was being unfairly criticized when he was trying to prevent further destruction by bringing peace to the region.</p><p>Mr. Rubio sprinkled his comments with open rebukes of Mr. Zelensky. He said that the Ukrainian president “couldn’t contain himself” and had hindered Mr. Trump’s peace effort.</p><p>He said Mr. Zelensky as well as the critics of Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance — among whom are both Republican and Democratic lawmakers — needed to realize that the United States was “trying to help” Ukraine.</p><p>“The sooner people grow up and realize that, I think the more progress we’re going to be able to make,” Mr. Rubio said. He added that Mr. Trump would be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts if he were a Democrat.</p><p>Mr. Rubio has also come under sharp criticism from some of his Democratic former colleagues in the Senate.</p><p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, told “Fox News Sunday” that he regretted his support for the nomination of Mr. Rubio, who was confirmed unanimously, with all Democrats voting in favor. Mr. Van Hollen said that as a senator representing Florida, Mr. Rubio acknowledged that Russia was the aggressor in the war against Ukraine and would never have accused Mr. Zelensky of being a dictator, as Mr. Trump has.</p><p>Mr. Van Hollen said that “as a member of the Senate, Secretary Rubio was somebody who stood up for American values, American principles,” but that he was now “parroting the president’s position.”</p><p>Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and one of the most outspoken critics of the second Trump administration, told CNN that Mr. Rubio had been “a great disappointment” to many of his peers in the Senate.</p><p>Mr. Rubio expressed strong support for Ukraine when the Russian invasion started in 2022. A few days after the Russian attack, <a href="https://youtu.be/S3bcWrSZQ5o?feature=shared&amp;t=130" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said on MSNBC</a> that he could not understand why the United States “can’t begin to openly say” to Ukrainians that “we will support them as long as they are willing to fight.”</p><p>In 2023, he criticized Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida after he answered a Fox News questionnaire by saying that the war in Ukraine was a “territorial dispute” and that the United States should avoid “becoming further entangled.” Mr. Rubio said then that Russia was trying to take out the Ukrainian government and control the entire country and that its aggression could not be settled with conventional treaties and peace agreements.</p><p>Back then, Mr. Rubio also said that if Russia could expand its territory in Ukraine by outlasting the patience and support of Western nations, it would set a bad precedent for China, which could use similar military force to invade Taiwan or other territories it lays claims to.</p><p>“The message would be pretty clear,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/srkrL8EHJg0?feature=shared&amp;t=7897" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Rubio said</a>. “If you want to invade a smaller neighbor and take their land, then you can do it, and there won’t be many consequences for it.”</p><p>Maya C.

Revolution, bringing a Western-leaning leader into power. But this weekend, the streets were largely quiet, with most Ukrainians appearing to be watching and waiting after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/zelensky-showdown-trump.html" title="">disastrous meeting</a> Friday between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Would the United States abandon Ukraine? Would Europe somehow stitch together a plan at a summit on Sunday?</p><p>Iryna Movchaniuk, 37, a designer of computer games in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, said she did not expect that Europe could fill the United States’ shoes. But she did hope that the summit, between European leaders in London on Sunday, meant that the Europeans would try to work with the United States toward negotiations with Russia, and that the leaders might be able to convince Washington not to walk away from Ukraine.</p><div><p>“Europe doesn’t need to take on the role of the U.S. — it should act as a mediator instead,” she said. She added: “The U.S. is just more aggressive — they make a decision, and that’s it. Europe, on the other hand, hesitates, analyzes and overcomplicates things.”</p><p>Ukrainians know that continuing to fight Russia’s invasion will be much harder if Mr. Trump decides to cut off U.S. military supplies. But they also know that their country has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/us/politics/ukraines-war-weapons-industry-russia.html" title="">developing its own defense capabilities</a>. And some said they hoped Ukraine could rely on Europe for help with air defense and Patriot missiles.</p><p>“I would love for Europe to fully take on the role the U.S. has played,” said Yevheniia Kolomiitseva, 42, an accountant in the eastern city of Kharkiv. “I really would. But honestly, I don’t have much hope for that — at least not yet.”</p><p>Several Ukrainians also expressed confidence that their country would keep fighting for its existence, even if the United States walked away.</p><p>“I believe the war will continue,” said Ivanna Khitsinska, 36, a film producer from Kyiv. “It will be difficult, but we will keep fighting. We have no other choice.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjUxOTJiYTgtNDY3Yy01N2ZjLTk4ODctZTA1MGU3Y2FhNTY0"><div id="65192ba8-467c-57fc-9887-e050e7caa564" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/02/us/trump-news-zelensky-europe#65192ba8-467c-57fc-9887-e050e7caa564"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mark-landler"><img alt="Mark Landler" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/reader-center/author-mark-landler/author-mark-landler-thumbLarge-v7.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/reader-center/author-mark-landler/author-mark-landler-thumbStandard-v7.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/reader-center/author-mark-landler/author-mark-landler-thumbLarge-v7.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-02T17:15:39.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 2, 2025, 12:15 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>NATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, said several European countries had pledged to increase their military spending during a just-completed summit meeting in London.

They hope this effort will win the backing of a skeptical President Trump.</p><p>Gathering in London at the invitation of Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the leaders vowed to bolster support for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine after his bitter clash with Mr. Trump last week. But several also expressed hope that the two could repair their breach, underscoring Europe’s reluctance to cast off a trans-Atlantic alliance that has kept the peace for 80 years.</p><div><p>“We are at a crossroads in history,” Mr. Starmer said after the meeting. “Europe must do the heavy lifting,” he declared, but added, “To support peace, and to succeed, this effort must have strong U.S. backing.”</p><p>Mr. Starmer said he believed that despite Mr. Trump’s anger toward Mr. Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump was committed to a lasting peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. He said Britain and France, working with other <a href="#ukraine-trump" title="">European countries</a>, would develop their own plan with Mr. Zelensky.</p><p>Details of the plan were sketchy, but Mr. Starmer suggested that the Europeans could use it as a basis to persuade Mr. Trump to commit to American security guarantees. Britain and France have already pledged to contribute troops to a peacekeeping force and are trying to enlist other countries across Europe.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be taking this step down this road if I didn’t think it would yield a positive outcome in terms of ensuring that we move together,” Mr. Starmer said, referring to Mr. Trump.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Starmer said he believed that despite President Trump’s anger toward Mr. Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, he was committed to a lasting peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>His comments captured the dilemma confronting Europe two weeks after Mr. Trump’s surprise overture to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Neither Europe nor Ukraine currently has seats at the table in a potential Trump-brokered peace deal. Nor has Mr. Trump agreed to give any security assurances to prevent Russia from launching another invasion of its neighbor.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s acrimonious exchange with Mr. Zelensky deepened the divide. “Nobody wanted to see what happened last Friday,” said Mr. Starmer, who had his own, much smoother meeting with Mr. Trump a day earlier.</p><p>The prime minister has tried to mediate between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump. Speaking to both men by phone after their clash, he floated the idea of Mr. Zelensky’s returning to the White House on Friday evening to mend fences with the president, according to a senior British official.</p><p>Both leaders demurred, saying it would be better to let tempers cool and the air to clear, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. Still, Mr. Zelensky has also expressed a belief that his rift with Mr. Trump is not irreparable.</p><p>On Sunday in London, Europe wrapped Mr. Zelensky in a warm embrace. He won gestures of support from the 18 assembled leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.</p><p>Afterward, Mr. Zelensky flew to meet King Charles III at his country estate, Sandringham, northeast of London. That visit, at the request of Mr. Zelensky, had a symbolic resonance, since Mr. Starmer had hand-delivered a rare invitation to Mr. Trump from the king to make a second state visit to Britain.</p><p>Yet behind the choreographed show of solidarity, there was a recognition that keeping the United States on board remains critical.</p><p>“Starmer has two goals,” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “Build an offer with the Ukrainians and Europeans that keeps the U.S. positively engaged in Ukraine’s security, while simultaneously preparing for a worst-case scenario where that may not prove possible.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian soldier on the front line in the Dnipro region of eastern Ukraine last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>That will require European countries to shoulder a much heavier burden in the continent’s defense. Mr. Starmer pushed leaders to follow Britain in bolstering its military spending. Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, said several countries had pledged to do so, though he declined to name them.</p><p>On Saturday, after meeting Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Starmer gave Ukraine a loan of 2.26 billion pounds (about $2.8 billion) to buy military hardware. On Sunday, he announced plans to allow Ukraine to use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in British export financing to buy more than 5,000 advanced air defense missiles.</p><p>The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the European Union would fortify Ukraine with economic and military aid, aiming to turn it into “a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.”</p><p>The Ukraine war has thrust Mr. Starmer into an unaccustomed place for a British prime minister: the heart of Europe, during a crisis. More than eight years after the country voted to leave the European Union, the rapidly changing security landscape is driving Britain closer to the continent.</p><p>Catherine Ashton, a Briton who served as the bloc’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said Mr. Starmer’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/europe/trump-starmer-king-charles.html" title="">successful meeting</a> with Mr. Trump had reinforced his credentials as a leader for Europe.</p><p>“It is unsurprising that allies in Europe are gathering in London this weekend and equally unsurprising that the U.K. is being taken much more seriously in Brussels and capitals,” Ms. Ashton said.</p><p>And yet there are limits to Mr. Starmer’s diplomacy. He was unable to extract security guarantees from Mr. Trump, despite an exaggerated show of deference to the president that included the invitation from the king.</p><p>For Mr. Starmer, the crisis is an opportunity to draw closer to Europe. He has long wanted to do that on the trade front but has approached it gingerly because of the political sensitivities at home. The Labour Party does not want to lose its core working-class voters, many of whom favored Brexit, to the anti-immigration party, Reform U.K., which is led by Nigel Farage.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nigel Farage, the leader of the Reform U.K. party.

Standing behind Ukraine and against Russian aggression also puts Mr. Farage, with his history of sympathy for Mr. Putin, in a tricky position.</p><p>Whether that will allow Mr. Starmer to reintegrate Britain’s economy and trade with that of the European Union is another question. Some analysts noted that the E.U. was in no rush to overhaul its existing trade agreement with Britain, which it views as beneficial to the continent. Mr. Starmer’s political fortunes still depend on his government’s turning around Britain’s ailing economy.</p><p>“The country is in such a dire state that I don’t think Starmer will be rewarded for being an international statesman,” said Mr. Rahman, the analyst. “It’s an arguably dangerous thing for a prime minister to try to build political capital abroad when the domestic agenda isn’t moving in the direction he wants.”</p><p>Mr. Starmer’s use of the phrase “coalition of the willing” had a disquieting echo of President George W. Bush in the lead-up to the Iraq war. Britain, under a Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, joined the United States, but France and Germany did not.</p><p>The shock of Mr. Trump’s statements about Russia and Ukraine could reduce such divisions this time around, diplomats said.</p><p>“People realize they can no longer count on a nice Russia and a generous America, and that they have to get their act together on a number of issues, including defense and security,” said João Vale de Almeida, a former E.U. ambassador to the United States and Britain. The British, he said, are “more European than American in terms of what unites them to Europe and what unites them to America.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Starmer, who said he discussed his plans with Mr. Trump on Saturday night, rejected suggestions that the trans-Atlantic alliance was finished. “I do not accept that the U.S. is an unreliable ally,” he said.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
