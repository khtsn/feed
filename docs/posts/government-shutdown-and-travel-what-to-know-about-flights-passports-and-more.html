Nonessential federal operations would cease at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday.</p><p>For the busy holiday travel period, the Transportation Security Administration expects to screen <a href="https://x.com/TSA/status/1868990031240606154" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 40 million air passengers</a> between Thursday, Dec. 19, and Thursday, Jan. 2, a 6.2-percent increase over the same period last year.</p><p>The vast majority of essential T.S.A. employees would continue to work, but without pay, said R. Carter Langston, press secretary for the agency, on Thursday. But if some agents, citing financial hardship, stop showing up for work, as was the case <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/nyregion/tsa-shutdown.html" title="">during the 2018-19 shutdown</a>, travelers at airports could face longer lines.</p><p>“Triggering a damaging government shutdown would hurt families who are gathering to meet with their loved ones,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/18/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-republicans-threatening-a-government-shutdown/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement issued on Wednesday</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>According to <a href="https://www.ustravel.org/press/government-shutdown-could-cost-travel-economy-1-billion-week-disrupt-travel-during-peak" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group</a>, a shutdown could bring financial losses to domestic travel operators of as much as $1 billion per week.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/weather/christmas-travel-snow-rain.html" title="">Weather</a> could worsen any shutdown-related delays with storms in the Northeast forecast for the weekend and storms possible on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the South.</p><p>Here’s how the shutdown could affect your travel plans.</p><h2 id="link-16944ac7">I’m flying in the next few days. What could happen to air travel and why?</h2><p>More than 14,000 air traffic controllers, employed by the Federal Aviation Administration, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/politics/government-shutdown-funding.html?smid=url-share" title="">most of the 60,000 Transportation Security Administration</a> workers are among the essential workers forced to work without pay during the shutdown.</p><p>During the longest and most recent shutdown, which stretched more than 30 days from December 2018 to January 2019, T.S.A. agents at Miami International Airport called out sick at double the normal rate, forcing the airport to <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-international-airport-closes-terminal-amid-government-shutdown-11044532" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporarily close an entire terminal</a>. At one point, 10 percent of T.S.A. agents nationwide were absent, causing long security lines at major airports and even the closure of T.S.A. checkpoints. And on the last day, absences at two air-traffic control facilities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/nyregion/airports-shutdown-laguardia-faa.html" title="">led to rerouted flights and hundreds of flight delays</a> in the Northeast.</p><p>Geoff Freeman, president and chief executive of U.S. Travel, urged Congress to act on Friday.</p><p>“It’s hard to see how anyone in Congress wins if they force T.S.A. workers, air traffic controllers and other essential employees to work without pay during one of the busiest travel periods of the year,” he said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-42cb96bc">I have train tickets. Will Amtrak be disrupted?</h2><p>While <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amtrak</a> receives state and federal subsidies, the company operates as an independent entity rather than a public authority, and will ensure that normal train operations continue and workers are paid.</p><p>“Passengers planning to travel on Amtrak trains in the Northeast Corridor and across the country in the coming days and weeks can be assured that Amtrak will remain open for business,” said Jason Abrams, an Amtrak spokesman.</p><h2 id="link-4da8072f">I’m driving for the holidays. Will I be affected?</h2><p>Before the shutdown, the AAA <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2024/12/year-end-forecast/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predicted that around 119 million people</a> will travel by plane, car or another transit mode at least 50 miles between Dec. 21 and Jan. 1, an increase of 3 million travelers compared to the same period in 2023. That means already crowded highways could be even more jammed with people avoiding backups at airports.</p><p>“This year, with Christmas Day falling on a Wednesday, we’re anticipating record-breaking travel numbers the weekend before and the weekend after the holiday,” said Stacey Barber, a vice president of AAA Travel, in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-1d9e14c5">I applied for a passport. Will it be delayed?</h2><p>Visa and passport processing would not be immediately affected by the shutdown, as the federal agencies involved — the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs — are funded by fees and don’t depend on congressional appropriations for most programs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-26119f80">I planned a trip to a national park. Should I reschedule?</h2><p>During a government shutdown, most of the National Park Service sites will be “closed completely to public access,” according to the service’s <a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2024-03/doi-nps-contingency-plan-2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contingency plan</a>. “Areas that by their nature are physically accessible to the public will face significantly reduced visitor services.”</p><p>In the plan, published in March 2024, the service asks the public not to visit during these periods, and check Recreation.gov for reservations, cancellation policies and other park information.</p><p>“We remain hopeful that a lapse in government funding will not occur,” a National Park Service spokesperson said Thursday. “Should a lapse occur, routine visitor services will be available through Sunday.”</p><p>The spokesperson did not provide further additional information.</p><p>The economic and environmental impact could be serious, warned Theresa Pierno, president and chief executive of the nonprofit <a href="https://www.npca.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Parks Conservation Association</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“If Congress is unable to do its job and fund our government, the National Park Service must do what’s necessary to protect our most treasured places, which could mean closing their gates,” she said. “If that happens, parks could lose over half a million dollars every single day they are closed, thousands of park staff would be furloughed, and local economies that rely on park visitors could take a hit, only days before the holiday season.”</p><p>Faced with the loss of visitor dollars, state, local and tribal governments may choose to spend their own money <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/us/shutdown-states-national-parks.html" title="">to keep parks open</a>, subject to the approval of the National Park Service director. During the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/travel/national-parks-smithsonian-shutdown.html" title="">2018-19 shutdown</a>, states like New York, Arizona and Utah paid to operate national parks within their borders.</p><h2 id="link-3cacfa3a">OK then, how about a museum? What’s happening at the Smithsonian and the National Zoo?</h2><p>The Smithsonian system, which operates 21 museums and other sites in and around Washington and two museums in New York City, “will use prior-year funds to remain open to the public at least through Thursday, Dec. 26, except for Christmas Day, Dec. 25,” said Linda St. Thomas, chief spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Institution, in a statement.</p><p>That means attractions like the <a href="https://www.si.edu/museums/african-american-museum" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Museum of African American History and Culture</a> and the <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Zoo</a> in Washington and the <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum</a> in New York will welcome visitors during normal operating hours. All the attractions are closed on Christmas Day.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.si.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Smithsonian’s website</a> will have updates as needed, the statement continued.</p><h2 id="link-22fba0db">I’m going to Canada. What is the situation at U.S. borders?</h2><p>The country’s entry ports — sea, land and air — will remain open, and all immigration, border and custom agents will continue to work. Most staff at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, are considered essential workers. In past government shutdowns, borders and other ports of entry have operated as normal and international travelers with valid visas and passports were not affected.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 20, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article, based on information provided by National Parks Conservation Association, misstated the amount of National Park Service fee revenue estimated to be lost daily if the federal government shuts down. The association forecasts the Park Service would lose over half a million dollars, not more than $540 million.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ceylan Yeğinsu is a travel reporter for The Times who frequently writes about the cruise industry and Europe, where she is based.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ceylan-yeginsu">More about Ceylan Yeğinsu</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
