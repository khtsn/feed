Investigators have said the escapees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/new-orleans-jail-escape-worker-arrested.html" title="">likely had help on the inside</a>, and a dozen people have charged with aiding them before and after the break.</p><p>Here’s what to know:</p><h2 id="link-73b5f57f">The inmates likely had help, officials say.</h2><p>The 10 inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center at around 1 a.m. on May 16, the authorities said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After removing a toilet and sink from a cell where the water supply had been turned off, the inmates cut steel bars and got out through a rectangular hole in the wall.</p><p>They left behind a taunting misspelled message scrawled on the wall: “to easy LOL.”</p><p>After crawling through the hole, the inmates left the jail through its loading dock. They shed their uniforms, scaled a wall around the jail and then ran across Interstate 10 nearby.</p><p>The Louisiana attorney general’s office said that a maintenance worker had helped the inmates by shutting off water, which allowed them to remove the toilet and sink unit.</p><p>The worker, Sterling Williams, who was arrested on May 19, told investigators that an inmate had threatened to “shank him” if he did not shut off the water, according to an affidavit. But Mr. Williams’s lawyer, Michael Kennedy, said after speaking to his client that investigators had mischaracterized what happened.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy said that a sheriff’s deputy had told Mr. Williams that the toilet was overflowing and asked him to look at it. It appeared that the toilet had been intentionally clogged by inmates in an effort to get someone to shut off the water, Mr. Kennedy said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Williams then shut off the water. He was not acting out of fear or conspiring with the escapees, Mr. Kennedy said.</p><p>“He was merely a tool that the escapees used to further their plan — without his knowledge,” Mr. Kennedy said in an email. He said Mr. Williams planned to plead not guilty.</p><p>At the time of the escape, a civilian employee in the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office who was responsible for monitoring security systems had left his station to get food, officials said.</p><p>Officials did not notice that the inmates were missing until a routine head count at 8:30 a.m. on the day of the escape.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The Louisiana State Police have arrested and charged 11 others for helping the escapees. They include <a href="https://x.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1926022225011810802" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trevon Williams</a>, who was already incarcerated, and two women who helped transport two of the fugitives to various locations in New Orleans.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The inmates escaped out of a loading dock at around 1 a.m. on May 16.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Orleans Parish Sheriff&#39;s Office, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3bf8a1de">Two of the 10 men are still on the run.</h2><p>The escaped inmates, whose ages range from 19 to 42, had been held on charges that included murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and carrying illegal weapons.</p><p>Three of the inmates were captured on the day of the escape, and two others the following week.

One of them was arrested in Baton Rouge, La., and two in Walker County, Texas.</p><p>Two of the ten inmates who escaped — Derrick Groves, 27, and Antoine Massey, 32 — are still on the run.</p><p>Officials have cautioned residents that the escapees may be “armed and dangerous.” More than 200 law enforcement officers have been helping to track down the inmates, the state police said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Agencies, including the F.B.I. and CrimeStoppers, have <a href="https://x.com/LAStatePolice/status/1924513938043019384" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered</a> reward money totaling $20,000 for information leading to the capture of each fugitive.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A law enforcement helicopter searching for the escaped inmates on Tuesday in New Orleans. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gerald Herbert/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-63fa6990">Overcrowding, understaffing and security concerns at the jail.</h2><p>Officials have said that they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/new-orleans-louisiana-jail-escape.html" title="">investigating</a> multiple security failures at the jail. At least three employees of the Sheriff’s Office have been suspended without pay while an internal investigation is underway.</p><p>Before the escape, there were already concerns about poor conditions, overcrowding and understaffing at the jail, which is run by the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office.</p><p>It has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 — an agreement under which officials must work to meet federal standards. A federal monitor had also complained that the supervision at the jail was inadequate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>About a third of the cameras in the jail do not work, the Sheriff’s Office has said, and the jail had “defective locks and doors.” The inmates had broken open a locked cell door as part of their escape.</p><p>Sheriff Susan Hutson said that the jail had been holding about 1,400 inmates — far more than the guards could handle — and that it had requested $13 million from city officials for security and other needs.</p><p>The jail, she said, had been struggling with “outdated surveillance, aging infrastructure, blind spots in supervision and critical staffing shortages.”</p><p>Michael Levenson<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hank Sanders<!-- -->, <!-- -->Yan Zhuang<!-- --> and <!-- -->Qasim Nauman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabella Kwai is a Times reporter based in London, covering breaking news and other trends.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
