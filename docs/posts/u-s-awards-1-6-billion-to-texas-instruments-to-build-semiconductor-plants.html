The grant is meant to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors, the tiny chips that are key components of electronic devices.</p><p>The investment will “advance U.S. economic security and mitigate those same supply chain vulnerabilities that were brought to light during the pandemic,” said Laurie E. Locascio, the under secretary of commerce for standards and technology, during a call with reporters on Thursday night.</p><p>In addition to the grant, the department will award up to $3 billion in loans to Texas Instruments, officials said. The company is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment. The funds will support the company’s investment of more than $18 billion to construct the new facilities, officials said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The funding comes from the CHIPS Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support in 2022. The legislation was intended to bolster the domestic production of semiconductors and reduce the nation’s dependence on Asian countries for them. Only about 10 percent of the world’s semiconductors are manufactured in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990.</p><p>Ramping up domestic chip manufacturing has been a major goal for President Biden, whose economic policy agenda focuses in part on boosting American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have moved overseas in recent decades.</p><p>The legislation also came in response to the expensive and economically damaging <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/technology/computer-chip-shortage.html" title="">chip shortages</a> that occurred during the pandemic. Officials said the Texas Instruments award would support the company’s production of current-generation and mature, or less advanced, semiconductors that were in short supply during the pandemic.</p><p>The law gave the Commerce Department $39 billion to dole out as grants to encourage chipmakers to build and expand new facilities in the United States. So far, the Biden administration has announced more than $30 billion in grants through the program. Several companies that manufacture more advanced semiconductors have received multibillion dollar awards in recent months, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/us/politics/chips-act-grant-intel.html" title="">Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/us/politics/tsmc-taiwan-chips-grants.html" title="">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/us/politics/samsung-biden-administration-award-taylor-texas.html" title="">Samsung</a>.</p><p>Texas Instruments <a href="https://investor.ti.com/news-releases/news-release-details/texas-instruments-breaks-ground-new-300-mm-semiconductor-wafer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke ground</a> on its new plants in Sherman in May 2022, and <a href="https://news.ti.com/2023-11-02-Texas-Instruments-breaks-ground-on-new-300-mm-semiconductor-wafer-fabrication-plant-in-Utah" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on its Lehi plant</a> in November 2023.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Together, the new plants are expected to create more than 2,000 manufacturing jobs, federal officials said. The <a href="https://www.ti.com/about-ti/company/ti-at-a-glance/manufacturing/sherman.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first facility in Sherman</a> is expected to begin production as early as 2025, and the <a href="https://www.ti.com/about-ti/company/ti-at-a-glance/manufacturing/lehi.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plant in Lehi</a> is expected to start production as early as 2026.</p><p>The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/politics/chips-grants-fuel-industry-growth.html" title="">has estimated</a> that the new investments will help the United States triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, increasing the nation’s share of global chip manufacturing to 14 percent.</p><p>The federal effort has helped catalyze nearly $400 billion in private investments from semiconductor and electronics companies, administration officials said.</p><p>Still, longer-term questions about the viability of some companies remain. Intel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/technology/intel-layoffs-quarterly-report.html" title="">said</a> this month that it would cut more than 15,000 jobs, or about 15 percent of its work force. Company officials have said they remained committed to expanding its semiconductor facilities in America.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Madeleine Ngo covers U.S. economic policy and how it affects people across the country.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
