India announced the resumption of civilian flights at over 30 airports in the north of the country. The authorities in Pakistan said that all airports in the country were open.</p><p>The situation along the two countries’ extensive boundary remained tenuous, with tens of thousands of people still displaced from their homes. But there were no reports of a major breach on Sunday night, the second evening of the cease-fire, the result of a diplomatic push from the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For most of last week, the two countries were engaged in intense fighting that brought cross-border shelling and claims from both sides that they had inflicted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-drones.html" title="">damage on the other’s military bases</a>. Both sides said that their military leaders would speak again on Monday and assess the agreement’s future. But as of Monday afternoon, there was no update from either nation.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Still, there was optimism in financial markets. Pakistani stocks soared, with the Karachi 100 index gaining almost 9 percent, a record. But trading was halted because the market <a href="https://www.psx.com.pk/psx/files/?file=253689-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rose by so much and so fast</a>. India’s markets, which are about 12 times the size of Pakistan’s, also jumped and more than erased last week’s losses.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A market in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Monday.

New Delhi blamed the carnage on groups that it said were receiving support from Pakistan — an accusation Islamabad has denied — and vowed retaliation.</p><p>Two weeks after the massacre, near the town of Pahalgam, India bombed what it described as terror facilities in Pakistan. The two countries have fought several wars against each other and have engaged in periodic clashes closer to the line that divides Kashmir between them. But last week’s airstrikes hit the deepest targets that India had struck in mainland Pakistan in at least half a century.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Pakistan retaliated soon after.
