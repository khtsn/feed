That was up from 2.6 percent previously, and in line with economists’ expectations.</p><p>Looking at a “core” measure that strips out volatile food and fuel prices to give a sense of the underlying trend in inflation, price increases climbed at the same pace as in October.</p><p>The report was a reminder that the central bank has yet to achieve a full victory.</p><p>Fed policymakers will decide whether or not to cut interest rates for a third and final time this year at their Dec. 17-18 gathering, and they will also release a fresh set of economic projections for 2025. The recent stalling in progress on inflation — which has proved stubborn in recent months — could inform both this month’s decision and what comes next.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s what else to know about the numbers:</p><ul><li><p>Economists watch how much the price index climbed compared with the previous month for a sense of how trends are shaping up. In November, overall monthly inflation picked up to 0.3 percent, up from 0.2 percent previously, while the core number held steady at 0.3 percent.</p></li><li><p>The Fed aims for 2 percent yearly inflation. They define that goal using a separate but related index, the Personal Consumption Expenditures measure. That <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will come out on Dec. 20</a>, so this is the last big inflation report officials will have in hand before their meeting.</p></li><li><p>Investors <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mostly expected</a> the Fed to cut interest rates this month in the days leading up to Wednesday’s report, and several economists reaffirmed their projections for a rate cut next week after the release.</p></li><li><p>But the even bigger question is how much Fed officials will cut interest rates next year. Interest rates are now set to <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 4.6 percent</a>, which is well above the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20240918.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roughly 2.9 percent</a> rate that officials think would be enough to keep the economy growing steadily and sustainably over time (often referred to as a “neutral” rate setting).</p></li><li><p>Fed policymakers <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20240918.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last released economic projections</a> in September, but they are expected to release fresh ones after their meeting next week. If they are worried about slow inflation progress and comforted by recent economic strength, they could project fewer rate cuts in 2025.</p></li><li><p>Officials are likely to look at the report’s details as they are making their calculus. Encouragingly, measures that track cost increases for both owned and rental housing are finally cooling. Both climbed at the slowest monthly pace since 2021. Because rent makes up such a big chunk of overall inflation, that could help to pave the way for cooler readings going forward. </p></li></ul></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
