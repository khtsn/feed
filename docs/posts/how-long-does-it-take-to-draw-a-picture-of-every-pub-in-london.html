    <h1>How Long Does It Take to Draw a Picture of Every Pub in London?</h1>

Then, for an hour, she drew flat out, her eyes flicking between the tall, tiled boozer and her page.</p><p>“Oh wow, that’s so good!” said Emily Finch, 33, a passer-by on an early lunch break.</p><p>“Thank you,” Ms. Wood replied. “I’ve got a long way to go.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>That was true in more ways than one. Ms. Wood, 31, is on a mission to draw every pub in London. She has completed about 300, and has about 2,500 left, according to data on the city’s pubs from CGA by NIQ, a research consultancy.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-10/00int-uk-pub-artist-10-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-10/00int-uk-pub-artist-10-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-10/00int-uk-pub-artist-10-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A young woman in a white sleeveless cotton top, standing in front of the windows and green tiled exterior of a pub." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-10/00int-uk-pub-artist-10-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-10/00int-uk-pub-artist-10-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-10/00int-uk-pub-artist-10-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-10/00int-uk-pub-artist-10-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/1068692e-e03c-5f58-9128-ccb67e2c6881" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The artist Lydia Wood is on a mission to draw every pub in London.

Ms. Finch, the passer-by, said that the Clyde had become one of her go-to’s, because “a lot of my locals have closed down.”</p><p>That has led some to wonder whether Ms. Wood’s project is an ode, an archive, or, for the unluckier pubs, a requiem.</p><p>“What will be painful is seeing, by the time she starts and the time she finishes, how many have closed,” said Alistair von Lion, a pub historian and tour guide who runs a website called the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/londonpubexplorer/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London Pub Explorer</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Britain’s public houses are thought to have <a href="https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/The-Great-British-Pub/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evolved</a> from the wine bars — or <a href="https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/9qVj08mAiJ/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tabernae</a> — introduced by the Romans after they invaded some 2,000 years ago. These roadside inns became known as taverns, and tended to serve more British-made ale than wine.</p><p>Over the centuries, the neighborhood pub took on a vital community role in many towns and villages. Today, it watches over first dates and post-work vents and breakups. It is a living room for friends whose apartments are too small to host a birthday party, a micro-stadium for a sports fan who can’t afford a season ticket and a kitchen table for the lonely and the too-tired-to-cook.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-8"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Blackfriar pub in London...</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>... which Ms. Wood drew for her project.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Wood, a self-described “pub person,” picks her subjects at random, zigzagging across the city on instinct and whim. Even the unattractive ones have value, she notes. “To someone,” she said, musing in her studio, “the flat-roof, fringes-of-London kind of pub might be the most important place in the world.”</p><p>Ms. Wood, who drew through her childhood in London and then studied art at Goldsmiths, sees her project as a decades-long documentation — a life’s work, not a series of isolated sketches. She tries to draw two to three a week, depending on the weather.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“I’m at the beginning of essentially a 30-year project,” she said, shading in a portion of brick and fixing a line with an eraser.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Harp pub in Covent Garden, is also part of Ms. Wood’s project...</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>... which has earned her tens of thousands of social media followers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Wood taught art until the coronavirus pandemic. When her classes dried up, she began sketching pubs to make extra money, and offered drawings for sale on social media in 2020 for £40 each (about $55). The orders started flooding in, and friends started begging her to draw their local.</p><p>It was such a success that it became her full-time job. She now charges about £380 for originals on A4 size paper, about the size of a standard Letter sheet in the United States, although prints are less than £50. She also sells pub calendars, which she pitches as a yearlong pub crawl.</p><p>Sometimes, she takes commissions, but not often: Every pub has its regulars, so her originals tend to sell quickly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>She spends at least a full day on each drawing, no matter how popular and beautiful — or how dingy and forgotten — that pub may be.</p><p>“I felt like kind of bringing them all on an even playing field,” she said. While she knows that many London pubs are facing trying times, she is most worried about “the really, really unspoken ones, or the ones that people forget about — or certain people didn’t step foot in.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-16"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-covers-02/00int-uk-pub-artist-covers-02-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/world/00int-uk-pub-artist-covers-02/00int-uk-pub-artist-covers-02-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/06/08/141612_1_00int-uk-pub-artist-video2_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Video by Ayesha Kazim</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Before the pandemic, there were more than 3,000 pubs in London, according to CGA by NIQ. Now, there are about 2,800. Coronavirus hurt the entire nighttime industry, as people got used to staying at home, ordering in and spending time on their phones instead of with other people. And <a href="https://www.beerguild.co.uk/news/save-our-pubs-londons-independent-pubs-join-forces-in-discount-scheme-amidst-budget-bill-hike-fears/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">independent pubs</a> were already facing extra pressures from rising rent and price competition from large pub chains.</p><p>“The economics are the primary issue,” said Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, a trade body. As the price of a pint keeps rising, he said, people either have fewer drinks or drink cheaper supermarket beer at home, even if it is lonelier. “People have only got so much money in their pocket,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Outside the Clyde, a group of people had stopped to watch Ms. Wood as she completed her outline. Adam Colebrooke-Taylor, 60, a former firefighter turned fire instructor, struck up a conversation as he finished his early evening drink.</p><p>He said that the pub had been loved by generations of London firefighters, who would come for a pint after learning at a nearby fire training center, adding that the pub was part of “London Fire Brigade folklore.”</p><p>“Every firefighter went through here,” agreed his colleague, Naomi Simington, 47.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A passerby stopping to admire Ms. Wood’s drawing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Wood’s custom made tape, with her drawings.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“I never thought I’d see her drawing one in real life,” said Iona Davidson, 22, who had recognized the artist by her signature red stool, a fixture of her videos.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Ms. Wood’s profile has risen in recent months.

She flicked through the window boxes with deft, practiced squiggles.
