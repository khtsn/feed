    <h1>The World Mourned Pope Francis</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Tributes poured in from around the world today after the Vatican announced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/21/world/pope-francis-updates-vatican" title="">Pope Francis had died at 88</a>. Tearful mourners gathered in St. Peter’s Square and Buenos Aires, his birthplace. Candles were lit in New York, New Delhi, Jerusalem and Nairobi. Catholics offered prayers from churches in London, Seoul and Kyiv.</p><p>Francis, according to the Vatican, died in his home after a cerebral stroke. His health had been declining, but he kept busy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-easter-last-day.html" title="">against his doctors’ orders</a>, until his final day: Just hours before his death, Francis appeared in his wheelchair to bless the faithful on Easter Sunday. The Vatican said he had asked to be buried <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-will-released.html" title="">in a simple tomb</a>, “without particular decoration” and with only the inscription: “Franciscus.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-dead.html" title="">Our obituary traces Francis’ extraordinary life</a>: Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, he rose from modest means in Argentina to become the first Jesuit and Latin American pope. He clashed bitterly with traditionalists, and he used his 12-year pontificate to make the Catholic Church <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-catholic-church-legacy.html" title="">more inclusive</a>. He also opened space for debate, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/pope-francis-catholic-conservatives.html" title="">catalyzed the Catholic right in the U.S</a>. </p><p>“Pope Francis was a pope of surprises,” Jason Horowitz, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/for-a-times-reporter-who-covered-him-pope-francis-was-always-a-surprise.html" title="">our Rome bureau chief</a>, said. “He defied expectations for the church he led, and the world he cared so much about, but he was also deeply consistent on the issues he cared most about: migrants, the environment and inequality. He made important changes within the church, but on the global stage, I think his voice on those priorities may be most missed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis presiding over the funeral of Pope Benedict in St. Peter’s Square in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Hill for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump has so far been unwilling to fire any of his top officials, a marked change from his first administration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-68bff9c3">Trump said concerns about Hegseth were a ‘waste of time’</h2><p>President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-hegseth-signal-chat-leak.html" title="">threw his support behind</a> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth today after The Times reported over the weekend that Hegseth had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html" title="">shared sensitive military information in a second Signal group chat</a> that included his wife and brother. The president characterized concerns about the texts as a “waste of time.”</p><p>Hegseth’s office has also been shaken by the sudden firings of three of his top advisers. They were escorted from the Pentagon last week<strong> </strong>after being accused of leaking sensitive information. Another former official, who left last week, wrote in Politico that the Pentagon is “in disarray” and that Trump should remove Hegseth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuri Gripas/Sputnik, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-7bf0235b">The U.S. asked a judge to break up Google</h2><p>Lawyers for the Justice Department told a judge in a Washington, D.C., courthouse today that the best way to address Google’s monopoly in internet search was to break up the $1.81 trillion company.
