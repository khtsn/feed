Trump and his allies related to interference in the 2020 election.</p><p>In Wisconsin, three of President-elect Donald J. Trump’s former advisers, who are facing numerous felony charges, appeared before a judge for the first time. In Nevada, the state attorney general, Aaron D. Ford, filed new charges in an effort to revive a case against six Republicans who acted as fake electors for Mr. Trump in 2020, in spite of his loss at the polls there.</p><p>And in Georgia, Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, pushed back against an attempt by Republicans in Congress to subpoena documents related to her prosecution of Mr. Trump and his allies. In a letter to Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Ms. Willis wrote that the committee’s “dogged attempt to disrupt an independent state prosecution is an unconstitutional perversion of congressional oversight authority.”</p><p>The defendants in Wisconsin, two of whom appeared via telephone before a state judge in Madison, are all expected to plead not guilty to 11 felony charges. They include Kenneth Chesebro, a Wisconsin native who devised a plan to deploy fake electors for Mr. Trump in swing states that he lost in 2020, and Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign adviser who played a major role in carrying out the plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The third defendant, James R. Troupis, is a Wisconsin lawyer who circulated the fake elector plan within the Trump campaign. The Trump team’s strategy ultimately involved submitting paperwork to federal officials falsely claiming that Mr. Trump had won several battleground states; it led to criminal prosecutions in Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada.</p><p>The Thursday hearing took place in a Wisconsin courtroom with about 30 onlookers, many of whom appeared to be supporters of the defendants. Mark R. Fremgen, the circuit court commissioner, set bond terms for the men, including that they refrain from contact with any of the 10 people who acted as fake electors in Wisconsin. All three, through their lawyers, agreed to the terms.</p><p>Georgia is the only state that has charged Mr. Trump himself, but legal experts do not expect him to stand trial while he is a sitting president. Several of his current and former advisers are far more likely to face trial, including the three Wisconsin defendants. Michigan and Arizona have also brought charges.</p><p>Mr. Trump continues to falsely claim he won the 2020 election, and his incoming administration is even asking prospective jobholders their opinion about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/us/politics/trump-administration-loyalty-test.html" title="">who won the 2020 election</a>. But false claims about what happened in 2020 continue to crumble. Last week, Dinesh D’Souza, a Trump ally who wrote and directed “2000 Mules,” a movie that spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/dinesh-dsouza-2000-mules-apology-trump.html" title="">acknowledged</a> that the findings it presented were based on a faulty analysis; Mr. D’Souza is facing a lawsuit over the film.</p><p>The prosecutors leading the state criminal cases are all Democrats and remain determined to see them through, given the substantial body of public evidence. Nevada brought charges earlier this year, but they were dismissed by a Clark County judge, who ruled that prosecutors had brought the case in the wrong jurisdiction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Ford’s office has appealed that decision, but it filed new charges in Carson City, the state capital, to keep the case going should it lose in Clark County.</p><p><strong>“</strong>For every one person I hear say that this is a witch hunt, frankly, there are two or three others who are saying just the opposite,” Mr. Ford said in a recent interview.</p><p><em>“</em>I<em> </em>don’t make prosecutorial decisions based on political opinions, nor through public perception,” he added. “I base it on one point, and that point is justice. And justice requires that this prosecution and these prosecutions continue.”</p><p>In Wisconsin, the three defendants were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/us/politics/wisconsin-charges-3-trump-allies-in-fake-electors-scheme.html" title="">charged in June</a> with a single count of forgery-uttering, a felony that carries a penalty of up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. On Tuesday, the office of Josh Kaul, Wisconsin’s attorney general, brought 10 new forgery-related charges in an amended complaint, claiming that the 10 Wisconsin residents who were recruited to be fake Trump electors in 2020 were deceived into signing an election certificate that was sent to Congress.</p><p>Mr. Chesebro pleaded guilty last year to a single felony conspiracy charge in Georgia’s parallel case. He was sentenced to five years’ probation and agreed to cooperate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Manny Arora, a lawyer for Mr. Chesebro, said he expected “a favorable result” in Wisconsin. He noted that he had recently filed to have Mr. Chesebro’s plea vacated in Georgia, since the presiding judge there has dismissed the conspiracy charge for some of the remaining defendants.</p><p>Other criminal cases involving Mr. Trump have fizzled. The Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/us/politics/jack-smith-trump-election-documents-charges.html" title="">dropped</a> its two cases against him after he won the election last month; it has a policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. And while Mr. Trump was convicted earlier this year of 34 felonies in a Manhattan case related to falsifying business records, the judge recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/nyregion/trump-sentencing-postponed.html" title="">put off the sentencing</a>, and prosecutors have signaled a willingness to freeze the case for the duration of Mr. Trump’s new presidential term.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Trump and other defendants are pursuing a number of strategies to get the state elections cases dismissed. A central strategy invokes the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which establishes that federal law takes precedence over state law. In a recent motion seeking to have the case in Georgia dismissed, Mr. Trump’s lawyer there, Steve Sadow, said the Supremacy Clause was among the legal impediments that “prevent state prosecutors from proceeding against the sitting president in any way.”</p><p>Likewise, in a recent filing in Wisconsin, Joseph A. Bugni, a lawyer for Mr. Troupis, called the case against his client to be “the most glaring violation of the Supremacy Clause one could imagine.”</p><p>After Thursday’s hearing, Mr. Troupis spoke briefly to reporters, calling the charges “lawfare” inspired by politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Prosecutors have generally argued that the plan to use fake electors to keep Mr. Trump in office after 2020 was part of a broader plot to knowingly thwart the outcome of the vote once election results had been certified by local officials, recounts had concluded and legal challenges had failed.</p><p>A number of the 2020 fake electors were tapped to act as electors again for Mr. Trump in 2024, including six from Michigan alone. The cases against them and other defendants are likely to take years to play out. A trial has been scheduled for January 2026 in Arizona, and other state trials could come even later.</p><p>Defendants in the various cases include some of the most high-profile former aides to Mr. Trump, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was once his personal lawyer, and Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danny Hakim is a reporter on the Investigations team at The Times, focused primarily on politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danny-hakim">More about Danny Hakim</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>20</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Election Interference Cases Inch Ahead as Trump Allies Appear in a Wisconsin Court<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
