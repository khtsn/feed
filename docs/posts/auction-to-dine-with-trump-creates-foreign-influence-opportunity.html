And in a matter of weeks, the Trumps and their partners have reeled in more than $1.3 million in fees, taking a cut every time the coins changed hands, according to Chainalysis, a crypto data firm.</p><p>Certain other large traders, sensing an opportunity to cash in, have moved quickly to sell their $TRUMP holdings, exploiting the run up in price caused by Mr. Trump’s promotional push as new money poured in from people enticed by <a href="https://gettrumpmemes.com/dinner" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his offer</a> of “the most exclusive invitation in the world.”</p><p>But the blitz of profit-seeking by Mr. Trump and his family is also provoking a backlash.</p><p>Last week, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-crypto-senate-investigation.html" title="">helped derail</a> a major piece of crypto legislation pending in Congress, as the sale prompted objections from crypto <a href="https://x.com/mikewchan/status/1920177337888354687" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">industry executives</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-to-take-key-vote-on-crypto-bill-as-democratic-opposition-threatens-path-forward/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawmakers</a>, including some Republicans.</p><p>“It does give me pause because it complicates our work here,” Senator Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, said in an interview last week after some Democrats began to balk on the crypto bill over Mr. Trump’s involvement in the industry. “The optics are challenging.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Trading records examined by The New York Times show that a <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/34KjpRFok5aGstxMty3mg5VBGK7xDACg6QRCtKuuW6rCVR6EPFTs618dJkKdMtxdxhef2Viz5yUPMS2kz1zHUUXR" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flurry</a> of purchases of the $TRUMP token started the day before the coin’s backers disclosed the contest. Information <a href="https://x.com/trenchdiver101/status/1913492038151987682" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had leaked</a> about the upcoming promotion, allowing certain parties to make early bets that the market price was about to jump, the records suggest.</p><p>The aggressive effort by Mr. Trump and his partners to promote the dinner has also drawn scrutiny from former securities regulators, who assert that Mr. Trump may be violating federal securities laws. However, he would almost certainly not be targeted for investigation, now that his administration has curtailed crypto enforcement efforts at both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.</p><p>“This absolutely would have triggered an initial investigation,” said John Reed Stark, an enforcement attorney who spent 18 years at the S.E.C., including as chief of its unit that examined cybercrimes. “Or at least it certainly would have under norms from prior Republican and Democratic eras.”</p><p>White House officials have rejected the criticism. One senior official called the dinner “a private event” that would take place during the president’s personal time. At a news conference on Friday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Mr. Trump is “abiding by all conflict-of-interest laws.”</p><p>“I can assure you the president acts with only the interests of the American public in mind, putting our country first and doing what’s best for our country. Full stop,” Ms. Leavitt <a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-may-9-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A spokesman for the Trump Organization declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump started selling $TRUMP on Jan. 17, three days before Inauguration Day, prompting the coin’s price to soar briefly, before it crashed. The memecoins were one facet of a wide array of crypto ventures that he has pursued since he embraced the industry on the campaign trail last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-05-09-trump-memecoin-trump-memecoin" data-id="100000010159044" data-source-id="100000010159044"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Trump’s Influence on $TRUMP</h2><p data-testid="leadin" id="interactive-leadin">President Trump’s memecoin has lost value since it began trading, but it has benefited from his social media posts along the way.</p></header><div slug="2025-05-09-trump-memecoin-trump-memecoin" data-sourceid="100000010159044" id="embed-id-100000010159044">

One trader who goes by the nickname “ABC” <a href="https://app.nansen.ai/profiler?address=72C98wU5aPwdmTvuX9oRmp2ZbjXdt3V7Jp9Q17dPDrX9&amp;chain=solana&amp;tab=transactions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">purchased 126,000 $TRUMP</a> coins as soon as the dinner was announced and then <a href="https://app.nansen.ai/profiler?address=72C98wU5aPwdmTvuX9oRmp2ZbjXdt3V7Jp9Q17dPDrX9&amp;chain=solana&amp;tab=transactions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold them</a> all just eight days later, pocketing $407,000 in profits.</p><p>Even though the ABC wallet now contains zero $TRUMP coins, the trader might still receive an invitation to the dinner because the winners are picked based on their average holdings over the course of the contest.</p><p>All the frantic trading has enriched Mr. Trump and his family.</p><p>Each time someone sells a $TRUMP coin, the family and its partners receive a cut. Since January, the memecoin has generated $320 million in fees for them, according to Chainalysis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eric Trump at a crypto conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, this month.
