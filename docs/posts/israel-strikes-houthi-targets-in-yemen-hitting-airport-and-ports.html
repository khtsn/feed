And even if it takes time, this lesson will be understood across the Middle East.”</p><p>On Thursday after the Israeli strikes, Mr. Netanyahu said in <a href="https://x.com/Now14Israel/status/1872351668659995136" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview</a> with an Israeli TV station of the Houthis: “We are just getting started with them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At least four people were killed and 21 others injured in the attack on Thursday after Israel struck the international airport in Sana and the city of Al Hodeidah, the Saba state news agency said, citing Yemen’s Health Ministry. The report could not be independently verified.</p><p>Since Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the Israeli military has not only decimated the Palestinian group in Gaza, but it has also bombed other Iran-backed proxies in the region, wiping out most of the leadership of the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon after the group began rocket launches into Israel in solidarity with Hamas. Israel has also hit sites in Syria that it said hosted Hezbollah infrastructure. And Israel has struck Iran itself in retaliation for the huge barrages of missiles and drones that Iran launched against Israel.</p><p>Military analysts have widely deemed the Houthis less of a threat than other Iran-backed militias like Hezbollah or Hamas. But Israel is apparently turning more attention to the Houthis now as the last major Iranian proxy threatening its national security, after reaching a cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah last month and largely undermining Hamas’s capabilities in Gaza over more than a year of war.</p><p>As it intensified its focus on the Houthis, Israel has also kept up what Mr. Netanyahu has called a deliberately “relentless” campaign against Hamas. On Thursday, Gaza’s health ministry said that an Israeli airstrike near Kamal Adwan Hospital had killed 50 people, including five hospital staff members, some of whom died while trying to rescue the injured.</p><p>Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospital’s director, said people were still buried under the rubble. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Israeli military’s attack in Yemen on Thursday targeted not just the airport in Sana, a Houthi stronghold, but also the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations. Israel described the targets as “military infrastructure used by the Houthi terrorist regime for its military activities.” The jets also struck military infrastructure in the Al-Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports on Yemen’s western coast, the military said.</p><p>The director general of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said <a href="https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1872316621542592924" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a social media post</a> that “the airport came under aerial bombardment” as he and other United Nations officials were about to board a plane there, and that a crew member was injured.</p><p>“The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge — just a few meters from where we were — and the runway were damaged,” he wrote, but added that he and his W.H.O. colleagues were safe. They had been on a mission to negotiate the release of detained U.N. staff and to assess the health and humanitarian situation in Yemen, he wrote.</p><p>A spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said that Israel had no previous knowledge that the W.H.O. director general would be at the airport at the time of the attack. “We didn’t know,” he said. “We wish him well.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="israel-attack-yemen-map" data-id="100000009897251" data-source-id="100000009897251"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Where Israel Attacked Yemen on Thursday</h2></header><div slug="israel-attack-yemen-map" data-sourceid="100000009897251" id="embed-id-100000009897251">
