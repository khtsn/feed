And even if it takes time, this lesson will be understood across the Middle East.”</p><p>On Thursday after the Israeli strikes, Mr. Netanyahu said in <a href="https://x.com/Now14Israel/status/1872351668659995136" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview</a> with an Israeli TV station of the Houthis: “We are just getting started with them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At least four people were killed and 21 others injured in the attack on Thursday after Israel struck the international airport in Sana and the city of Al Hodeidah, the Saba state news agency said, citing Yemen’s Health Ministry. The report could not be independently verified.</p><p>Since Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the Israeli military has not only decimated the Palestinian group in Gaza, but it has also bombed other Iran-backed proxies in the region, wiping out most of the leadership of the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon after the group began rocket launches into Israel in solidarity with Hamas. Israel has also hit sites in Syria that it said hosted Hezbollah infrastructure. And Israel has struck Iran itself in retaliation for the huge barrages of missiles and drones that Iran launched against Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
