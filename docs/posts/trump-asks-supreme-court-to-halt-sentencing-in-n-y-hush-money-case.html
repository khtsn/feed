Trump is seeking a late-stage rescue from the U.S. Supreme Court, escalating his bid to shut down the case before he returns to the White House.</p><p>In an emergency petition filed late Tuesday, Mr. Trump’s lawyers urged the high court to intervene and halt the sentencing, which is scheduled for Friday, 10 days before the presidential inauguration.</p><p>The filing came after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/nyregion/trump-criminal-sentencing-appeal.html" title="">a New York appeals court rejected the same request on Tuesday</a>, casting doubt on the validity of his effort to stave off the sentencing.</p><p>The effort hinges on Mr. Trump’s argument that he is entitled to full immunity from prosecution, and even sentencing, now that he is the president-elect. His lawyers have based that claim on a polarizing Supreme Court ruling from last year that granted former presidents broad immunity for their official acts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This court should enter an immediate stay of further proceedings in the New York trial court,” the application said, “to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.”</p><p>The Supreme Court directed prosecutors to respond to Mr. Trump’s application by Thursday morning, an indication that the justices may act before the scheduled sentencing on Friday.</p><p>It capped a whirlwind stretch of legal wrangling for the former and future president, who is scrambling to avoid the embarrassing spectacle of a public sentencing.</p><p>Although Mr. Trump is expected to receive nothing more than a slap on the wrist — the trial judge overseeing the case <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/nyregion/trump-sentencing-hush-money-case-ny.html" title="">has signaled that he would spare Mr. Trump jail time</a> — the sentencing carries symbolic importance. It would formalize Mr. Trump’s status as a felon, making him the first president to hold that dubious designation.</p><p>If the Supreme Court grants a stay of Mr. Trump’s sentencing, it might effectively scuttle the proceeding for good. The window to sentence Mr. Trump is rapidly closing — once he returns to the White House, Mr. Trump cannot face criminal prosecution — and he would be 82 after his second term concludes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, writing about public corruption.
