    <h1>Trump Asks Supreme Court to Halt Sentencing in N.Y. Hush-Money Case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“This court should enter an immediate stay of further proceedings in the New York trial court,” the application said, “to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.”</p><p>The Supreme Court directed prosecutors to respond to Mr. Trump’s application by Thursday morning, an indication that the justices may act before the scheduled sentencing on Friday.</p><p>It capped a whirlwind stretch of legal wrangling for the former and future president, who is scrambling to avoid the embarrassing spectacle of a public sentencing.</p><p>Although Mr. Trump is expected to receive nothing more than a slap on the wrist — the trial judge overseeing the case <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/nyregion/trump-sentencing-hush-money-case-ny.html" title="">has signaled that he would spare Mr. Trump jail time</a> — the sentencing carries symbolic importance. It would formalize Mr. Trump’s status as a felon, making him the first president to hold that dubious designation.</p><p>If the Supreme Court grants a stay of Mr. Trump’s sentencing, it might effectively scuttle the proceeding for good. The window to sentence Mr. Trump is rapidly closing — once he returns to the White House, Mr. Trump cannot face criminal prosecution — and he would be 82 after his second term concludes.</p></div></div>
