Warmer temperatures and thinning ice make it increasingly likely that it will soon be possible in the summers for ships to regularly travel from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean by way of an Arctic route known as the Northwest Passage.</p><p>Canada’s government said the country was committed to increasing military spending in the Arctic, including a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/world/canada/canada-norad-air-defense.html" title="">5 billion Canadian dollar, or $3.6 billion, upgrade</a> of defense systems used by the North American Aerospace Defense Command — a joint operation of the two countries.</p><p>“It is clear that Russia has no red lines, its designs on the Arctic and its resources are well known,” Mélanie Joly, the foreign minister said in announcing the policy on Friday. “But what is new<span>  </span>is that Russia is increasingly dependent on China because of its war in Ukraine.”</p><p>A warming Arctic climate is already playing havoc in the region. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/americas/canada-arctic-permafrost-thawing.html" title="">Melting permafrost</a> threatens coastal communities with inundation and unstable sea ice is limiting the ability of the Inuit, who dominate the region, to hunt.</p><p>China has already declared its interest in becoming an Arctic power and many experts say that may be partly driven by the prospect of an expansion of mining being made commercially viable by a less icy Arctic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>China, which also has an Arctic cooperation agreement with Russia, regularly sends “dual purpose” ships into the area to conduct scientific research and to collect military intelligence, according to Canada’s government.</p><p>It also listed a number of joint military exercises by China and Russia, as well as Chinese incursions into airspace patrolled by the United States, to underscore how the Arctic is become an increasingly active theater of global competition.</p><p>While the Canadian government said that “close partnership with the United States is essential to the maintenance of a secure, strong and well-defended North American homeland,” it also doubles down on a longstanding Arctic dispute between the two countries.</p><p>The United States and several other countries regard the Northwest Passage as <a href="https://www.navalassoc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BN-Arctic-Sovereignty.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">international waters.</a> But the Canadian government’s statement reiterates the position that “the waters of Canada’s Arctic Archipelago, including the various channels comprising the Northwest Passage, are internal waters of Canada by virtue of historic title and in accordance with international law.”</p><p>The statement does, however, commit Canada to resolving another dispute with the United States over a portion of the Beaufort Sea now claimed by both countries but offers no details on how that will be achieved. And it commits Canada to working out the final details with Denmark over the border of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/world/canada/hans-island-ownership-canada-denmark.html" title="">tiny, uninhabited island</a> both countries claim.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Canada also plans to revive the office of Arctic ambassador and open diplomatic posts in Alaska and Greenland. The ambassador, who will be an Indigenous person, would be Canada’s top Arctic official and would work with Indigenous groups and governments throughout the region.</p><p>Natan Obed, the president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national body for the largest group of Indigenous people living in the high Arctic, said he was pleased that the government had consulted Indigenous groups in forming its policy.</p><p>Still, he said, he believed that a key step for Canada to increase its presence in the region must be to significantly improve the infrastructure.</p><p>He said that 49 of the 51 Inuit communities in the high Arctic lack road connections to anywhere else in the region. </p><p>The communities also, Mr. Obed added, lack deep seaports, leaving them accessible only by airfields built mainly during World War II and the Cold War that are now often in poor repair. Sewer and water systems are also inadequate in many Inuit settlements.</p><p>“If Canada wants to assert its sovereignty it needs to deal with the basics,” Mr. Obed said. “There is a long way to go and I hope this isn’t lost on the Canadian government.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
