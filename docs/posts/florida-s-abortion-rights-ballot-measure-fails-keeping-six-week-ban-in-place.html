    <h1>Florida’s Abortion Rights Ballot Measure Fails, Keeping Six-Week Ban in Place</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Florida measure’s failure is a political victory for Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who had become the face of a well-funded and well-organized opposition campaign. He spent much of his political capital, and considerable state resources, to defeat it. Another ballot measure that Mr. DeSantis and his allies strongly opposed, which would have legalized marijuana in the state, was also defeated.</p><p>Mr. DeSantis and Republican lawmakers enacted a 15-week abortion ban in 2022 and the six-week ban in 2023. Florida had previously allowed abortions up to 24 weeks and had been a destination for women in other Southern states with stricter laws.</p><p>Organizers of the Yes on 4 campaign raised more than $100 million to get the measure on the ballot and campaign for it, knowing it would be a difficult battle. Though similar measures have passed in other conservative states, Florida’s 60 percent threshold is higher. Going into Election Day, polls showed support hovering around 60 percent.</p><p>The nonpartisan Yes on 4 campaign knew that it would need support from Democrats, Republicans and voters with no party affiliation. Organizers hoped that enough Republican-leaning voters would vote yes even if they also supported anti-abortion candidates.</p><p>Former President Donald J. Trump, a Florida resident, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/us/politics/trump-florida-abortion-measure.html" title="">had opposed Amendment 4</a>, after initially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/us/trump-florida-abortion-rights.html" title="">suggesting that he might support it</a>.</p><p>Eric Adelson<!-- --> contributed reporting from Orlando, Fla., <!-- -->Elisabeth Parker<!-- --> from St. Petersburg, Fla., and <!-- -->Kate Zernike<!-- --> from New Jersey.</p></div></div>
