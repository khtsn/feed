The authorities in Valencia said they had created a phone line to report missing people and urged residents not to travel along the still-submerged roads in the area.</p><p>Though storms are typical during the fall in Spain, local residents were shocked at the amount of rain — about 40 to 50 gallons per square yard, according to Spain’s meteorological agency. Forecasters said that the storm was moving toward the north and northwest of Spain, with rain expected to continue until at least Thursday.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section></article></div>
