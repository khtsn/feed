    <h1>A History of the Chicago DNC Protests in 1968</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>It was August 1968, and Chicago was ready to combust.<strong> </strong>The Democratic National Convention had come to town, along with thousands of delegates, guests and journalists. Demonstrators arrived in the city ready for battle, protesting the United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War, which by then had <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/casualty-statistics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed</a> more than 25,000 Americans. Mayor Richard J. Daley, who had seen the West Side of his city burn months earlier after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., was determined to protect the city’s residents from more unrest — and crack down on protesters who were furious at the war, the draft and the deaths of their peers.</p><p>And he did. Over several days, protesters and the police clashed on the streets in rioting that was captured on national television. Authorities used tear gas, called in the National Guard and arrested hundreds of demonstrators, often with brutal force.</p></div></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="1968-dnc-protests" data-id="100000009634808" data-source-id="100000009634808"><div data-sourceid="100000009634808" id="embed-id-100000009634808">

</div></section></div><div><p>There are some unmistakable parallels between that convention and the one beginning on Monday in Chicago: an overseas conflict stirring disapproval at home, a wave of campus demonstrations and a new Democratic presidential nominee taking the stage.</p></div><div><div><p>But the comparisons end there, many people who remember 1968 said. The turmoil and tension leading into the 1968 convention in Chicago were far different from this year’s, which is now characterized by Vice President Kamala Harris’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/politics/kamala-harris-walz-joy.html" title="">campaign</a> of optimism. Police officers have been trained to protect protesters’ First Amendment rights and to de-escalate situations — and the current mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, who has joined labor protests in the past, is part of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Still, the chaos of 1968 remains vivid. Here are recollections of what happened, as told by the activists, journalists, police officers and other observers who lived it. Some comments have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/19/us/19nat-dnc-oralhistory-ng/19nat-dnc-oralhistory-ng-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/19/us/19nat-dnc-oralhistory-ng/19nat-dnc-oralhistory-ng-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/19/us/19nat-dnc-oralhistory-ng/19nat-dnc-oralhistory-ng-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A black-and-white image of people sitting and lying on a lawn.

These events heightened emotions and created a sense of unrest in the air. People were on edge.” </p><p><strong>William M. Daley, a son of then-Mayor Richard J. Daley, who was 20 years old at the time and accompanied his father around the city.</strong></p><p>“It was one of the most challenging years in the history of the country. Everybody played their part: the demonstrators, the police, my dad. You had a weekend of violence and people throwing stink bombs in hotel lobbies. You had police chasing demonstrators around Lincoln Park. You had this crazy stuff going on. In addition to the madness of thousands of people coming to Chicago to demonstrate, there was a rumor that they were going to put LSD in the water supply. We laugh at that today, but in the context of ’68, it wasn’t crazy. The cops had had enough.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>William M.

They were making fun of people.&#34;</p><p><strong>Don Rose, spokesman, National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam</strong></p><p>“There was a lot of nervousness. We had planned a number of protests. It was supposed to be beyond the war and hit civil rights and other issues. But most of the feeling was about the war and the draft.”</p><p><strong>Michael Klonsky, national secretary, Students for a Democratic Society</strong></p></div></div><div><p>“We felt the real change in the war and civil rights would not come from the top. We weren’t so much invested in the Democratic victory over Richard Nixon. Most of the young activists in our organization were tired of the war, opposed to the draft, and they were not going to vote for the war party, which is what the Democrats were then, and to a large degree are now. We followed what was going on with the debate inside the convention, but what we wanted to do was impact that debate from the streets.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Chicago’s International Amphitheatre, delegates crowd around the stage on the floor of the Democratic convention.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the New York delegation at the convention protest against the Vietnam War. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Washington Bureau/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-6788eeb0">Clashes between police and protesters</h2><p><em>Inside the convention hall, Democrats nominated Vice President Hubert Humphrey over Senator Eugene McCarthy, 1,761 votes to 601.

For many Americans, the unrest during the convention diminished faith in the Democratic Party to preserve order in the nation. That November, the country elected Mr. Nixon president over Mr. Humphrey. But the antiwar movement continued to grow.</em></p><p><strong>Judy Gumbo, a founding member of the </strong><strong><a href="https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yippies</a></strong></p><p>“The sight of the cops coming into Grant Park with their batons, slapping them against their sides and marching in, really roughing people up, doing terrible stuff to people, was an amazing sight. It was scary, but I don’t remember the scary as much as I remember the empowerment. The feeling of, ‘We are doing the right thing.’” </p><p><strong>William M. Daley</strong></p><p>“My dad was the defender of the system; he was the mayor. It was his job to keep order and control of the city. Nobody was killed, and there were no riots in the neighborhoods, which was his big concern. He was worried there would be a replication of what happened after Martin Luther King died.&#34; </p><p><strong>Klonsky</strong></p><p>“The protest in ’68 really helped sway public opinion on the war movement and the draft.
