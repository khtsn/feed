When I made my way through the noise, smoke and dust to take photographs, I came upon a scene of the dead and the dying.</p><p>Those who had survived were trying to aid one another as best they could. The wounded woman seen in this photograph was carried away to a hospital moments later.</p><p>But at least one hospital was unable to accommodate the high number of casualties on Wednesday, according to the health ministry, which put the day’s death toll across the enclave at 59. Its casualty figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.</p><p>Asked about the target of the attack, the Israeli military said in a statement on Thursday that its forces had “struck two key Hamas terrorists” in the Gaza City area.</p><p>“Prior to the strike,” it said, “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming uninvolved civilians, including the use of a precise munition, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.”</p><p>Israel was “aware,” the statement said, “of the claim of casualties.”</p><p>The strikes followed the collapse in March of a cease-fire between the Israelis and Hamas, which set off the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The Israeli military says it is expanding its operations in Gaza to force Hamas to release the remaining hostages seized in that attack.</p><p>Outside the cafe on Wednesday, Gazans despaired at the return of war.</p><p>“Enough, enough of the bloodshed happening,” said one witness, Ahmed al-Saoudi.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/world/08gaza-oneimage-ender/08gaza-oneimage-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/world/08gaza-oneimage-ender/08gaza-oneimage-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/world/08gaza-oneimage-ender/08gaza-oneimage-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/world/08gaza-oneimage-ender/08gaza-oneimage-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/world/08gaza-oneimage-ender/08gaza-oneimage-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/world/08gaza-oneimage-ender/08gaza-oneimage-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/world/08gaza-oneimage-ender/08gaza-oneimage-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b3075303-25b0-5a9f-83a5-2497f2cce2c6" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Written by <!-- -->Peter Robins<!-- -->.
