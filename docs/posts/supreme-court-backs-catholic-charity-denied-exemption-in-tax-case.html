The state court, she wrote, had run afoul of the Constitution by imposing “a denominational preference by differentiating between religions based on theological choices.”</p><p>The case was one of three concerning religion heard by the justices this term, and it extended a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/politics/supreme-court-religion.html" title="">remarkable winning streak</a> at the court for religious people and groups.</p><p>Another case, about whether parents in Maryland have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/supreme-court-lgbtq-books.html" title="">a religious right to withdraw their children from classes</a> when books with gay and transgender themes are discussed, will be decided in the coming weeks.</p><p>In the third case, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/supreme-court-religious-charter-school-oklahoma.html" title="">the justices deadlocked</a> in May by a 4-to-4 vote over whether a Catholic charter school in Oklahoma passed constitutional muster, letting stand a state court ruling against the school but setting no national precedent.</p><p>The Wisconsin case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-154.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Catholic Charities Bureau v. Wisconsin Labor &amp; Industry Review Commission</a>, No. 24-154,<strong> </strong>concerned a state law that exempts religious groups from state unemployment taxes so long as they are “operated primarily for religious purposes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Catholic Charities Bureau, the social ministry of the Catholic Diocese in Superior, Wis., has said its mission is to provide “services to the poor and disadvantaged as an expression of the social ministry of the Catholic Church.” But state officials determined that the charity did not qualify for the exemption because it “provides essentially secular services and engages in activities that are not religious per se.”</p><p>When the case was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/supreme-court-catholic-charity.html" title="">argued in March</a>, a lawyer for the state acknowledged that the charity would qualify for the exemption if it were part of the church rather than a separate corporation. But he said there must be principles that separate religious institutions from others.</p><p>In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said that was a separate reason to rule for the charity. Courts have no business second-guessing churches’ decisions about how to organize themselves, he said.</p><p>“The First Amendment’s guarantee of church autonomy,” Justice Thomas wrote, “gives religious institutions the right to define their internal governance structures without state interference.”</p><p>Eric Rassbach, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the charity, welcomed the decision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Wisconsin shouldn’t have picked this fight in the first place,” he said. “It was always absurd to claim that Catholic Charities wasn’t religious because it helps everyone, no matter their religion.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
