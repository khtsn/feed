After 13 years of civil war, Syria’s rebel fighters have stormed the capital, Damascus, and claimed victory.</p><p>The government’s forces fled without significant resistance as rebel fighters poured into the city. Assad resigned and left Syria, Russia said, but his location could not be confirmed. The rebels appear to have taken over the state television, and they announced Syria to be “free of the tyrant.” </p><p>The country’s prime minister, who remains in Damascus, said he would work on a transition government. The rebels called on their forces to stay away from public institutions until they could be formally handed over.</p><p>The rebels said they are now continuing their advance into the east. Below, we explain what has happened and what may come next.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Areas of control as of 10 p.m. local time Saturday.

(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/briefing/syria-civil-war-assad.html" title="">Read The Morning’s explanation of the war</a>.)</p><p>Until recently, a coalition of rebel groups had been stuck, pinned into a corner of Syria’s northwest. Then they blazed through the country and took its major cities, including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. They freed people inside many of the Assad regime’s prisons, where he had for decades tortured and executed political prisoners. This weekend, the rebels poured into Damascus.</p><p>As rebels entered the city, Syrian government troops reportedly peeled off their uniforms and fled their posts. Gunfire sounded in the city overnight as the rebels celebrated, witnesses said. People left their homes to join them.</p><p>Residents stomped burning images of Assad and attempted to topple a statue of his father. (The Assad family has ruled Syria for five decades.) They were unsuccessful in taking down the statue, but left a trash can on its head. As some celebrated, others mourned all they had lost during years of war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“No one should shed any tears over the end of the Assad regime,” Daniel Shapiro, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said.</p><h2 id="link-29e3a6d9">What comes next</h2><p>It’s unclear how the rebels’ victory could reshape the Middle East.</p><p>Syria’s neighbors are bracing for instability. Israel’s military said it had entered a demilitarized buffer zone in territory it controls next to Syria. Iraq has secured its border with Syria, according to the official Iraqi News Agency.</p><p>The collapse of the Assad family’s long rule <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/assads-rule-collapses-in-syria-raising-concerns-of-a-vacuum-95568f13?mod=WSJ_home_mediumtopper_pos_2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could create a dangerous vacuum</a>, The Wall Street Journal reports, and outside powers may maneuver for influence. Assad contained rebel forces for more than a decade with Iranian and Russian backing. But in recent days, Iran and Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/08/world/syria-war-damascus/us-national-security-adviser-says-syria-has-been-abandoned-by-its-key-allies?smid=url-share" title="">withheld significant military support</a>.</p><p>The rebels’ victory could cause some of the millions of Syrian refugees who fled during the past decade to return home.</p><p>It’s also unclear who may govern Syria — or what that rule could look like. The leading rebel group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, is a Sunni Muslim organization once affiliated with Al Qaeda.

In her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/books/review/rental-house-weike-wang.html" title="">third novel</a>, we follow a New York couple on two vacations several years apart — first to a humble cabin on the Cape, then to a tricked out bungalow in the Catskills. Keru and Nate’s visitors, menus, outings, even the behavior of a beloved sheepdog tell you everything you need to know about the state of their relationship, which comes with more baggage than an airport carousel.

We talked about, among many other things, a creeping meanness in the world as well as the intersection of art, life and political action.</em></p><p><strong>I used to feel as if consuming art was sufficient when it came to forming a political identity and political engagement. Now I think I should have spent more time and energy out in the street and less time and energy in the theater or with headphones on. I’m rambling, but these are things I’ve been thinking about.</strong></p><p>I’m liking everything you’re saying, and I’m surfing the wave of it. It’s not a ramble at all. The real question is: Who are we and how must we live? I don’t necessarily want to designate one thing as political activism and another as artistic practice and another as living your life. For me, there ain’t no walls between any of them. Does that explain the attitude?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>The life came first.</strong></p><p>The life always comes first, and the work comes out of the life. Here’s another thing that I wanted to say: this is a huge thing, this is a bombshell I’m going to lay down.</p><p><strong>Go for it.</strong></p><p>I wonder whether art isn’t a call to our innate goodness — an opportunity to connect with the empathy machine that cinema is. Since we’ve talked about the rise of the meanness of right-wing politics — let’s use a word that is appropriate here: meanness. What oil might get through that grease? I don’t want to assume that anybody else believes in innate goodness, but I’m declaring that I do. I do believe we were all little children, scared little animals once, including all of those people that we’re thinking about. I don’t know what happened to them to make them this mean, but we have to contact them somehow.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/magazine/tilda-swinton-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id="link-640bc3b8"><span><strong>THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p><strong>Click the cover image above to read this week’s magazine.</strong></p><h3 id="link-7fc2b962"><span><strong>THE MORNING RECOMMENDS …</strong></span></h3><p><strong>Decorate </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/realestate/holiday-mantel-decor-bunny-williams.html" title="">your mantel</a> for the holidays.</p><p><strong>Stream </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/movies/horror-movies-streaming.html" title="">these horror movies</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Julia Gartland for The New York Times.
