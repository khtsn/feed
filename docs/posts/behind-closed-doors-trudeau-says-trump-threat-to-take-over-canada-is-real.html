Mr. Trudeau’s office declined to provide details of what the prime minister said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They’re very aware of our resources,” Mr. Trudeau added, “of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those.”</p><p>And he continued: “But Mr. Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has been talking about annexing Canada for weeks as he has laid the groundwork for plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Trump agreed to a 30-day reprieve on tariffs after Canada pledged to adopt a more stringent plan to secure its border with the United States.</p><p>During comments to reporters that day in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump again raised the statehood issue. “What I’d like to see, Canada become our 51st state,” he said. “I’d love to see that, but some people say that would be a long shot,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Canada is home to 31 minerals considered critical for use in various industries, including for electric car batteries, solar panels and semiconductors. Of those, Canada is prioritizing lithium, graphite, nickel, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements as part of a strategy to position itself as a leader in the global transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>The supply chain is deeply integrated, and the health of the U.S. economy depends on Canada, said François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister.</p><p>“This is about a confident Canada,” Mr. Champagne told reporters at Friday’s meeting.</p><p>As part of its plan to fend off tariffs, Canada is implementing a border security plan in response to Mr. Trump’s accusations that the country is contributing to “massive” fentanyl trafficking to the United States, even though Canada is responsible for a tiny fraction of the fentanyl crossing the border.</p><p>Those measures include 10,000 personnel assigned to the border, along with helicopters, drones and canine teams. The government also said it would name a “fentanyl czar” to lead the response.</p><p>“We need to be very deliberate about how we continue to engage closely with the United States to make the case and demonstrate that Canada is responsible for a tiny part of the North American fentanyl problem,’’ Mr. Trudeau told the business leaders, “but that we are also bitterly touched by this tragedy.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vjosa Isai is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Toronto, where she covers news from across Canada.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vjosa-isai">More about Vjosa Isai</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
