    <h1>Behind Closed Doors, Trudeau Says Trump Threat to Take Over Canada Is Real</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Canada is home to 31 minerals considered critical for use in various industries, including for electric car batteries, solar panels and semiconductors. Of those, Canada is prioritizing lithium, graphite, nickel, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements as part of a strategy to position itself as a leader in the global transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>The supply chain is deeply integrated, and the health of the U.S. economy depends on Canada, said François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister.</p><p>“This is about a confident Canada,” Mr. Champagne told reporters at Friday’s meeting.</p><p>As part of its plan to fend off tariffs, Canada is implementing a border security plan in response to Mr. Trump’s accusations that the country is contributing to “massive” fentanyl trafficking to the United States, even though Canada is responsible for a tiny fraction of the fentanyl crossing the border.</p><p>Those measures include 10,000 personnel assigned to the border, along with helicopters, drones and canine teams. The government also said it would name a “fentanyl czar” to lead the response.</p><p>“We need to be very deliberate about how we continue to engage closely with the United States to make the case and demonstrate that Canada is responsible for a tiny part of the North American fentanyl problem,’’ Mr. Trudeau told the business leaders, “but that we are also bitterly touched by this tragedy.”</p></div></div>
