On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could afford to compromise because a deal in Lebanon would not significantly weaken his grip on power at home.</p><p>A breakthrough in Gaza is harder to achieve because Hamas still holds roughly 100 hostages, a significant trump card that allows the group’s top negotiator, Khalil Al-Hayya, to maintain a hard-line negotiating position. In Israel, Mr. Netanyahu cannot compromise with Hamas because doing so might collapse his ruling coalition, forcing early elections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition allies, many of whom hope to settle Gaza with Jewish civilians after the war, have threatened to abandon his alliance if the conflict there ends without Hamas’s complete defeat. When it came to Lebanon, Mr. Netanyahu was under less domestic pressure to deliver a knockout blow to Hezbollah, even if many Israelis — including much of his base — remained deeply concerned about the long-term threat posed by the group.</p><p>“The Lebanon deal happened because Netanyahu wanted it and Hezbollah needed it — and because it wasn’t a deal breaker for Netanyahu’s coalition,” said Aaron David Miller, an American analyst and former negotiator in previous Mideast peace talks. “The Gaza deal is different,” he said.</p><p>Still, both U.S. and Israeli leaders expressed optimism that the Lebanon deal could be a turning point.</p><p>In announcing the Lebanon truce on Tuesday, President Biden said he hoped the agreement would lead to renewed momentum in parallel negotiations over Gaza. He repeated that promise in a social media post on Wednesday, pledging “another push” for a Gaza deal, even though talks have been stalled for months.</p><p>In Israel, Mr. Netanyahu suggested that Hezbollah’s withdrawal from the fight might isolate its ally Hamas and force the group to back down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Hamas was counting on Hezbollah to fight by its side,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a recorded speech on Tuesday night. “With Hezbollah out of the picture, Hamas is left on its own. We will increase our pressure on Hamas and that will help us in our sacred mission of releasing our hostages.”</p><p>But Palestinian analysts said that Hamas, having already weathered many serious setbacks over the past year, was unlikely to suddenly give up the hostages or relinquish power in Gaza. Though Hamas’s leadership has been decimated and ordinary Gazans yearn for an end to the suffering, the group’s remaining leaders are holding out for a deal that would allow the group to survive the war intact.</p><p>To that end, Hamas issued a statement on Wednesday, shortly after the Lebanon truce took hold, in which it repeated its core demand for Israel to permanently withdraw from Gaza. Since the killing last month of Yahya Sinwar, the group’s strongman leader, Hamas has said that it is being governed by a five-person leadership council — which appears to have maintained Mr. Sinwar’s aversion to compromise.</p><p>“I really do not think the cease-fire in Lebanon will have any impact on Gaza,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a Palestinian political scientist displaced from his home in Gaza City. There is “no light at the end of the black tunnel for Gaza,” he added.</p><p>Gaza is partly stuck in limbo because the Israeli military, despite decimating much of the enclave and killing tens of thousands of people, has avoided holding and governing most of the land it has captured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Instead, Israeli forces have usually retreated soon after defeating local Hamas battalions, allowing the group’s surviving members to return to fill the vacuum.</p><p>Ending that cycle, either through a diplomatic compromise or a decisive battlefield victory, would require Mr. Netanyahu to set out a plan for Gaza’s postwar future, something he has been reluctant to do. That is partly because it would force him to choose between the goals of his domestic partners and those of his potential foreign allies.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has said it could normalize its ties with Israel if Israel allows the formation of a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. But Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition partners oppose a Palestinian state.</p><p>A deal with Saudi Arabia would give Mr. Netanyahu a landmark foreign policy victory, somewhat salvaging his legacy domestically after presiding over one of the biggest security failures in Israeli history — the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>But the collapse of his coalition would endanger his domestic influence, potentially making Mr. Netanyahu more vulnerable to an ongoing corruption investigation. Since 2020, Mr. Netanyahu has stood trial on charges of bribery and fraud, accusations that he strongly denies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Against that backdrop, some analysts said, Mr. Netanyahu will be even warier of angering his base, particularly after spending political capital on a Lebanon deal.</p><p>He is now “less likely” to cede ground over Gaza, according to Michael Koplow, an analyst at Israel Policy Forum, a New York-based research group.</p><p>“If anything this will cause them to ramp up the pressure on him even more not to let up on Hamas in ways they would consider to be premature,” Mr. Koplow said.</p><p>Still, pressure works both ways.</p><p>Israeli commentators have speculated that Mr. Netanyahu agreed to compromise in Lebanon because he feared that Mr. Biden might freeze arms supplies or withdraw diplomatic support for Israel at the United Nations Security Council. (In a press briefing on Tuesday, a senior Biden administration official denied it had made such a threat.)</p><p>In the final weeks of Barack Obama’s presidency, the Obama administration broke with U.S. diplomatic policy and declined to veto a U.N. resolution that criticized Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“That was a big trauma for Netanyahu and he is afraid that it will happen again under Biden,” said Mazal Mualem, a biographer of Mr. Netanyahu and a commentator on Israeli politics. “He knows there are still two months left in the Biden administration and he needs to be careful,” she added.</p><p>Now, some Israelis hope that Mr. Netanyahu, having brushed off his supporters’ opposition to a deal in Lebanon, will be motivated to do the same with a compromise in Gaza.</p><p>For the families of hostages held in Gaza, a diplomatic arrangement appears to be their relatives’ best chance of leaving the territory alive — and they are now amplifying their calls for a hostage release deal.</p><p>For now, though, Mr. Netanyahu appears to have bought himself some time, according to Ms. Mualem, the prime minister’s biographer.</p><p>“Netanyahu is always buying time and maneuvering,” Ms. Mualem said. “Yesterday, he bought time until President Trump takes office.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
