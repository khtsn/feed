When Mr. Harkin, a prairie populist who has since retired, spotted Mr. Cruz, a right-wing firebrand, walking down the boat’s ramp, Mr. Manchin recalled, the Iowan balked. “I don’t think I can do this,” he quoted Mr. Harkin saying. “I don’t think we can be on the same boat.”</p><p>But soon enough, the Iowan and Texan got to talking.

It really happened on the boat. A lot of things happened on the boat. Anyway, I had invited like I’ve done a lot and senators down — we had senators coming down one day and they were walking down. And Tom Harkin, a very, very progressive senator from Iowa, good friend, he was there. And he said, “Joe, it’s the first time I’ve ever been down on the Potomac River.” And about that time he saw, he saw Ted Cruz walking down the ramp to get on the boat. He said, “Joe, I don’t think I can do this.” I said, “What?” He said, “I just don’t think we can be on the same boat together.” I said, “Come on, Tom, give it a shot.” Ted got on the boat. Tom and before you knew it, they started talking. I don’t know what they were talking about. Probably wasn’t politics, but by the end of that day, the next day, they started working on some amendments together and doing legislation and — that’s just the power of sitting down and listening and getting to know each other. And we don’t do that much here.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/13vid-senate-final-speeches-76234-cover/13vid-senate-final-speeches-76234-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>C-SPAN</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Mr. Manchin, independent of West Virginia, sharing a story about hosting two political opponents on his boat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His remarks were part of a time-honored Senate ritual that is unfolding in the final days of Congress as lawmakers wind down their legislative work for the year. Departing senators — those who, like Mr. Manchin, are voluntarily retiring as well as those who lost their re-election bids last month — take to the floor for one final farewell address. Akin to an office-party goodbye, only these are delivered at the Capitol and televised live on C-SPAN.</p><p>The speeches and tributes, most of which have lasted close to an hour, contain all the hallmarks of the tradition-bound Senate. They are part victory lap, part nostalgic reminiscence, part legacy-burnishing and — fittingly for a chamber that exalts self-indulgent oratory — always long-winded.</p><p>They feature thank-yous to staff and family, praise for colleagues, dishing about the backroom dealing that makes the Senate run — and sometimes a touch of bitterness or regret from those whose voters effectively fired them at the polls.</p><p>“Quite frankly, if I shed a tear up here today, it’s not because I’m emotional. It’s because my back is killing me right now, OK?” said Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, 68, who last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/elections/montana-senate-tester-sheehy.html" title="">lost a brutal</a> and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/most-expensive-races?cycle=2024&amp;display=allcandsout" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expensive</a> campaign for a fourth term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Tester was the first of three Democrats who lost re-election to give his farewell speech, and some of his staff aides and family members dabbed away tears as they watched from the gallery and outer edges of the Senate floor.</p><p>“Look, I’ve seen a number of these exit speeches,” Mr. Tester said. “And to be honest with you, they remind me a bit of an obituary.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-6"><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Senator Jon Tester compares Senate farewell speeches to obituaries.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>And one of the things I did yesterday was play basketball due to the influence of my bald-headed chief of staff, Dylan Laslovich, and my legislative director, Justin Folsom, who I have no comments for, and quite frankly — so if I shed a tear while I’m up here today, it won’t be because I’m emotional. It’s because my back is killing me right now, OK. Look, I’ve seen a number of these exit speeches. To be honest with you, they remind me a bit of an obituary.

Mr. Romney, a former governor and presidential candidate, griped about the ever-changing floor schedule, the “15-minute votes” that regularly last more than an hour, and the “show votes” leveraged by the party in power to score political points rather than pass substantive policy.</p><p>“The truth is, while I might not miss the Senate itself terribly much,” Mr. Romney said, “I will very much miss you, my fellow senators.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-9"><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Senator Mitt Romney shares what he will miss, and not miss, about the U.S. Senate.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>And the truth is that while I may not miss the Senate itself terribly much — the 10-minute votes that last an hour, the unknowable schedule of votes, the myriad meaningless votes, the absurd passion about inconsequential votes — I will very much miss you, my fellow senators.

A Utah water conservation project had been deleted from the text of the measure, Mr. Romney recalled, and Mr. Tester pushed the other senators in their group to reprint the entire bill and add it back. Others argued that Mr. Romney should fix the issue himself by offering an amendment to the bill once it reached the floor, but Mr. Tester knew that could fail or become a political liability for Mr. Romney. </p><p>“Jon Tester stood up and said, ‘No, this is going to hurt Mitt; it’s not fair. We’ve got to fix this,’” Mr. Romney said. “He stood up for me, and convinced the other members of our group to do something that was not in their interest — not in his interest — but in my interest,” he added, “because he was a man — he is a man — of character, and a friend.”</p><p>That quality of character, Mr. Romney said, was what prompted him to repeatedly ask Mr. Tester to consider running for president in Joe Biden’s place earlier this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-12"><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Senator Mitt Romney shares a story of working with Senator Jon Tester on the bipartisan infrastructure bill.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>I wanted Jon Tester to be the next president of the United States, because he’s a man of such extraordinary character. I learned something about that character when we worked together. He mentioned the infrastructure bill that I had the privilege of joining him to help negotiate. There was a time towards the very, very end when I made a beginner’s mistake. I’m just a freshman senator, after all, and I was about to do something which would be harmful for my political career and my welcome back be home, and might even helpful to the opposition forces. And everybody was telling me, don’t worry about this. We can paper it over later. Don’t worry. Don’t worry. And Jon Tester stood up and said, no, this is going to hurt Mitt. It’s not fair. We’ve got to fix this. I didn’t know that. But he stood up for me and convinced the other members of our group to do something that was not in their interest, not in his interest, but in my interest because he was a man — he is a man — of character and a friend.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/13vid-senate-final-speeches-RomneyTester-17553-cover/13vid-senate-final-speeches-RomneyTester-17553-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>C-SPAN</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Mr. Romney discussing working with Mr. Tester on the bipartisan infrastructure bill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, urged his colleagues to channel Mr. Romney — the only Republican who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his first impeachment trial — whenever they found themselves pulled between political pressure and their own core values.</p><p>“As we solve problems that can only be solved by people on both sides of the aisle coming together and taking the heat that comes along with that, let’s ask ourselves over the next two or four years — what would Mitt Romney do?” Mr. Tillis said after Mr. Romney’s farewell address.</p><p>In between all the wistfulness and storytelling, senators rarely miss a chance to give one last plug to their top priorities or claim the final word on their own legacies.</p><p>In keeping with his self-proclaimed role as the king of compromise, Mr. Manchin made an impassioned plea for saving the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster threshold, which he said he believed in “with every bone in my body, every fiber in me and every ounce of blood that I have.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He also emphasized the importance of making friendships across the aisle, a talent that he cultivated as a senator and that will no doubt come in handy in his post-Senate employment.</p><p>“I hope y’all make an effort to visit with each other,” Mr. Manchin told his soon-to-be former colleagues.</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere, gang,” he added. “The boat’s still going to be there.
