    <h1>Trump Picks Former Ambassador to Mexico for Deputy Secretary of State</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Trump made the announcement about Mr. Landau in a social media post on Sunday night, saying Mr. Landau would work with Mr. Rubio “to promote our Nation’s security and prosperity through an America First Foreign Policy.”</p><p>Because of his background in dealing with Mexico, Mr. Landau could be tasked with handling migration and tariffs, which would involve coordinating with other U.S. agencies. Mr. Trump has promised to deport large numbers of undocumented immigrants. In the announcement, Mr. Trump said Mr. Landau had helped reduce illegal immigration when he was ambassador.</p><p>Mr. Landau served as Mr. Trump’s ambassador to Mexico from 2019 to 2021, when he left after Mr. Trump lost his re-election bid to President Biden. Mr. Landau works in the Washington office of the law firm Ellis George and had a three-decade career as a lawyer before becoming ambassador. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr. Landau worked as a clerk for the Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</p><p>Mr. Landau had ties to the State Department before he was appointed ambassador by Mr. Trump. He was born in Madrid, to a father who was a U.S. diplomat. His father, George Landau, later became ambassador to Paraguay, Chile and Venezuela. In his adult life, the younger Mr. Landau became a director of the Diplomacy Center Foundation, a nonprofit group that supports a museum about American diplomacy inside the State Department.</p><p>Like Mr. Landau, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of state, has a keen interest in Latin America. He is the son of Cuban immigrants, and, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he played an influential role on Venezuela policy in the first Trump administration.</p></div></div>
