Trump announced on Sunday that he had picked <a href="https://mx.usembassy.gov/u-s-ambassador-to-mexico-christopher-landau/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Christopher Landau</a>, a lawyer and former ambassador to Mexico, to be the deputy secretary of state.</p><p>If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Landau would work with the secretary of state to carry out Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, which has several core components: stemming illegal immigration, imposing tariffs to try to jump-start American manufacturing, keeping the United States out of wars and getting allies to pay for a greater share of military defense arrangements.</p><p>Mr. Trump has said he will talk with autocrats to try to reach deals, including Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-rubio-secretary-of-state.html" title="">has picked Senator Marco Rubio of Florida</a> to be secretary of state. Mr. Rubio is awaiting Senate confirmation, as is Mr. Landau.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump made the announcement about Mr. Landau in a social media post on Sunday night, saying Mr. Landau would work with Mr. Rubio “to promote our Nation’s security and prosperity through an America First Foreign Policy.”</p><p>Because of his background in dealing with Mexico, Mr. Landau could be tasked with handling migration and tariffs, which would involve coordinating with other U.S. agencies. Mr. Trump has promised to deport large numbers of undocumented immigrants. In the announcement, Mr. Trump said Mr. Landau had helped reduce illegal immigration when he was ambassador.</p><p>Mr. Landau served as Mr. Trump’s ambassador to Mexico from 2019 to 2021, when he left after Mr. Trump lost his re-election bid to President Biden. Mr. Landau works in the Washington office of the law firm Ellis George and had a three-decade career as a lawyer before becoming ambassador. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr. Landau worked as a clerk for the Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</p><p>Mr. Landau had ties to the State Department before he was appointed ambassador by Mr. Trump. He was born in Madrid, to a father who was a U.S. diplomat. His father, George Landau, later became ambassador to Paraguay, Chile and Venezuela. In his adult life, the younger Mr. Landau became a director of the Diplomacy Center Foundation, a nonprofit group that supports a museum about American diplomacy inside the State Department.</p><p>Like Mr. Landau, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of state, has a keen interest in Latin America. He is the son of Cuban immigrants, and, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he played an influential role on Venezuela policy in the first Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Landau was confirmed by the Senate to be ambassador to Mexico, and he is expected to have little problem being confirmed again for the new position.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
