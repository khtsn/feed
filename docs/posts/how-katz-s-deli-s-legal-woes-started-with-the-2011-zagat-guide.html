It can also have its downsides.</p><p>Consider Katz’s Delicatessen on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. In 2011, the Zagat New York City Restaurants guide ranked Katz’s, a palace of pastrami that opened more than a century ago and still draws long lines today, at No. 42 on its list of the city’s 50 most popular restaurants.</p><p>The honor would come back to bite.</p><p>The Zagat guide, the brainchild of the married couple Tim and Nina Zagat and a trailblazer in everyone’s-a-critic reviews long before the rise of Yelp, called Katz’s a “‘quintessential Noo Yawk’ fixture” with “‘mouthwatering’ sandwiches, latkes and kosher dogs.”</p><p>“Despite ‘zero décor’” and “‘Army-boot camp’ service,” the Katz’s entry that year continued, “fans of this ‘lovable dump’ say ‘there’s nothing else like it in the world.’”</p><p>Now, the lovable dump — famously the setting for Meg Ryan’s fake orgasm in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/travel/footsteps-when-harry-met-sally-new-york.html" title="">“When Harry Met Sally”</a> — will be getting a makeover after the owner agreed in December to bring the deli in line with federal rules governing access for disabled people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a news release on Monday, Edward Y. Kim, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said his office and the owner of Katz’s had settled a lawsuit in which the Justice Department, under an initiative begun 13 years earlier, accused the deli of violating the Americans With Disabilities Act.</p><p>Most significantly, Mr. Kim said, the main entrance, at Houston and Ludlow Streets, was not accessible; the dining area lacked tables appropriate for people with disabilities; and the restrooms did not comply with the decades-old disability law despite having been renovated in 2018.</p><p>Under the consent decree that Mr. Kim announced, Katz’s agreed to make the required renovations within the next several months. In addition, Katz’s agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, Mr. Kim said.</p><p>Jake Dell, the deli’s owner, said in a statement that “we have worked closely with the D.O.J. to ensure our restaurant is fully accessible and welcoming to all our valued customers.” Mr. Dell did not respond to questions about how much the changes would cost, whether they might affect business and why it had taken so long to resolve the matter.</p><p>The issue of A.D.A. compliance is a thorny one for the owners of many New York City restaurants, especially those housed in older buildings that can be complicated and expensive to make more accessible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, declined to hazard a guess on Tuesday as to how many of the city’s more than 25,000 eating and drinking establishments were out of compliance with the federal law or with state and city accessibility regulations.</p><p>But for small businesses with slim profit margins, Mr. Rigie said in an interview, making the changes needed to achieve compliance could be “cost prohibitive,” or it could take time for an owner to save the money required for such alterations.</p><p>To Yannick Benjamin, who has used a wheelchair since being paralyzed in a car accident in 2003, it is important that restaurants do all they can to comply with accessibility requirements.</p><p>But Mr. Benjamin, a sommelier and until December an owner of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/dining/contento-review-accessibility.html" title="">the East Harlem restaurant Contento</a>, which distinguished itself not just for its food and wine but also for the premium it placed on physical accessibility, said there were other important ways to be welcoming to those with disabilities.</p><p>“All it takes,” he said, “is to say something like this: ‘Good evening. Please let me know if there’s anything that I can do to assist you. We are here to help you.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He added: “Just those simple words go so long and so far. And I think people forget that.”</p><p>The lawsuit and consent decree involving Katz’s, which were filed together on Dec. 17, ended the U.S. attorney’s Manhattan Restaurants A.D.A. Compliance Initiative, which was announced in September 2011.</p><p>To carry out the effort, the office said it had evaluated the A.D.A. compliance of the 50 “most popular” restaurants in the city as designated by the 2011 Zagat guide.</p><p>Many of the restaurants, Mr. Kim said, required only minor improvements to comply with the law, and the office resolved its concerns related to two dozen establishments over the next few years. Several restaurants closed before the office’s review was finished.</p><p>In about two dozen cases where more substantial improvements were necessary, the office reached voluntary compliance agreements. In two cases involving chains with several locations, the office sued to force compliance. Those matters were resolved by 2013.</p><p>Until December, Katz’s was the last holdout.</p><p>Interviewed on Tuesday, Tim and Nina Zagat were surprised, and pleased, to learn that the federal authorities had used their guidebook as part of the accessibility initiative.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>“</strong>At the end of the day,” Mr. Zagat said, “it will mean more people are able to come to Katz’s.”</p><p>The deli appears to have plenty of customers already. At midday on Tuesday, the line outside stretched down the block, as it often does. The throng of people waiting to wash down a mountain of corned beef on rye with a Dr. Brown’s soda was packed with city residents and tourists.</p><p>Lauren Peck and Nick Sauer, both 27 and visiting from Washington, D.C., waited with coffee cups in hand. They were in town for the holidays, and Ms. Peck said she was determined to show Mr. Sauer “all the institutions in New York.”</p><p>“The counter in there is like something you don’t see anywhere else,” said Ms. Peck, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University with a taste for matzo ball soup.</p><p>Mr. Sauer, who grew up in Georgia, said he had not spent much time in New York and mainly knew of Katz’s “as a pop culture reference.”</p><p>Ms. Peck had been to Katz’s twice before. Both times, she said, she had been struck by the restaurant’s tight confines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Every time I have been in there, I have thought to myself, ‘Wow, it would be extremely hard to be in here in a wheelchair,’” she said. </p><p>“It is tough with old buildings,” Mr. Sauer, an engineer who works in construction design, said, emphasizing that he had no specific knowledge about Katz’s. “You always want to make sure you do renovations without changing the character of a place.”</p><p>Ms. Peck said she thought the restaurant could probably afford to make the changes.</p><p>“It costs, like, $30 for a sandwich,” she said, her eyes wide with disbelief. </p><p>Liam Stack<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->Sheelagh McNeill<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ed-shanahan">More about Ed Shanahan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-justice-department">U.S. Justice Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/zagat-survey">Zagat Survey</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Inside New York’s Migrant Shelters: </strong>A reporter and photographer spent eight months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/nyc-migrant-shelters.html">documenting life in the city’s shelter system for migrants</a>, through the eyes of those living there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drone Fever in New Jersey: </strong>The first sighting was at a military site in New Jersey, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/nyregion/new-jersey-new-york-drones.html">then the phenomenon spread</a>.
