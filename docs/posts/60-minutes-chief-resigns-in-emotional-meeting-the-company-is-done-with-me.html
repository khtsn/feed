The correspondents Lesley Stahl and Scott Pelley were in attendance — Ms. Stahl choked up as she praised Mr. Owens, and noted that he had “taken a hell of a beating” — and Anderson Cooper dialed in from Rome, where he was covering Pope Francis’ death for CNN.</p><p>During the meeting, Mr. Owens alluded to his displeasure with additional layers of oversight that CBS executives had placed on the program. “In a million years, the corporation didn’t know what was coming up — they trusted ‘60 Minutes’ to report the stories and program the broadcast the way ‘60 Minutes’ saw fit,” he said. Any change to that arrangement, he added, created “a really slippery slope.”</p><p>Mr. Owens also discouraged his staff from quitting in protest. “I do think this will be a moment for the corporation to take a hard look at itself and its relationship with us,” he said.</p><p>Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/media/paramount-trump-cbs-news-settlement.html" title="">eager to secure</a> the Trump administration’s approval for a multibillion-dollar sale of her company to Skydance, a company run by the son of the tech billionaire Larry Ellison. She has expressed a desire to settle Mr. Trump’s case, which stems from what the president has called a deceptively edited interview in October with Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on “60 Minutes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Legal experts have dismissed that suit as baseless and far-fetched. Many journalists at CBS News — the former home of Walter Cronkite and Mike Wallace — believe that a settlement would amount to a capitulation to Mr. Trump over what they consider standard-issue gripes about editorial judgment.</p><p>A representative for Paramount declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Owens’s relationship with executives at CBS and Paramount frayed in recent months, and he has bristled at what he considered a series of intrusions into his editorial decisions, according to three people briefed on internal discussions who requested anonymity to share sensitive details.</p><p>Ms. Redstone complained to CBS executives in January about a “60 Minutes” segment on the war between Israel and Hamas, and a day later, the company appointed a veteran CBS producer, Susan Zirinsky, to a new role overseeing the news division’s journalistic standards.</p><p>In that capacity, Ms. Zirinsky reviewed “60 Minutes” segments that were deemed sensitive, including politically focused ones, before they aired, two of the people said. That kind of review is typical for many news programs, but “60 Minutes” prides itself on a long history of operating independently from the rest of CBS’s news division.</p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/bill-owens/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Owens</a> also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/business/media/john-dickerson-maurice-dubois-cbs-evening-news.html" title="">led a recent overhaul</a> of “CBS Evening News,” the news division’s flagship weeknight show, which has seen a precipitous drop in ratings since the format changes were introduced this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After Tuesday’s staff meeting, Rome Hartman, a veteran “60 Minutes” producer, called Mr. Owens’s exit “a gut punch.”</p><p>“We all find it profoundly disturbing,” Mr. Hartman said in an interview. “If the people that run Paramount and CBS think they can run ‘60 Minutes’ better than Bill Owens has run it, they’re wrong.”</p><p>Mr. Owens started at CBS as a summer intern in 1988, and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/media/60-minutes-bill-owens.html" title="">named</a> the executive producer of “60 Minutes” in 2019. In his memo on Tuesday, he pledged that the program “will continue to cover the new administration, as we will report on future administrations.” He added: “The show is too important to the country. It has to continue, just not with me as the executive producer.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has often singled out “60 Minutes” for scorn. In 2020, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/trump-lesley-stahl-60-minutes.html" title="">cut short</a> an interview with Lesley Stahl after he became displeased with her questions. He declined to be interviewed by the program during last year’s presidential campaign.</p><p>On April 13, apparently irked by that evening’s edition of the show, Mr. Trump accused “60 Minutes” of “fraudulent, beyond recognition, reporting” in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114333660655935996" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a> and urged his government regulators to strip CBS of its broadcast license. “CBS is out of control, at levels never seen before, and they should pay a big price for this,” Mr. Trump wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Executives at Paramount and at Skydance took notice of the president’s angry comments, according to three people familiar with internal discussions. Settlement talks between Paramount and Mr. Trump are ongoing, and the two sides have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/media/trump-paramount-mediator-60-minutes.html" title="">chosen a mediator</a> to help resolve the case.</p><p>Wendy McMahon, the president of CBS News and Stations, wrote in a separate note on Tuesday that she remained “committed to ‘60 Minutes’ and to ensuring that the mission and the work remain our priority.”</p><p>She also praised Mr. Owens. “Standing behind what he stood for was an easy decision for me, and I never took for granted that he did the same for me,” she wrote.</p><p>David Enrich<!-- --> and <!-- -->Lauren Hirsch<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
