The program would have cut many borrowers’ bills by as much as half.</p><p>Given its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/business/biden-student-loans-repayment.html" title="">higher costs</a>, two separate groups of Republican-led states filed legal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/13/business/biden-save-student-loans-courts.html" title="">challenges in the spring</a>, seeking to upend the program. A flurry of legal activity followed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/business/biden-student-debt.html" title="">disabling pieces</a> of the repayment plan, and a federal appeals court later granted a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/business/biden-student-loans-save-block.html" title="">request to temporarily suspend</a> the program until the lawsuits were resolved. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/supreme-court-biden-student-loans.html" title="">Supreme Court’s order</a> on Wednesday refused the Biden administration’s emergency request to lift that hold.</p><p>That keeps the eight million borrowers who are enrolled in SAVE in a state of financial uncertainty. They don’t know whether the plan’s terms will change, or if the program will survive at all. Many borrowers may find it difficult to plan a monthly budget until the legal challenges are resolved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here are some answers to questions borrowers may have.</p><h3 id="link-198c3436"><span>Does this mean I don’t currently have to make payments?</span></h3><p>Borrowers enrolled in SAVE will continue to have their payments frozen until the legal situation changes, the Education Department said on its website.</p><p>The pause began in July, after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/business/biden-student-loans-save-block.html" title="">granted a request</a> by a group of Republican-led states for an administrative stay that blocked the plan.</p><p>SAVE participants have been placed in an interest-free forbearance, which means they aren’t required to make any payments and interest will not accrue. But borrowers also won’t receive any payment credits toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">program</a>, or any of the income-driven repayment plans.</p><h3 id="link-23779ab9"><span>What if I want to continue to make payments?</span></h3><p>You can still make payments, and employers can make payments on your behalf, but those will be applied to future bills after the forbearance period ends.</p><h3 id="link-1318306c"><span>Can I still enroll in SAVE?</span></h3><p>Technically, yes. But loan servicers are holding SAVE and all other income-driven repayment plan applications for the moment. The applications essentially come in and sit on the shelf for now, said Scott Buchanan, the executive director of the <a href="https://slsa.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Student Loan Servicing Alliance</a>, an industry group. That’s because the Education Department needs to ensure that they will be processed correctly, and the legal situation remains fluid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The future of SAVE — and its terms — depends on how the legal challenges are resolved. As it stands, not all of SAVE’s benefits have been put into effect because of the court orders.</p><p>Applications for SAVE and other income-driven repayment plans are temporarily unavailable on StudentAid.gov. But borrowers can still <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-court-actions#submit-pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submit a PDF application</a> to their loan servicer by uploading it to the servicer’s website (mail or fax also works). The same applies to <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-court-actions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">loan consolidation</a> applications.</p><p>If you apply to SAVE, expect a “lengthy delay” in processing. There are no estimates on how long it may take. The Education Department suggests checking <a href="https://www.ed.gov/save" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its website</a> for updates.</p><h3 id="link-2c31687"><span>Can I apply to other income-driven repayment plans?</span></h3><p>There are limitations. In addition to SAVE, borrowers can apply to the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans#income-driven" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Income-Based Repayment</a> plan. But that program carries different terms, so you will need to be sure it makes sense for your circumstances.</p><p>Enrollments are no longer being accepted for the Pay as You Earn plan, known as <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-are-income-driven-repayment-idr-plans-and-how-do-i-qualify-en-1555/#:~:text=For%20borrowers%20who%20qualify%20for,Department%20of%20Education&#39;s%20Loan%20Simulator%20." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PAYE</a>, or the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, called I.C.R., though there are two exceptions:</p><ul><li><p>You applied to PAYE or I.C.R. before July 1 or between July 18 and Aug. 9.</p></li><li><p>Borrowers who applied for a consolidation loan that repaid a parent PLUS loan are also permitted to enroll in I.C.R. (but not PAYE).</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-5b919d31"><span>Are there any other types of forbearance?</span></h3><p>Yes, unfortunately — and that’s led to a lot of confusion. Borrowers will be placed in a “processing forbearance” for up to 60 days if a servicer needs time to process applications. Interest does accrue during that time, but qualifying payments toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-driven repayment plans also count during the period.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>If an application is not processed within that window, loans will be moved into a general forbearance in which interest does not accrue and borrowers do not receive credits toward forgiveness.</p><p>There’s more! Once an application is processed, borrowers in SAVE may be placed in the forbearance related to ongoing litigation. Loans won’t accrue interest, and payments aren’t credited toward any forgiveness programs.</p><h3 id="link-637e7577"><span>What happens next?</span></h3><p>The federal appeals court for the Eighth Circuit is considering the Biden administration’s appeal to reinstate the plan; it’s expected to act swiftly.</p><p>After the appeals court makes its ruling, either or both of the cases brought by the two groups of Republican-led states may return to the Supreme Court, according to <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/08/supreme-court-temporarily-bars-latest-biden-student-debt-relief-plan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scotusblog</a>, which is written by legal experts who analyze the highest court’s decisions.</p><p>For now, the Biden administration said it would “work to minimize further harm and disruption to borrowers as we await a final decision from the Eighth Circuit.”</p><p>Borrowers can check StudentAid.gov and the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/save" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Education Department’s website</a> for updates and more information.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tara Siegel Bernard writes about personal finance, from saving for college to paying for retirement and everything in between.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-supreme-court">U.S. Supreme Court</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
