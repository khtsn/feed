The show was a hit, its 15 works bathed in emerald tones that have become the artist’s signature. Writing in The New York Times, the art critic Roberta Smith said, “The mood in these paintings is introspective yet ever-so-slightly comedic even when things turn sinister.”</p><p>Two years later, his painting called “Four Friends” sold for nearly <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/sothebys-november-2022-contemporary-art-auctions-sales-report-warhol-1234646994/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1.6 million</a> at auction.</p><p>Then, he became nervous about overexposure and becoming another young artist whose career gets caught in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/arts/design/young-artists-auctions-collectors.html" title="">boom-and-bust economics</a> of art speculation. Toor largely retreated from the commercial side of the art world, focusing on painting in his studio and a makeshift space in Lahore when visiting family in the sun-drenched city. His color palette became more varied, including more ocean blues, acid yellows and scabby reds. His line work got looser as he became increasingly frustrated by his own conventions.</p><p>“My hand was tracing the same sort of face and the same sort of body,” Toor said. “At some point, I had to undo the exercise of copying myself. Every now and then I have to take a step back and ask what I am doing?”</p><p>Back home last summer, Toor remembered why he left Pakistan. The country still criminalizes homosexuality with potential fines and sentences ranging from two years to life imprisonment for sexual acts, though the law is not strictly enforced. And despite being a famous artist, and in a long-term relationship with the Pakistani singer Ali Sethi, he feels discouraged from expressing his identity there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-12"><div id="scrolly-instance-2"><div><div><video alt="video" id="scrolly-image-0-26" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/25/138516_1_salman-77547_wg_480p.mp4" data-credit="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video><video alt="video" id="scrolly-image-1-26" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/25/138518_1_salman-29657_wg_480p.mp4" data-credit="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video><video alt="video" id="scrolly-image-2-26" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/25/138517_1_salman-60578_wg_480p.mp4" data-credit="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><p id="scrolly-0" data-credit="">But Toor also remembered why he loves Pakistan.

He had started making classical portraits of friends that included a strange scribble of paint above their heads. That is when Catherine Redmond, his painting professor at Pratt, knew something was about to change. His brushstrokes were becoming less about the Renaissance and more about him.</p><p>“Then the green paintings came,” she said. “Green is a very difficult color to use because it automatically has red in it — its opposite on the color wheel — and it’s such a raw color. It is hard to control. So when you’re looking at one of his green paintings, you don’t even know that your brain is actually seeing red.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-14"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Sasha Arutyunova for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/04/multimedia/04cul-salman-toor-05-vjfm/04cul-salman-toor-05-vjfm-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/04/multimedia/04cul-salman-toor-05-vjfm/04cul-salman-toor-05-vjfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Sasha Arutyunova for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/04/multimedia/04cul-salman-toor-03-vjfm/04cul-salman-toor-03-vjfm-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/04/multimedia/04cul-salman-toor-03-vjfm/04cul-salman-toor-03-vjfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Sasha Arutyunova for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/04/multimedia/04cul-salman-toor-02-vjfm/04cul-salman-toor-02-vjfm-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/04/multimedia/04cul-salman-toor-02-vjfm/04cul-salman-toor-02-vjfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-3-" data-credit="Sasha Arutyunova for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/04/multimedia/04cul-salman-toor-06-vjfm/04cul-salman-toor-06-vjfm-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/04/multimedia/04cul-salman-toor-06-vjfm/04cul-salman-toor-06-vjfm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Three of Toor&#39;s paintings in the new show include &#34;Three Kissers&#34; (top left), &#34;Coral Room&#34; (top right) and &#34;Skincare&#34; (bottom left).

He missed a deadline to include a large work in the 2024 Venice Biennale and must hold back another uncompleted behemoth — a New York street scene of brownstones and hunky construction workers — from his upcoming exhibition.</p><p>“It has been hellish,” Toor said, explaining that large paintings exact a physical toll that requires painting from his elbow while balancing on ladders.</p><p>Smaller images allow him to concentrate on singular themes like belonging, memory, failure, sex and comedy. But the artist requires greater complexity in his larger paintings to plumb the entire depth of human experience — a standard of perfectionism that drives his ambition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-18"><div id="scrolly-instance-3"><div><div><video alt="video" id="scrolly-image-0-40" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/25/138515_1_salman-1137_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" data-credit="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video><video alt="video" id="scrolly-image-1-40" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/25/138514_1_salman-12878_wg_480p.mp4" data-credit="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video><video alt="video" id="scrolly-image-2-40" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/25/138513_1_salman-30886_wg_480p.mp4" data-credit="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><p id="scrolly-0" data-credit="">Toor prepares his paintings with a raw umber background before grabbing his makeshift brush, a combination of two long rods taped together with the bristles.</p><p id="scrolly-1" data-credit="">It’s a quirky setup that he borrowed from the abstract artist Brice Marden to gain some distance and a wider view.</p><p id="scrolly-2" data-credit="">He crosses his left hand over his dominant arm to provide stability, and, from memory, quickly paints a white outline as a suggestion of where he might start adding color to his figures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-73ed2214">A Newfound Confidence</h2><p>Six years ago, Toor was still transporting his paintings around New York in trash bags, waiting for the art world to take notice. Now his paintings sell in galleries between $50,000 and $300,000 or more, depending on the size.

Then I would come back a few months later and he had completely reworked it.”</p><p>Langberg continued: “He has a very specific idea of what he wants from his paintings.

One azure picture recalls Toor’s recent trip to Paris, where friends brought him to a restaurant that seemed more like a tourist trap than haute cuisine. While they laughed themselves to tears, the wait staff glared in frustration.</p><p>“It was like a fake fantasy space,” Toor said. “And they wanted us out of there. We were these three brown guys who were getting drunker and drunker.”</p><p>Toor enjoys a good laugh; his preoccupation with absurdity is manifested in the pink clown noses that appear throughout his paintings on certain male characters. “I wanted them to be sort of sad and funny and pathetic,” he said. “There’s something really sweet about them, which makes me feel like I want to help this clown.”</p><p>He relishes the clown’s tragicomic sense of timing, his ability to absorb anxieties and release them as laughter. That is part of why he rolls one of the clown’s bulbous noses down the floor in a recent paintings from his “Fag Puddle” series, which feature globule assemblages of body parts, theatrical costumes and technology melting together like wax candles in the microwave.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/892339" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier example</a> in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, on view in the contemporary art galleries, is more explicit. It features a man embracing another man’s groin as a swirl of body parts, feather boas and pearls surround them. “Heaps of fabulousness,” as the artist explained. The image serves up a jumbled expression of queer desire and failure — and the strangest part of this dreamy tableau is the smartphone painted onto its periphery, as if the scene was being recorded.</p><p>Toor explained that his own desire for security comes from the intense feelings of vulnerability growing up in Pakistan. Art history was a refuge in those times. Pictures of time-tested masters like Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens became aspirational, and tracing those images allowed Toor to feel like he was part of something greater.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>But the new paintings indicate that Toor doesn’t need the old masters.
