Soldiers could come in army fatigues. And everybody should learn 10 “meaningful” Ukrainian songs to sing around her coffin.</p><p>“Everyone will sing and learn something,” she said in her message, smiling. “In short, my funeral won’t be in vain.”</p></div></div><div><p>Her request proved to be prescient. Ms. Tsybukh was killed on May 29 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">on the front line</a> near the city of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/world/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-russia-glide-bombs.html" title="">Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine</a>, days before her 26th birthday. Her family and her battalion have chosen to withhold the details of how she died. At memorial and funeral ceremonies, thousands of Ukrainians in vyshyvankas and army uniforms sang her songs.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/12/multimedia/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/12/multimedia/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/12/multimedia/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Two people in military fatigues standing in front of others who are kneeling." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/12/multimedia/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/12/multimedia/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/12/multimedia/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/12/multimedia/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl/00ukraine-memorial-8-qgfl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Tsybukh was killed on the front line near the city of Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, days before her 26th birthday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>For Ms. Tsybukh, who also managed educational projects and was a journalist, the guidance she provided for her funeral was more than just personal preference. Yes, she wanted people to sing to relieve their sorrow over her death, but also to more fundamentally change how Ukraine remembers its fallen soldiers.</p><p>So she made it her mission. She shared her views as widely as she could — in posts and stories on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cheka_tsybukh/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, in interviews with Ukrainian news media that were published online and in her articles. In a country grappling with the enormous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/25/world/europe/ukraine-war-toll-zelensky.html" title="">toll of the war with Russia</a>, she became a leading voice on how to commemorate the country’s war dead.</p><p>Her Instagram page has around 25,000 followers, and her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cheka_tsybukh" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TikTok videos</a> regularly received tens of thousands of views. When her brother, Yurii Tsybukh, shared the news of her death on social media, he also shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7lmwlZtVsh/?g=5&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a posthumous letter</a> to her family and friends. The post has received more 100,000 likes.</p><p>Instead of centering commemorations around the grand Soviet-style memorials to the war dead that are typical in Ukraine, Ms. Tsybukh campaigned between frontline stints for what she felt was a more human approach, one that would bind the people left behind in more meaningful ways, like a daily moment of silence.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Watching a procession for Ms. Tsybukh in Lviv, Ukraine. Many people attended multiple days of farewell ceremonies for her in the city and in Kyiv.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Ukrainians needed to understand, she said, that their daily lives continued because others died protecting them.</p><p>“When we stay alive, we unwittingly become responsible to the dead, to talk and remember what happened,” Ms. Tsybukh said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZvnFxJ3SS4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview</a> with Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, just weeks before she was killed. “This is the way to be at peace with ourselves.”</p><p>A major part of that should be the government’s responsibility, she said, arguing that state institutions were ineffective at helping citizens honor soldiers and understand why they had to continue a centuries-long fight for Ukrainian independence.</p><p>Official commemorations for Ukraine’s war dead have been updated in recent years — most significantly in 2021, with a change of burial procedures, and in 2022, with plans for a National Military Memorial Cemetery. But they still center on towering granite structures built across Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union, and adorned at the time with red Soviet flags.</p></div></div><div><p>Ms. Tsybukh called the memorials impersonal and built to celebrate the power of a totalitarian state rather than the feats of its individuals, particularly Ukrainian peasants who became an expendable resource of the Soviet Army in World War II.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Ms. Tsybukh’s family, including her brother, her mother and her father, in mourning.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>And that stood in stark contrast with the values that have shaped Ukraine’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-maidan-square.html" title="">fight against Russia since 2014</a>, Ms. Tsybukh wrote in a column for Ukrainska Pravda.</p><p>Official commemorations usually involve transporting soldiers in flag-covered coffins to central squares of Ukrainian cities and cemeteries as bands play music, in a ritual that has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/world/europe/ukraine-war-lviv-funeral.html" title="">all too familiar</a> after more than two years of war.</p><p>But across the country, other ways of tribute have also sprung up — like the singing and the bonfire that honored Ms. Tsybukh. In some regions, crowds often kneel before funeral corteges, throwing flowers for deceased soldiers. Impromptu memorial services are held in many cities, with people speaking at microphones about those who died. Some brigades celebrate the lives lost with readings of patriotic verse.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Photographs of Ukrainian soldiers killed in the war with Russia displayed at a church in Lviv.

She also took issue with government initiatives like building unknown soldier monuments for those killed in the war with Russia, saying that the structures did not make sense given the realities of today’s conflict.</p><p>“We are different. We know everyone who died for Ukraine,” she said in a <a href="https://youtu.be/MfAMuxRi6Po?feature=shared" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent interview</a> on YouTube. “We will surely identify all the people. That’s why no monument for an unknown soldier can exist in the Ukrainian format.”</p><p>The National Military Memorial Cemetery is partly modeled after Arlington National Cemetery in the United States, and the first burials are expected to take place there this fall. The cemetery is set to have an unknown soldier monument whose design has yet to be decided.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Tsybukh’s coffin was placed in the soil of a military cemetery in Lviv, and people gathered around a bonfire nearby to sing and drink tea, as she had wished.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“It will have an opportunity to bury soldiers for 100 years to come — including those who will return from the war and die in old age,” said Maksym Zubov, 30, a scholar and a veteran who is in charge of figuring out of how the cemetery will memorialize the fallen soldiers taken there.</p><p>One of the main focuses of Ms. Tsybukh’s campaign was a moment of silence that was instituted by the government at the beginning of the war. The practice is sporadically observed across the country; in some places, cars and people come to a stop for a minute every morning, but in other places, like Kyiv, the capital, many people do not really pay attention to it.</p><p>Weeks before her death, Ms. Tsybukh, wearing her military uniform, gave <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sscheka/posts/3716063771942710" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a presentation</a> in Kyiv alongside other activists to press for the expansion of the practice across the country.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“When we stay alive, we unwittingly become responsible to the dead, to talk and remember what happened,” Ms. Tsybukh said in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet. “This is the way to be at peace with ourselves.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>A minute of silence held every day at 9 a.m., she said, would provide a meaningful way for Ukrainian civilians to commemorate the war dead and help them understand and process their shared traumatic history.</p></div><div><div><p>“The highest value is freedom,” she wrote in the letter that her brother posted online. “To have freedom, you need to also hold other kinds of values. You need to understand yourself, to clearly know who you are for yourself, what your personal happiness is, and how you can reach it. Once you have the answers to this question, the most important thing is to keep going.”</p><p>Thousands of people attended two days of farewell ceremonies for Ms. Tsybukh in Kyiv and Lviv.</p><p>Her coffin was placed in the soil of a military cemetery in Lviv, and people gathered around a bonfire nearby to sing and drink tea, as she had wished. Before the burial, her brother repeated his sister’s message in a clear, strong voice.</p><p>“I’ll end the way she ended her will,” he said, referring to a text message for friends posted with video instructions for her funeral: “‘Kisses. I lived, loved, fought.’”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Tsybukh’s grave in Lviv.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Drone Attack on Moscow:</strong> Russia said that it repelled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attack-moscow.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">large Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow</a>.
