</span>, the two Ascension teams have been relegated back to tier two without a chance to defend their slot.</p>

<p>The results of this week&#39;s games are as follows:</p>



<p>The final match of the week was the most anticipated, featuring a clash between Team Liquid and FNATIC for the top spot in group Omega. With two of the top three teams in the region going toe-to-toe, a close game was expected, which is what map one delivered. Liquid found a narrow overtime win on Bind, having to make a comeback from being down 9-12. Then, on FNATIC&#39;s pick of Ascent, Liquid completely wiped the floor, nearly taking a 13-0 win. In a clash of old versus new compositions, the former showed why it was the standard for so long, completely shutting down FNATIC&#39;s attack to take a 13-1 victory. With the win, Liquid have earned the first seed out of Group Omega, bringing them one step closer to Champions.</p>

</span>. As has been the story with Apeks all stage, they won one map, but couldn&#39;t keep it together enough to win a second one. KOI found their first win of the stage with <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4544/filu">
		Filu	</a>
</span> finally having a great game after what has been a rough split for him.</p>

<p>Gentle Mates also went out in similar fashion to the rest of their games. They took map one against GIANTX without much challenge, and were up 9-3 on map two of Ascent. But, in line with their reputation of losing big leads, couldn&#39;t get anything going in the second half, and GIANTX made the comeback to win in overtime. Then, the M8s fell flat on map three, and watched as their spot in VCT crumbled away. On the other hand, GIANTX secured their third win of the stage, qualifying them to playoffs for the first time since 2023.</p>

<p>With both Apeks and Gentle Mates sitting at 0-4, they are eliminated from the group stage. They are also the bottom two teams in terms of Championship points, so neither team will get the chance to defend their spot in VCT at Ascension, and next year will feature two brand new teams in EMEA.</p>

<p>Another team that secured their playoff spot this week was BBL. After a rough 0-2 start to the stage, they have bounced back with two wins in a row, with a narrow win this week over <span data-ref-id="22">
