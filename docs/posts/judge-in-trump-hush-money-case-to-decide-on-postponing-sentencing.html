    <h1>Judge in Trump Hush-Money Case to Decide on Postponing Sentencing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Thursday, Justice Merchan informed prosecutors and Mr. Trump’s lawyers that he intended to rule on Friday. The prosecutors, in turn, disclosed that timing in a separate filing in federal court, where Mr. Trump has tried but failed to move his case.</p><p>Justice Merchan has already rescheduled the sentencing once. It was originally set for July 11, but Justice Merchan pushed it back while he weighed Mr. Trump’s bid to overturn his conviction, an effort that hinges on the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision granting Mr. Trump broad immunity for official acts as president. Justice Merchan is scheduled to rule on the immunity issue on Sept. 16, just two days before sentencing, providing Mr. Trump with little runway to appeal, assuming the judge upholds the conviction.</p><p>Prosecutors at the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which brought the case, have argued that the Supreme Court’s decision has no bearing on Mr. Trump’s conviction and that it arose out of scandals unrelated to his White House duties. But they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/trump-sentencing-delay.html" title="">deferred to the judge</a> on whether to delay his sentencing past Election Day.</p><p>Mr. Trump has recently made other attempts to stave off his sentencing. Last week, he sought to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/nyregion/trump-hush-money-case.html" title="">move his Manhattan case to federal court</a>, citing the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. But the judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/nyregion/trump-hush-money-federal-court.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">rejected Mr. Trump’s argument</a> that the case involved official acts as president, a decision Mr. Trump is appealing.</p><p>“Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,” the federal judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein, wrote in his opinion.</p></div></div>
