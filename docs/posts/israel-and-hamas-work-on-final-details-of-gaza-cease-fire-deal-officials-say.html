    <h1>Israel and Hamas Work on Final Details of Gaza Cease-Fire Deal, Officials Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But in order to implement the deal, Hamas’s negotiating team in Doha must also obtain the consent of the group’s commanders in Gaza, including Mohammad Sinwar, whose brother Yahya led the group before being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-dead.html" title="">killed by Israel in October</a>. </p><p>Hamas officials did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Sinwar had responded to the proposal. </p><p>In Israel, some hard-line members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have also voiced opposition to the deal. But on Wednesday, Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, <a href="https://x.com/TheNationalNews/status/1879431395283480700" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he believed that a majority would sign off on an agreement if it came to a vote in the cabinet. </p><p>Months of shuttle diplomacy have failed to end the war in Gaza, which began after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. Around 105 captives were later released in a weeklong cease-fire in November 2023 in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. </p><p>Israel and Hamas have since held numerous rounds of indirect talks, all of which ultimately collapsed amid mutual recriminations. Officials familiar with the negotiations have expressed cautious optimism while noting that there is always a chance that the discussions will founder. </p><p>The current deal is broadly similar to a three-phase cease-fire framework publicized by President Biden in late May, according to several officials familiar with the talks. Israel and Hamas would first observe a six-week cease-fire in which Hamas would release women, older men, and ill hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinians jailed by Israel. </p><p>Under that proposal, Israel and Hamas would then declare a “permanent cessation of hostilities,” Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the remaining living hostages would be swapped for Palestinian prisoners. But the details have been a major point of contention: Hamas has demanded Israel commit to ending the war, which Israel has resisted. </p></div></div>
