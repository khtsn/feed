Scientists have said that every fraction of a degree of warming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html" title="">brings greater risks</a> from deadly heat waves, wildfires, drought, storms and species extinction.</p><p>That more stringent target looks increasingly out of reach.</p><p>Every year, Climate Action Tracker scrutinizes all the climate policies that countries have enacted worldwide, such as regulations to curb pollution from power plants or to improve the efficiency of cars. They then estimate the effect of these policies on future greenhouse gas emissions and calculate how much of a temperature increase the world can expect.</p><p>Over the past three years, the United States has enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/climate/clean-energy-us-2024-election.html" title="">is expected to pour hundreds of billions of dollars</a> into low-carbon technologies like wind, solar and nuclear energy, and carbon capture technology.

If governments followed through, warming might be limited to roughly 2.1 degrees Celsius, the report said. But many countries have not backed up those lofty promises with concrete action.</p><p>Climate Action Tracker also tried to estimate the potential effects of Donald J. Trump’s return to the White House. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/climate/trump-climate-change.html" title="">has promised</a> to slash support for clean energy and electric vehicles while dismantling environmental regulations.</p><p>The authors calculated that a complete rollback of U.S. climate policies might add as much as a few tenths of a degree of warming by 2100. The effect would be relatively limited, in part because the United States accounts for just 13 percent of global emissions today.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On the other hand, if the Trump administration’s actions led other countries to weaken or abandon their climate policies, the effect might be far greater.</p><p>The study also calculated what countries would need to do to hold total warming closer to a long-term average of 1.5 degrees Celsius, as leaders have pledged. The United States would need to slash its emissions roughly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2035. China would need to cut its emissions by two-thirds over the same time frame. India, Europe, Brazil, Japan and Australia would all have to make deeper cuts than they are currently planning.</p><p>This year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/climate/2024-temperatures-hottest-year.html" title="">Earth will already be 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than preindustrial levels</a>, at least temporarily. At the climate talks in Baku, many world leaders have been reluctant to acknowledge that the world is overwhelmingly likely to exceed that threshold in the years ahead.</p><p>But some scientists have been speaking out.</p><p>“It is always possible to find arguments to make 1.5°C forever possible, but they increasingly diverge from reality,” wrote Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo, in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/29768659241293218" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a paper published this week</a>. “It is time to admit that the world will cross 1.5°C.”</p><p>At the same time, Dr. Peters wrote, crossing that threshold “does not mean the world has failed.” Scientists have said that climate change risks increase with every fraction of a degree, so it will always be worthwhile to cut emissions as quickly as feasible to prevent further warming. But, he added, focusing on an unrealistic temperature limit “is no longer useful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Crossing 1.5°C is not a time to give up,” he wrote, “but a time to acknowledge our failures and find a new hope moving forward.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Brad Plumer is a Times reporter who covers technology and policy efforts to address global warming.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brad-plumer">More about Brad Plumer</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
