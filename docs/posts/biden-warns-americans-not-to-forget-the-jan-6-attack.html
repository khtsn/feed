    <h1>Biden Warns Americans Not to Forget the Jan. 6 Attack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was hardly the first time Mr. Biden has urged people to remember what happened on that violent day.</p><p>In 2022, a year after the Capitol assault, Mr. Biden stood in the building’s Statuary Hall to condemn the marauding mob that had tried to stop the certification of his victory. He denounced Mr. Trump’s actions as president on that day.</p><p>“At this moment,” Mr. Biden declared, “we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?”</p><p>In November, Americans delivered their answer: Three years after Mr. Biden’s speech, Mr. Trump’s return to office is set to be affirmed by Congress on Monday. Now, in his final days in office, Mr. Biden is reckoning with the reality that his repeated warnings about the threat that Mr. Trump posed to democracy went unheeded by many voters.</p><p>Until Sunday night, Mr. Biden had not repeated his warnings about the fate of democracy if Mr. Trump regained the White House. Two days after the election, the president offered a more optimistic assessment of the future. He said he had congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory and he did not repeat his concerns about what that meant for the country.</p><p>“The American experiment endures, and we’re going to be OK,” Mr. Biden said.</p><p>The following week, Mr. Biden met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office for two hours. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said the president had instructed his staff to do what Mr. Trump had refused to do four years earlier: Be gracious.</p></div></div>
