Neither did “Smash,” which was canceled after two seasons.</p><p>But “Let Me Be Your Star,” a classic “I want” song that its composer and co-lyricist, Marc Shaiman, has described as a “neck-bursting showstopper,” endures. Originally sung <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlzDTnh2ufc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at the close of the pilot</a> <strong>by Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee,</strong> the song, which was nominated for Grammy and Emmy Awards, has been <strong>covered by Andrew Rannells</strong> <a href="https://playbill.com/article/watch-andrew-rannells-sing-this-signature-smash-song-on-hbos-girls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on “Girls,”</a> by Jonathan Groff and Jeremy Jordan at MCC Theater’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM1qarweLj4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Miscast benefit</a>, <strong>by Ben Platt and Nicole Scherzinger</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L0Q4WYtqlE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in concert</a> and by masses of fans (and the occasional Muppet, on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brettevansmafrog/reel/DFq760cvQSQ/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@forlolatung/video/7277948130505526534" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq4wJQlmamw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Ostensibly a song about Monroe’s life, it resonates for any actor — and really, anyone — who longs to shine.</p><p>Now it’s been reimagined as the opening number of “Smash,” a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/theater/smash-broadway.html" title="">new Broadway musical</a> that riffs on the TV show. Hurder plays Ivy Lynn, a Broadway actress tasked with playing Marilyn in “Bombshell.” This opening version of “Let Me Be Your Star” is staged by the director Susan Stroman and the choreographer Joshua Bergasse (also a veteran of the TV “Smash”) as a Great White Way fever dream featuring elaborate harmonies, athletic dance and a brassy, big-band sound. The song recurs, in a very different style, at the end of the first act, though the producers are keeping those details secret. And it may return a third time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“It’s possible!” Stroman said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The stage version of “Smash&#34; follows the backstage meltdown of a fictional show called “Bombshell” as it approaches opening night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At that morning rehearsal, Stroman had Hurder and the ensemble run the number again. There were flips, lifts, mambo moves, thrilling vocal frills.</p><p>“Oh, wow,” Hurder fluttered when the number finished. “What a ride.” She caught her breath. “Thank you. Blessings.”</p><p>In the weeks before preview performances began (<a href="https://smashbroadway.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on March 11 at the Imperial Theater</a>), singers, members of the creative team and the show’s producers discussed how “Let Me Be Your Star” found its way to the Broadway firmament.

We gave it to Bob [Greenblatt, then the entertainment president of NBC] and he had notes.</p><p><strong>ROBERT GREENBLATT </strong>Neil [Meron] and Craig [Zadan] and Steven [Spielberg, all producers of the TV show], we all talked about it and we thought, “Is it exciting enough?” It just didn’t have that thrill. I remember thinking it needed to be like “Don’t Rain on My Parade.” It didn’t have the drive of that.

For me, coming off of “American Idol” and spending years post-“Idol” auditioning for things, it was just so symbolic. That first line, “Fade in on a girl with a hunger for fame,” me and Megan both could relate to that.

It was my idea to sing it on “Girls.” The emotion of it perfectly lines up with the vocal placement of it, so you can really just let it rip when you get to those high notes.</p><p><strong>WITTMAN </strong>People would sing it at auditions for our shows. They don’t know we wrote it.</p><p><strong>SUSAN STROMAN</strong> (the director) The first time I heard this song was on the television show. I thought it was wonderful.

For the audition, they had us sing “Let’s Be Bad” and “Let Me Be Your Star,” which is very, very difficult to sing, especially when you’re nervous. My legs were trembling. I was a basket case.</p><p><strong>GREENBLATT </strong>Robyn sang that song for us and blew the ceiling out of this room. After she walked out the door, we all were completely in agreement that she had to sing it in the show.</p><p><strong>STROMAN </strong>What’s spectacular about the song, it lends itself to different tempos, different dance arrangements. The melody lends itself to being played in many ways.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p><strong>HURDER</strong> I was elated when I found out that we were doing an up-tempo version. This is what I’ve been training for my entire life. I’m literally saying, <strong>“I’m what you’ve been needing.”</strong> It’s like life imitating art imitating life.

I get to use really all my muscles. It’s really so fun, almost over the top, so I’m just pushing, pushing, pushing, trying to make things as big and flashy and athletic and exciting as possible.</p><p><strong>STEPHEN OREMUS </strong>(the music supervisor) It’s a very specific sound, a bit like the Hollywood musicals from the ’50s and ’60s. It feels like Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall in 1961, like Nelson Riddle, a very <strong>distinct old-school vibe.</strong></p><p><strong>SHAIMAN </strong>It’s just bizarre. You don’t think of yourself as the person who wrote it anymore. It’s just there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>GREENBLATT</strong> I never get sick of it. It works every time.</p><p><strong>HURDER</strong> We<strong> </strong>recorded the number for the cast album in the beginning of January and they just sent me the final mix last week. I’m walking on 42nd Street and I’m listening to this track and I just burst into gnarly tears. Because I just I went back to 10-year-old Robyn listening to all these Broadway soundtracks. And it really, really hit me. I’m like, “You did it, Robyn.” The part where I sing, <strong>“That’s me onscreen,”</strong> it’s just Broadway dreams come true.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alexis Soloski has written for The Times since 2006.
