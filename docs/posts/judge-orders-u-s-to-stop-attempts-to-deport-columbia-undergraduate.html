    <h1>Judge Orders U.S. to Stop Attempts to Deport Columbia Undergraduate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to halt its efforts to arrest and deport a 21-year old Columbia University student who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations until the court says otherwise.</p><p>The administration has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-student-ice-suit-yunseo-chung.html" title="">seeking to arrest</a> the student, Yunseo Chung, since earlier this month, according to a lawsuit filed by Ms. Chung’s lawyers.</p><p>The judge, Naomi Buchwald, said during a hearing on Tuesday that “nothing in the record” indicated that Ms. Chung posed a danger to the community or a “foreign-policy risk” or had communicated with terrorist organizations.</p><p>Ms. Chung is a legal permanent resident. She was not a prominent participant in demonstrations on Columbia’s campus; she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/nyregion/pro-palestinian-protesters-barnard-college.html" title="">arrested along with several other students this month</a> at a protest at Barnard College, the Manhattan university’s sister school.</p></div></div>
