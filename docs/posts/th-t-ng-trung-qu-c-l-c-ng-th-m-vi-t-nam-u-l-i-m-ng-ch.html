    <h1>Thủ tướng Trung Quốc Lý Cường thăm Việt Nam: Đâu là điểm đáng chú ý?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Modern Love column debuted 20 years ago this month — on Halloween, scarily enough — with a story by a lifelong bachelor, Steve Friedman, who was trying to feel OK about being dumped. He wrote: “She dumped me. What’s important are not the details but the pronoun placement, ‘she’ preceding ‘me.’ But there is no villain here. My therapist suggests I repeat this mantra to myself. So I do. There is no villain here.”</p><p>So began my editorship of this intimate, emotional space, where every week I talk to strangers about some of the most perplexing and devastating experiences in their lives and then publish their stories for the world to read. It is an odd mix of the oh-so-private and the couldn’t-be-more-public. The effect can be validating, squirm-inducing, instructive, revelatory.</p><p>All Modern Love essays fall into one (or more) of three categories: finding love, losing love, and trying to keep love alive. Conveniently, our three most popular columns perfectly represent each of those. Even if you’re not familiar with Modern Love, there’s a good chance you’ve heard about one of them.</p><p>In the first, published way back in 2006, Amy Sutherland explored using exotic animal training techniques on her husband to try to keep their love alive in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/fashion/what-shamu-taught-me-about-a-happy-marriage.html" title="">“What Shamu Taught Me About a Happy Marriage.”</a> She overpraised her husband like a sea lion in training for putting his dirty clothes in the hamper and changed his feeding patterns in the kitchen by moving the salsa from the counter to the table, among other techniques. And it worked. Their marriage improved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 2015, Mandy Len Catron and an acquaintance asked each other 36 intimate questions to try to expedite the process of falling in love in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/style/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html" title="">“To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This.”</a> The questions — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html" title="">which you can read here</a> — start easy: “Would you like to be famous?” But they quickly go deep: “What is your most terrible memory?” “How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?” Then you’re supposed to stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes, which Mandy and her friend did. And they fell in love! After the essay was published, so did a lot of other people. We were flooded with messages from readers crediting those questions for their new relationships, marriages or deepened friendships.</p><p>A few years after that, Amy Krouse Rosenthal, who had terminal cancer and was near death, wrote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html" title="">“You May Want to Marry My Husband”</a> — an essay that served as a kind of dating profile for her husband in the hope that he would find love after she was gone. “He is a sharp dresser,” she writes, with “a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.” Amy and I edited her essay while she was in hospice, and she died 10 days after it was published.</p><p>For Modern Love’s 20th anniversary, we wanted to celebrate what has made this work so meaningful to so many. From readers, we wanted to hear whether certain stories had especially affected them. From writers, we wanted to know what had changed in their lives and how they looked back on their stories. From our longtime illustrator, Brian Rea, we wanted to know how he turns these essays into art.</p><p>People always ask what I have learned from reading some 200,000 love stories and publishing more than 1,000 of them. After all, when I started doing this work, I was a 41-year-old married father of two young children. Now, I am 61, separated for three years, and my children are long out of the house. I have lost love, found love and tried to keep love alive. And I have distilled all that reading and editing and living into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/style/modern-love-7-lessons.html" title="">seven lessons about how to love better</a>. I offer them to you.</p><h2 id="link-6196e05d">More on Modern Love’s 20th Anniversary</h2><ul><li><p>How did Modern Love begin?

Rachel Bloom worries about the scythe. A comedy about existential dread with occasional songs, Bloom’s solo-ish special arrives on Netflix after a multicity theatrical run. Inspired by the birth of her daughter and the death of her longtime collaborator Adam Schlesinger, this show finds Bloom, who created “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” attempting raunchy, absurdist bits, only to find herself increasingly distracted by thoughts of mortality. It’s a side-splitter for anyone who has tried to fake fine while staring straight into the abyss.</p><h3 id="link-63067b6e"><span><strong>RECIPE OF THE WEEK</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linda Xiao for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-5cbdc375">Quick Chicken and Dumplings</h2><p>Do you feel a slight chill in the evening air?

First, make sure you’re picking a pumpkin in peak shape: the greener the stem, the better. If you’re storing it before you carve, do so either outdoors or in the fridge — pumpkins like cool temperatures. And, lastly, when it comes to carving: Stop cutting a hole in the top! The stem is crucial to preserving a pumpkin’s structural integrity, so cut a hole in the bottom or back side instead. —<em> Rose Maura Lorre</em></p><h3 id="link-d9f2895"><span><strong>GAME OF THE WEEK</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Courtney Williams shooting the ball in Game 1 on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Wendell Cruz/USA TODAY Sports, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p><strong>Minnesota Lynx vs. New York Liberty, W.N.B.A. finals:</strong> In Game 1, the Lynx pulled off one of the most remarkable comebacks in league history.
