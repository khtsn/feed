Like a flash mob on wheels, they rode for hours in the night, by the light of streetlamps, sometimes bursting into verses of the Chinese national anthem. Some carried Chinese flags.</p><p>They were making the 40-mile journey from the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province, to the neighboring city of Kaifeng, a cycling trip that can take up to five hours one-way. Why? For the sake of it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>It isn’t clear when the craze really took off, but by early this month, it was drawing hundreds of riders seemingly every night. At first it had been celebrated online and even by the People’s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, which <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/1107/c90000-20238707.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> the night rides as “a symbol of youthful energy and the joy of shared experiences.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But over the weekend, after the number of riders swelled to the tens of thousands in a country where officials are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/asia/china-police-halloween-celebration.html" title="">increasingly wary of impromptu crowds</a>, local authorities shut it down, citing traffic and safety concerns.</p><p>The nighttime escapades started in June when four college friends in Zhengzhou decided to bike to Kaifeng to eat a type of soup dumpling that is the city’s specialty, Chinese news media has reported. Soon, hordes of college students were making the trip, too, helped by easy access to shared bicycles that are cheap and ubiquitous in many Chinese cities.<span>  </span></p><p>The students, seemingly attracted by a sense of spontaneity and adventure, posted photos and videos of their own journeys online with the caption: “Youth has no price tag.”</p><p>The buzz around the night rides drew Bin Li, a third-year engineering student at a university in Henan who boarded a train to Zhengzhou on Thursday with nothing but the clothes he was wearing.</p><p>His leap of faith paid off. Everything he needed — water, food, a bike and even companionship — materialized along the route. At the starting point, he met another college student. They set out just before midnight, and the two strangers became impromptu riding partners for the five-hour journey that followed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It didn’t feel that long because I was talking with all these strangers we met along the way,” he said. “When so many people came together to do something as one, there was a real sense of community.”</p><p>The night unfolded like a rolling street festival, with cars in adjacent lanes occasionally slowing down to blast music for the riders. Some people even set off fireworks along the route. At one point, a rider appeared with a national flag strapped to his back, spontaneously prompting the crowd to break into the national anthem, “March of the Volunteers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/11/11vid-china-biking-4667-cover/11vid-china-biking-4667-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A group of cyclists riding from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng on Thursday.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“You could hear how exhausted people were, but they were still trying their best to sing,” Mr. Li said. “With the national flag waving in front and everyone singing the anthem behind it, there was this really powerful energy, truly incredible.”</p><p>Mr. Li arrived in Kaifeng around 4 a.m. on Friday and followed the crowd to a Song dynasty theme park. The bike Mr. Li rented for the journey cost him 26 yuan, or about $4.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At first, officials had encouraged the craze, which was seen as good for business and tourism. The theme park in Kaifeng, along with many other popular tourist attractions, changed their schedules to open early and offered free admissions to students. Volunteers distributed free breakfast at the gate.</p><p>The city also set up additional bike docking sites, and traffic police were dispatched to escort the students on their journeys. Many students would spend a day or two in Kaifeng, then take the train back, state media has reported.</p><p>But the welcome quickly turned into criticism.</p><p>On Friday night, photos and videos showed bikes filling up a multilane road between the two cities, with cars squeezed to the sides and the crowd stretching for miles. By then, the trend had spread beyond college students, drawing participants of all ages from cities across the country.</p><p>Among them was Fen Shen, a 32-year-old construction contractor in Zhengzhou. Watching the youthful energy sweep through his city, he felt an urge to help even if he did not want to bike himself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“I felt inspired by the atmosphere,” Mr. Shen said. “It’s just so good to be young — there’s no pressure, you can just pick up and go whenever you feel like it.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/10/world/10xp-biking/10xp-biking-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/10/world/10xp-biking/10xp-biking-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/10/world/10xp-biking/10xp-biking-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="People on bikes took up most of the lanes on the road between the two cities." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/10/world/10xp-biking/10xp-biking-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/10/world/10xp-biking/10xp-biking-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/10/world/10xp-biking/10xp-biking-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/10/world/10xp-biking/10xp-biking-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f24991ff-3c4a-5f48-b709-3462dae67353" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The crowd of bikers often stretched for miles.

But his participation was short-lived. By Friday night, many would-be riders gave up after finding that rental bikes were already taken.<br/></p><p>The next day, both cities <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8yqvGMqxO1753ksuIRHbbQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that on Saturday night, they would close the lanes for nonmotorized vehicles — that is, bikes — on the road the students had been using. Some bike rental companies that operate in Zhengzhou announced that their bikes would lock if residents attempted to take them out a designated zone within the city.</p><p>When Mr. Shen went to the usual starting point on Saturday, the scene had changed. Police officers and security guards were stationed at several intersections, blocking access to the highway, he said.</p><p>“While the youth were carousing, more and more people were beginning to worry about the hidden dangers of the large gathering of bikes,” the Kaifeng Public Security Bureau said in a social media <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/okF9cznm9Kjq3edg08tm9A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>What if an ambulance needed to use the road but couldn’t get through, the post asked, or what if a bicyclist in the crowd fell but was unable to escape the congestion?</p><p>“You don’t need to bike in a large group or late at night,” the bureau added. “Why not set off during the day?”</p><p>The change in tone reflects the delicate balance Chinese authorities face when managing spontaneous youth movements, said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago who studies Chinese politics.</p><p>On one hand, officials saw the students’ enthusiasm as a way to drive broader excitement about a smaller city like Kaifeng. But they may have underestimated the pent-up energy of young people, Mr. Yang said, including students from other parts of the country, at a time when many are still carrying the emotional weight of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/world/asia/china-zero-covid-policy-videos.html" title="">pandemic</a>, when college campuses were locked down.</p><p>“Instead of trying to find a way to channel the students’ energy, the stability-obsessed authorities simply decided the easiest way is to limit their access and mobility,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Li, the engineering student, said his university is now warning students not to join the night rides. </p><p>“These are the only years in my life where I don’t have to worry about other things, so I have to make memories that will last,” he said. “Once I start working, there will no longer be a chance to do this.”</p><p>On Chinese social media, people posted messages saying that their universities in Henan were restricting students from leaving campus without permission, but the measures could not immediately be verified.</p><p>Some also posted messages and videos saying that the restrictions would not stop them — instead of riding, they would simply walk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The students rode from the city of Zhengzhou, in Henan Province, to the neighboring city of Kaifeng.
