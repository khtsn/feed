Hochman, who was elected on promises to take a harder line on crime, had argued against a lighter sentence. Judge Jesic had already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/arts/menendez-brothers-resentencing.html" title="">rejected multiple requests by Mr. Hochman to withdraw a resentencing petition</a> put forward by Mr. Hochman’s predecessor.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The resentencing effort and clemency petition are the primary legal pathways that could lead to the brothers’ freedom.</p><p>It was more than 35 years ago that Lyle and Erik Menendez — then 21 and 18 — walked into the den of their Beverly Hills mansion and fired more than a dozen shotgun rounds at their parents, killing them both.</p><p>In recent years, Lyle, now 57, and Erik, now 54, have been thrust back into the media spotlight thanks to the revelation of new evidence, an army of social media defenders and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/arts/television/menendez-brothers-netflix-monsters.html" title="">recent TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/arts/television/menendez-brothers-netflix-takeaways.html" title="">documentary</a> examining the crime and their trials. All of that has led to the hearings this week.</p><p>Here’s what else to know about the case.</p><h2 id="link-e74e35d">There were three legal paths being pursued that could have freed the brothers.</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/menendez-brothers-prison-sentence.html" title="">resentencing track</a> was initiated by the former Los Angeles County district attorney, George Gascón, last fall. Separately, the court initiated its own resentencing petition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The second path was the clemency petition on the desk of Mr. Newsom, who indicated that he supported re-examining the case. The governor had ordered the state’s parole board to assess whether the brothers would pose a threat to public safety if released.</p><p>The parole board hearing on the clemency petition is scheduled for June 13. It is not yet clear, with Judge Jesic’s decision on Tuesday, whether the board will consider the brothers’ suitability for parole at the same time.</p><p>The third path was a habeas corpus petition filed by the brothers’ lawyers, who claimed that newly unearthed evidence of sexual abuse by Jose Menendez, Lyle and Erik’s father, would have altered the outcome of their trial if it had been available at the time. This was considered the least likely path, and Mr. Hochman, the current district attorney, announced in February that he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/menendez-brothers-nathan-hochman-conviction.html" title="">opposed to a new trial</a>.</p><h2 id="link-34b0b09f">The new district attorney did not support resentencing.</h2><p>Often, resentencing hearings are not adversarial proceedings because the district attorney’s office has already voiced its support.</p><p>In this case, the prosecutors had argued against resentencing the brothers, even though the office, under the previous district attorney, had initiated the process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In October, Mr. Gascón, when he was still district attorney, asked a judge to resentence the Menendez brothers to a term that would make them eligible for parole.</p><p>While acknowledging that the brothers had committed “horrible acts,” Mr. Gascón said he believed they had engaged in “a journey of redemption and a journey of rehabilitation” while incarcerated. A lawyer for the brothers recently said their rehabilitation had been “exemplary” and highlighted that they had created programs, counseled and mentored others and pursued higher education behind bars.</p><p>On April 9, the new district attorney, Mr. Hochman said that prosecutors were prepared to proceed with the court-initiated hearings on resentencing, but his office was asking that Mr. Gascón’s motion be withdrawn. That request was rejected by Judge Jesic.</p><p>The brothers had also petitioned the governor to grant them clemency, a bid that Mr. Gascón supported. Mr. Hochman, in his public statements, has stressed that the governor could grant clemency at any time, regardless of what happens with resentencing.</p><p>As the brothers made their case to be released, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/lyle-erik-menendez-parole-prison-good-behavior.html" title="">portrait of their time in prison</a> emerged of siblings who came to be regarded as model inmates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But Mr. Hochman, a former federal prosecutor, and his team have argued repeatedly that the brothers have not demonstrated that they have “full insight” into their crimes. The brothers, they argue, never renounced their claim that they killed their parents because they feared their parents would kill them first, which prosecutors maintain was a lie.</p><h2 id="link-2d76b694">What were the brothers convicted of?</h2><p>In 1996, the Menendez brothers were found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/21/us/menendez-brothers-guilty-of-killing-their-parents.html" title="">guilty of first-degree murder</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/us/menendez-brothers-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.html" title="">sentenced to life in prison without parole</a> for killing their parents, Jose, a music executive, and Mary Louise, a former beauty queen who went by Kitty.</p><p>It was their second trial. Two years earlier, a mistrial was declared after two separate juries (one for each brother) deadlocked over a verdict.</p><p>The trials proceeded quite differently.</p><p>In the first, defense lawyers claimed that the brothers had killed their parents after years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse by their father and that they feared for their lives. Their mother, they said, knew about the abuse but didn’t stop it.</p><p>Interviews with jurors after the mistrial revealed that some of them questioned how serious the abuse had been and to what extent it justified their actions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In the second trial, which led to their convictions and in which the brothers were tried in front of a single jury, lawyers for the brothers were limited in what evidence could be presented.</p><p>The judge, Stanley M. Weisberg, prohibited their lawyers from using the “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-18-mn-55958-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abuse excuse</a>,” essentially leaving only two options for jurors: an acquittal or a murder conviction. They went with the latter.</p><h2 id="link-3704c5aa">New evidence has emerged in recent years.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Erik Menendez, left, in 2016, and Lyle Menendez in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Last year, Roy Rosselló, a former member of the boy band Menudo, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/arts/television/menendez-brothers-menudo-roy-rossello-documentary.html" title="">publicly revealed</a> in the Peacock documentary “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed” that Jose Menendez had sexually assaulted him at the Menendez family home in New Jersey when he was 14.</p><p>The journalist Robert Rand, who had written extensively about the brothers in his book “The Menendez Murders,” also brought forward a letter that Erik wrote when he was 17 to his cousin, detailing his father’s sexual abuse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In the news conference in October, Mr. Gascón said he believed the brothers’ molestation claims.</p><h2 id="link-141fb48a">Where does the family stand?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joan Andersen VanderMolen, the sister of Kitty Menendez, at a news conference.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Earlier this year, two dozen family members called for the brothers’ resentencing in a letter submitted to the court, arguing that “continued incarceration serves no rehabilitative purpose.” They have held several news conferences and other events to rally support for the brothers in the time since.</p><p>Not everyone in their family agreed.
