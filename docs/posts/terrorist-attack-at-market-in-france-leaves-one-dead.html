The Arabic phrase, meaning “God is great,” is an everyday expression used in religious and nonreligious settings alike, but has also become a war cry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/world/americas/allahu-akbar-terrorism.html" title="">in some terrorist attacks</a> by Islamic fundamentalists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A civilian who tried to stop the man was killed, the police said.
