The government also said the university had misidentified many of the foreign sources without providing additional details.</p><p>Consequently, the department said it is demanding the college produce a lengthy and detailed list of documents within 30 days. Those documents include copies of admissions agreements with foreign governments for international students, as well as records related to faculty and research collaborations from the past eight years. The government is also seeking the names and contact information for university personnel involved in the “creation, administration or management” of those agreements.</p><p>In addition, the department asked for the names and contact information of college personnel involved in exchange student visitor programs and anyone involved in international research collaborations.</p><p>A spokesman for Penn did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>The investigation into Penn’s foreign funding is at least the third such inquiry started by the agency in the past three weeks.
