    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbaya had been generally considered a safe area, where people fleeing the fighting in nearby southern Lebanese towns had taken shelter. </p><p>Reporters Without Borders, the international advocacy group, said <a href="https://rsf.org/en/war-lebanon-journalists-must-be-protected-and-allowed-work-freely" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement this month</a> said journalists in Lebanon had narrowly escaped Israeli strikes or had been forced to flee their homes, and that journalists in the country should be allowed to report on the expanding war there without danger or harassment.</p><p>Earlier this week, Al-Mayadeen said that one of its offices in Beirut had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-southern-lebanon.html?ogrp=ctr&amp;smid=url-share" title="">hit by an Israeli military strike</a>. Israel said it had targeted civilian buildings used by Hezbollah to manufacture or store weapons. The offices were unoccupied, having been vacated at the start of Israel’s invasion, the network said, and there were no reports of injuries.</p><p>On Wednesday, Israel’s military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/middleeast/al-jazeera-journalists-hamas-pij.html" title="">accused six Al Jazeera reporters based in Gaza</a> of being fighters for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera strongly denied the accusations, which it said were based on “fabricated evidence” and followed a long history of Israeli hostility toward the network.</p><p>Israel has repeatedly accused the Qatar-based broadcaster of being a threat to its national security, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/world/middleeast/al-jazeera-west-bank-raid.html" title="">raiding its offices</a> in the West Bank and accusing it of being “used to incite terror.”</p></div></div>
