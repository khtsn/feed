Three other people were wounded in the strike, the ministry said.</p><p>The Al-Manar network, operated by the militant group Hezbollah, reported that a cameraman working for the broadcaster was killed. Al Mayadeen, an outlet widely seen as aligned with Hezbollah, said a cameraman and a broadcast engineer with the network were among the dead.</p><p>Israel’s military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike.</p><p>Eighteen journalists from seven news organizations were at the site of the strike, Lebanon’s minister of information, <a href="https://x.com/ZiadMakary/status/1849695393061196287" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ziad Makary</a>, said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hasbaya had been generally considered a safe area, where people fleeing the fighting in nearby southern Lebanese towns had taken shelter.</p><p>Reporters Without Borders, the international advocacy group, said <a href="https://rsf.org/en/war-lebanon-journalists-must-be-protected-and-allowed-work-freely" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement this month</a> said journalists in Lebanon had narrowly escaped Israeli strikes or had been forced to flee their homes, and that journalists in the country should be allowed to report on the expanding war there without danger or harassment.</p><p>Earlier this week, Al-Mayadeen said that one of its offices in Beirut had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-southern-lebanon.html?ogrp=ctr&amp;smid=url-share" title="">hit by an Israeli military strike</a>. Israel said it had targeted civilian buildings used by Hezbollah to manufacture or store weapons.
