It is unclear whether Russia will be able to retain the military bases it has on Syria’s Mediterranean coast.</p><p>Initially, Turkey did not say much when the rebels swept across northern Syria, seizing two important cities in a few days. But when Mr. Erdogan finally did speak, he was quietly confident.</p><p>“The target is of course Damascus,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-hopes-syrian-rebels-will-advance-raises-alarm-about-some-2024-12-06/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said last Friday.</a> “Our hope is for this march in Syria to proceed without incidents.”</p><p>Two days later, the rebels delivered a personal vindication for Mr. Erdogan by storming into Damascus and taking control. Within a few days, Turkey was making plans to reopen its embassy, which has been closed for almost 13 years, and a senior Turkish official, Ibrahim Kalin, the head of the national intelligence agency, was seen in the Syrian capital in footage showed on Turkish television.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Thursday, Turkey assigned a temporary chargé d’affaires to Damascus, a Turkish official said, asking for anonymity under diplomatic protocol. Appointing a chargé d’affairs rather than an ambassador is a way for Turkey to keep diplomatic channels open without getting into the debate of whether it is recognizing the largest rebel force, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, which led the offensive and has already set up a transitional government in Damascus. Turkey has considered the group a terrorist organization since 2018.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Bashar al-Assad in Istanbul in 2010.

Early in the Turkish leader’s presidency, 20 years ago, Mr. Erdogan cultivated closer ties with Syria. It paid off then, and Mr. al-Assad made a historic trip <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2004/1/6/al-asad-in-landmark-visit-to-turkey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to Ankara, the Turkish capital, in 2004</a>, the first visit there by a Syrian president.</p><p>Trade flourished in the aftermath, with visa-free travel between Syria and Turkey, and the two presidents became firm friends. Mr. Erdogan and his wife even hosted the Syrian first couple for a vacation on the Turkish coast. Relations blossomed, and so did economic benefits for both countries.</p><p>The relationship turned sour with the Arab Spring protests of 2011. Mr. al-Assad chose to impose harsh repression against Mr. Erdogan’s advice, a former Turkish presidential aide said. Affronted, the Turkish leader helped arm part of the opposition over the course of Syria’s civil war, and excoriated his Syrian counterpart in speeches.</p><p>He took in more than three million Syrian refugees and committed Turkish troops to secure a buffer zone inside Syria for millions more displaced people who took refuge there. And he funded and trained a Turkish-backed rebel force, the Syrian National Army, which provided security for Turkish military bases in northern Syria and helped Ankara fight Kurdish forces that Turkey viewed as a threat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrians in Gaziantep, Turkey, waving opposition flags on Sunday while celebrating Mr. al-Assad’s fall.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Turkey also became the main interlocutor with H.T.S. The group is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-terrorist-designation.html" title="">designated a terrorist organization</a> by Turkey, the United States and European nations because of its history of Islamist extremism, but the Turks found a way to work with them and now have enormous leverage through that connection.</p><p>“Out of all the region’s major players, Ankara has the strongest channels of communication and history of working with the Islamist group now in charge in Damascus, positioning it to reap the benefits of the Assad regime’s demise,” Gonul Tol, the director of the Middle East Institute’s Turkish program, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/turkey/how-turkey-won-syrian-civil-war" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine</a> on Thursday.</p><p>Turkey has provided indirect assistance to the group, Ms. Tol wrote, by shielding it from Syrian government attacks through the presence of Turkish troops in Idlib Province. It also channeled humanitarian aid and trade into the region, which helped H.T.S. gain legitimacy among the people of the region. “All this has given Turkey influence over H.T.S.,” she wrote.</p><p>A Syrian rebel commander, interviewed on Friday, said the rebels had set up a joint command to coordinate rebel group operations. Turkey was aware of the planning of the offensive and ongoing operations, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Aydintasbas, who is in touch with Turkish officials in Ankara, said she believed Ankara would have given at least tacit approval for the offensive. “They never thought it would be widely successful,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Aydintasbas also credited Turkey, along with international aid organizations working in northwestern Syria, with pushing H.T.S., a former Qaeda affiliate, to moderate its extremism.</p><p>Turkey’s mentoring of the group could be seen in the early statements of the H.T.S. leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-leader-interview.html" title="">Ahmed al-Shara, who used the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani</a>, as he reassured Syria’s minorities that there would be no repression and ordered restraint from his soldiers.</p><p>“There has been a lot of hand-holding,” Ms. Aydintasbas said of Turkey’s relationship with the group.</p><p>Turkey has also started to raise its voice internationally on behalf of Syria. In a statement, Turkey’s foreign ministry voiced strong support for Syria’s sovereignty, political unity and territorial integrity, and condemned Israel for breaking a longstanding disengagement agreement by “entering the Israel-Syria zone and its continuing advance into Syrian territory.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>(Since Mr. al-Assad’s ouster on Sunday, Israe<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">l has conducted hundreds of aerial strikes</a> on military targets in Syria.)</p><p>Turkey has been conducting its own military operations, including airstrikes, in northern Syria against Kurdish militants whom it considers a terrorist threat to Turkey. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces inspecting a destroyed truck after a Turkish airstrike near Qamishli, northeast of Syria, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmed Mardnli/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>One of Turkey’s most powerful politicians has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/middleeast/turkey-terrorist-attack-kurdish-peace-talks.html" title="">floated an offer</a> to release the long-imprisoned Kurdish militant leader, Abdallah Ocalan, if he agrees to renounce militancy and disband his armed movement, a gesture that suggested a new openness in the Turkish government to the possibility of revived peace talks between the longtime adversaries.</p><p>Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, has urged swift international assistance for Syria. “Syria has reached a stage where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country,” he said after a meeting in Doha, Qatar, among Turkey, Russia and Iran, Mr. al-Assad’s other main backer. “Today, there is hope. The Syrian people cannot achieve this alone. The international community must support the Syrian people.”</p><p>Ms. Aydintasbas said the primary concern of Turkey and H.T.S. was “to prevent an utter state collapse, and so they have been doing all the right things, trying to preserve institutions and even the bureaucracy inside institutions, even ministries.”</p><p>Safak Timur<!-- --> contributed reporting from Istanbul, and <!-- -->Ruhullah Khapalwak<!-- --> from Vancouver, Canada.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Syria’s Civil War: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Who Set the Stage for Bashar al-Assad’s Ouster?:</strong> President Biden says he weakened Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/al-assad-ouster-us-israel.html">laying the groundwork for the Syrian president’s fall</a>.
