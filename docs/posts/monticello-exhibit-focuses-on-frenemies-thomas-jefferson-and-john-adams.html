After a decade of escalating tensions between Britain and the colonists, a shooting war had broken out in Massachusetts. The Continental Congress formed an army, appointing an upstanding Virginian, George Washington, to lead it.</p><p>“Which, by the way,” the guide noted wryly, “was John Adams’s idea.”</p><p>Virginia may be a purple state these days, but the area around Monticello is still rock-ribbed Jefferson country. Heading south, you can follow Thomas Jefferson Parkway to Jefferson Vineyards. Go a few miles north, to downtown Charlottesville, and you hit “Mr. Jefferson’s university,” as some still reverentially call it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But as the 250th anniversary of American independence approaches, his fellow founder and sometime nemesis is getting prominent billing up at Monticello, thanks to “Founding Friends, Founding Foes,” a new tour built around the fraught 50-year relationship between Jefferson and Adams.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A vegetable garden to the left of a dirt pathway, with hills in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/25/multimedia/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv/25cul-monticello-tour-gmcv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/06c219f7-653b-5821-aa1c-1e42d9c2dc45" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Monticello, where Thomas Jefferson retired after leaving the White House in 1809, the house and surrounding fields and gardens have been restored to look as they did when he lived there.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The tour uses spaces in the magnificent house Jefferson designed, and items he kept close to him, to unpack their lifelong frenemyship. That often-fractious relationship stretched from their collaboration on the Declaration of Independence to Jefferson’s defeat of Adams in the 1800 presidential election to their deaths, hours apart, on July 4, 1826.</p><p>The tour explores the vicious partisan politics of the 1790s, and the rise of the two-party system we know (and may love or hate) today. And it invites guests to reflect on parallels with today’s toxic politics and hyperpolarization, whether on the drive home or during special dinner table civic conversations — or as Jefferson would have put it, <a href="https://www.monticello.org/research-education/for-educators/feast-of-reason/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“feasts of reason”</a> — held on the grounds after some tours.</p><p>These days, the Mountaintop, as Jefferson called the upper reaches of his 5,000-acre estate, is in exquisite condition, thanks to a <a href="https://monticello-www.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/files/pdfs/archived-pages/blog/2014-01-14_introducing-the-mountaintop-project-revealing-jefferson-s-monticello.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multiyear effort</a> to restore its buildings, gardens and fields to the way they looked in his retirement years.

That started to shift in the early 1990s, when the foundation created its first tour focused on slavery, even as some accused it of continuing to downplay the darker side of Jefferson’s story.</p><p>But things changed drastically after 2000, when the foundation announced, in the wake of DNA research and scholarship by historians led by <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/annette-gordon-reed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Annette Gordon-Reed</a>, that it had <a href="https://www.monticello.org/thomas-jefferson/jefferson-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-a-brief-account/monticello-affirms-thomas-jefferson-fathered-children-with-sally-hemings/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accepted</a> longstanding claims that Jefferson had fathered six children with Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Today, Monticello is seen as a leader among historical houses grappling with slavery.

And it offers various <a href="https://www.monticello.org/visit/tickets-tours/from-slavery-to-freedom/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in-depth tours</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/sally-hemings-exhibit-monticello.html" title="">exhibits</a> dedicated to slavery, a subject that is also woven into every tour, including “Founding Friends, Founding Foes.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jane Kamensky, the president of Monticello, said that the house is a rare place that draws people of all political stripes. “What shows up in the country shows up at the gates,” she said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At Monticello, the new tour is described not as a pivot, but a continuation of its commitment to difficult conversations — and to meeting its diverse stakeholders where they are.</p><p>Jane Kamensky, a historian of the American Revolution who left Harvard last year to become president of Monticello, said the new tour grew out of research showing that many visitors wanted more political history, and more about Jefferson’s career. It also reflects her conviction that Monticello can be a “civic engine” for thinking about our current divides — and modeling how, as she puts it, to disagree better.</p><p>“On the tour, you hopefully feel a sense of inspiration around the possibility of this political friendship recovering itself, this civic friendship recovering itself,” Kamensky said. “And then maybe you’re inspired to call your uncle who you fell out with over Thanksgiving because you supported Trump and he supported Harris.”</p><p>That might sound like 18th-century pie in the sky thinking, even without the ratcheting tensions of the second Trump administration. In a much-noted 2019 paper on partisanship, two political scientists reported survey data showing that 16 percent of Republicans and 20 percent of Democrats had sometimes thought the country would be better off if large numbers of people from the other side <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/opinion/hate-politics.html" title="">“just died.”</a></p><p>But for Kamensky, the fact that Jefferson himself is a lightning rod, who draws <a href="https://jeffersoncouncil.org/events/in-defense-of-thomas-jefferson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defenders</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/books/henry-wienceks-master-of-the-mountain-irks-historians.html" title="">haters</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/books/thomas-jefferson-neither-god-nor-devil.html" title="">everything in between</a>, gives Monticello an advantage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“I don’t envy the president of the Lincoln presidential library,” she said. “Everyone knows how they feel about Lincoln and feels affirmed in their admiration of him.

And even on normal days, he added, it was important not to pass judgment on visitors based on hats, clothing or other cues. “You can’t assume people feel a certain way,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Holly Haliniewski, a guide here for nearly seven years, said that in the intense months since President Trump returned to office, Monticello had been a tonic.</p><p>“It’s been so good to come to work here, rather than sitting at home in my silo,” she said. “This is one of the last places where people do come together, which makes me hopeful.”</p><h2 id="link-230eb37e">Bridging the Divide</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After decades of minimizing slavery, Monticello has become a leader in grappling with the subject, adding tours and exhibits, like one in the south wing, above, dedicated to Sally Hemings.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Guides at Monticello are familiar with emotional, and sometimes hostile, visitor reactions, particular around slavery. Still, at a recent all-day training session, some guides expressed nervousness about inviting a conversation about 2025 politics, even on a tour whose overt content stays firmly in the past.</p><p>Brandon Dillard, Monticello’s director of historic interpretation and audience engagement, offered reassurance. “All of you are excellent at talking about racism and the legacy of slavery in America,” he said. “I think you can handle a conversation about partisanship.”</p><p>Each of the roughly four dozen guides at Monticello writes their own tour, within set parameters. Earlier this year, as part of the training for “Founding Friends, Founding Foes,” Monticello organized daylong sessions with historians and political scientists. On this day in late February, the speakers were leaders from BridgeUSA and Living Room Conversations, two of the <a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/listen-first-coalition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of “bridging” organizations</a> that have sprung up in recent years on campuses and in communities, with the mission of promoting civil disagreement and dialogue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Becca Kearl, the executive director of <a href="https://livingroomconversations.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Living Room Conversations</a>, which was founded in 2010, began by asking everyone to pull out their smartphones and, using a QR code, contribute to a word cloud, using the prompt “America is….”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guides at Monticello are familiar with emotional, and sometimes hostile, visitor reactions, particular around slavery.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The screen at the front of the room started to fill with responses like “under attack,” “not a democracy,” “complicated” “an oligarchy,” “Trump,” and “a mess.” But there was also “an inspiration” and “my home.”</p><p>Kearl ran through some discouraging statistics about polarization. But like many in the “bridging” world, she prefers to emphasize <a href="https://www.moreincommon.com/media/y4rpsigy/defusing-the-history-wars_more-in-common-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent research</a> showing that a large majority of people across the political spectrum want honest, fact-based history that honors shared American values without glossing over hard things.</p><p>“We feel divided, but a lot of that is coming from the top down,” she said. “I’m not saying things aren’t happening now that are really divisive. But research shows we really want to be united.”</p><p>What that means on the ground is complicated. One guide asked whether the civic dialogue approach downplays the degree to which people from minority groups may feel less empowered to speak, if they are present at all. (Monticello’s visitors, according to its data, skew heavily white, as they do at museum sites as a whole.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Another noted the challenge of navigating the political gap between, say, Charlottesville, which voted 84 percent Democratic in the 2024 presidential election, and Greene County, a heavily rural Republican stronghold only about 20 miles away.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-27"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The tour is cued to objects like an engraving of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Items in Jefferson’s bedchamber, where he died on July 4, 1826, five hours before Adams.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Kearl, describing herself as a registered Republican who feels conservative in a national context but “super-liberal in Utah,” where she lives, said that political identity can be complicated.

And by their 1800 rematch, the brutal politics of the “factions” that many of the founders had warned against produced what is still seen as <a href="https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/election-1800/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the nastiest, most bitterly partisan elections in American history</a>.</p><p>Adams’s Federalists accused Jefferson of being an anarchist, an atheist, a traitor and a French spy. Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans, meanwhile, denounced Adams as a warmonger, a monarchist and a tyrant. And then — as fans of “Hamilton” will remember — the election was thrown into the House of Representatives, where it took more than 30 ballots for Jefferson to prevail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>Adams left office in 1801, in the first peaceful transfer of power to a political opponent in American history. But the two men did not exchange a single word for more than a decade.</p><p>Then, in January 1812, three years after Jefferson had retired to Monticello, a courier — “probably an enslaved person,” Falcone said — arrived with something unexpected: a letter from Adams.</p><p>The <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-5735" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brief letter</a> included New Year’s wishes, and a book written by his son John Quincy Adams, who Jefferson had known as a child. The missives started flying back and forth, and didn’t stop.</p><p>“You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other,” Adams <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-06-02-0247" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> to Jefferson in July 1813. But explaining themselves, Falcone noted, did not mean changing the other’s mind.</p><p>The tour — with its discussions of the partisan press, the deportation of “enemy aliens,” debates over executive power and racist rumor campaigns — offered plenty of rhymes with our political present, without overtly spelling them out, or telling anyone what to think. Visitors are left to decide what message, if any, they will carry back down from the mountaintop to the messy country below.</p><p>But Falcone ended the tour with a hopeful line from Jefferson: “I like the dreams of the future rather than the history of the past.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-41"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jennifer Schuessler is a reporter for the Culture section of The Times who covers intellectual life and the world of ideas.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>AR</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>American Politics, From Square One<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Jenner &amp; Block: </strong>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-jenner-block-law-firm.html">struck down an executive order</a> that threatened penalties against the law firm, which once employed a top attorney who helped investigate the president alongside the team run by Robert Mueller, who was then the special counsel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restricting Covid Shots: </strong>The Food and Drug Administration announced that it was likely to limit access to Covid vaccines among healthy children and adults this fall. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/health/covid-vaccine-restrictions-eligibility.html">Here’s what experts expect if the plan goes forward</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greenhouse Gas Limits on Power Plants: </strong>The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/climate/epa-power-plant-rules.html">eliminate all limits</a> on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The Times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Crypto Dinner:</strong> The Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to identify who was invited to President Trump’s private event for customers of his cryptocurrency business and a White House tour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-crypto-dinner-attendees.html">Here are some of them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build-Out of Nuclear Power Plants:</strong> President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/climate/trump-executive-order-nuclear-power.html">accelerating the construction of the plants</a>, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors that offer the promise of faster deployment but have yet to be proven.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ignoring Economic Warning Signs: </strong>The president’s economic policy approach is so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-taxes-tariffs-economy.html">rattling markets, businesses and consumers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>MAHA Report: </strong>The G.O.P. chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were “troubled” by the Make America Healthy Again Commission’s findings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republican-agriculture-pesticides-kennedy-maha-report.html">urged it to use sounder science</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Rare Check on Trump’s Actions: </strong>President Trump has suffered a string of court losses, as federal judges ruled that his administration broke the law on a number of matters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-courts-judges-law.html">But judicial orders to unwind his actions can be easier said than done</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
