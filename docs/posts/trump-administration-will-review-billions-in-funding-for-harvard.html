    <h1>Trump Administration Will Review Billions in Funding for Harvard</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Alan M. Garber, Harvard’s president, was not immediately available for comment. But he has previously emphasized the importance of federal money to the university’s operation.</p><p>“We could not carry out our mission the way we do now without substantial federal research support, nor could we provide the benefits to the nation that we do now without that support,” Dr. Garber said in a <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/12/13/garber-defends-trump-bhattacharya-nih/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">December interview</a> with The Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper.</p><p>The threatened action against Harvard followed a decision, made public on March 7, to cut about $400 million in funding for Columbia “due to the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” Desperate to restart the funding, Columbia agreed two weeks later to comply with preconditions demanded by the administration, a step toward regaining the money.</p><p>In February, Harvard was placed on a list of 10 universities, including Columbia, under scrutiny by an antisemitism task force formed by the Trump administration, which said it planned to visit the schools.</p><p><em>This is a developing story. Check back for updates.</em></p></div></div>
