Trump. Then, beginning on the night of Nov. 5, he spent basically no time without him.</p><p>And so Mr. Musk, more than any other key player in the presidential transition, finds himself in a cram session to learn the courtier politics of Mr. Trump’s inner circle. For the world’s richest person — not known for his humility or patience — it is a social engineering challenge far trickier and less familiar than heavy manufacturing or rocket science.</p><p>Doubts abound as to whether he will graduate in 2028 with a four-year degree in Trumpism: It is now a parlor game in Washington and Silicon Valley to speculate just how long the Musk-Trump relationship will last. The answer, as discarded aides from Mr. Trump’s first term will tell you, may depend on Mr. Musk’s ability to placate the boss and keep a relatively low profile — but also to shiv a rival when the time comes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In short, how to play the politics of Trumpworld.</p><p>Most of the people who now surround Mr. Trump in the transition are battle-tested aides from his past fights, or decades-long personal friends. Mr. Musk is neither. What he brings instead are his 200 million followers on X and the roughly $200 million he spent to help elect Mr. Trump. Both of those have greatly impressed the president-elect. Mr. Trump, gobsmacked by Mr. Musk’s willingness to lay off <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">80 percent</a> of the staff at X, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-trump.html" title="">has said the tech billionaire will help lead</a> a Department of Government Efficiency alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Musk showed Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers the control room before the launch of a SpaceX rocket on Tuesday in South Texas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Brandon Bell</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Over the last week, Mr. Musk has kept up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/musk-trump-transition-mar-a-lago.html" title="">his buddy routine with Mr. Trump</a>, joining him at nearly every meeting at Mar-a-Lago as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/ufc-309-jones-vs-miocic-live-updates-fight-results-times/ULmFZNxvfvVj/Jjgbbyx58n9M/" title="">a U.F.C. fight</a>. On Tuesday, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/science/spacex-launch-starship.html" title="">brought the president-elect</a> to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas for a SpaceX launch.</p><p>In private meetings at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Musk shows little familiarity with policy or the potential staff members being discussed, but he returns repeatedly to a central point: What is required, he says, is “radical reform” of government and “reformers” who are capable of executing radical changes, according to two people briefed on the meetings, who insisted on anonymity to describe the internal conversations.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Musk, who often criticizes the mainstream news media, wrote <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an essay in The Wall Street Journal</a> with Mr. Ramaswamy that detailed more of their plan for the new agency they call DOGE.</p><p>Mr. Musk has not been particularly aggressive about pushing his preferred names for administration roles. But his tech-world orbit is emboldened and widely seen as influential.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mick Mulvaney, who served as Mr. Trump’s second chief of staff and now works at a lobbying firm, Actum, has told clients that tech executives are likely to have extraordinary access.</p><p>“Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, David Sacks, Joe Lonsdale and other tech leaders are influencing Trump’s preparations for his second term, something which no other business leaders have been able to do at this level in past presidential elections,” reads a presentation shared by Mr. Mulvaney with clients, which was seen by The New York Times.</p><p>But Mr. Mulvaney, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget, has sounded skeptical about Mr. Musk’s ability to deliver on his promised budget cuts.</p><p>He recently told clients on a call with about 70 people that Mr. Musk would find out that “going to Mars is easier,” according to a person who was listening and described the call. Mr. Mulvaney, the person added, said that he did not envision a wholesale change of how the federal government did business, and that he doubted Mr. Musk would stick around to actually get it done.</p><p>The tech leaders whom Mr. Mulvaney highlighted are indeed firmly in the transition conversation.</p><p>Several friends of Mr. Musk’s have been spotted at Mar-a-Lago in recent days, including Mr. Andreessen, Mr. Lonsdale and Ken Howery. Mr. Lonsdale, a founder of Palantir, has told peers that he was being considered for multiple roles, including secretary of education, but that he declined to move forward, wanting to stick to his business career and private philanthropy. Mr. Sacks, another friend of Mr. Musk’s, has also been involved in the Trump transition, joining calls and spending time at Mar-a-Lago in recent days, according to two people briefed on his activities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Other tech executives have been scrambling to broker introductions to Mr. Musk or his proxies. Across Silicon Valley, interest in serving in the Department of Government Efficiency is high. Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, <a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1858023954776207730" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> that work on social media this week as “a once in a lifetime opportunity to increase economic freedom in the U.S. and cut the size of government back to health.” Mr. Musk has been canvassing friends for their interest in formal administration roles, according to a person briefed on his outreach.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk attended a U.F.C. fight at Madison Square Garden this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Musk successfully pushed for Brendan Carr, a Republican, to be picked to lead the Federal Communications Commission — <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1858310171014897819" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a “great choice,”</a> the billionaire wrote after the announcement — although Mr. Carr had always been seen as the favorite. And Mr. Musk has pushed Mr. Trump to bring back Russell T. Vought, another budget director in Mr. Trump’s first term, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p><p>But Mr. Musk’s early record also has its blemishes. He <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1857880100034781233" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushed</a> for Emil Michael, a former top Uber executive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/technology/trump-elon-musk-silicon-valley.html" title="">to be the next transportation secretary</a>, only for Mr. Michael to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/sean-duffy-trump-transportation-dot.html" title="">lose out to Sean Duffy</a>, a former congressman from Wisconsin. Mr. Duffy was backed by Susie Wiles, who will become Mr. Trump’s chief of staff in January, and Reince Priebus, the president-elect’s onetime chief of staff, according to a person briefed on the process.</p><p>Mr. Musk also <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1857819784865362211" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a very public push</a> for Mr. Trump to choose Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, as his Treasury secretary. The president-elect ultimately declined, instead picking Mr. Lutnick <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/politics/howard-lutnick-trump-commerce-secretary.html" title="">for commerce secretary</a>. And Mr. Musk was a vociferous defender of former Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who on Thursday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/21/us/trump-gaetz-news" title="">withdrew</a> as Mr. Trump’s pick for attorney general.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s aides are divided on Mr. Musk’s role. Some see him as relatively harmless, and he is close with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html" title="">Stephen Miller</a>, a top policy aide. Others have chafed at his near-constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, especially given his lack of personal history with Mr. Trump.</p><p>So it is notable that Mr. Musk has appeared concerned about the perception of his influence. On Wednesday, in response to a headline describing him as Mr. Trump’s “closest confidant,” the tech billionaire <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1859296375113961850" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">went out of his way</a> to praise “the large number of loyal, good people at Mar-a-Lago who have worked for him for many years.”</p><p>“To be clear, while I have offered my opinion on some cabinet candidates, many selections occur without my knowledge and decisions are 100% that of the President,” he wrote on X.</p><p>It appeared to be a recognition of a well-known lesson in Trumpworld: Don’t outshine the boss. At least if you want to stay awhile.</p><p>Mr. Mulvaney’s advice for Mr. Musk? Be a straight shooter with Mr. Trump, because “there are plenty of people who will feel the need to agree with him all the time.”</p><p>“What makes Musk such a valuable adviser,” Mr. Mulvaney told The Times in an interview, “is that he has enough money — and enough other things to do — that he is uniquely situated to be the bearer of honest news. More than perhaps anybody else on the planet, he doesn’t need the job.”</p><p>Ryan Mac<!-- -->, <!-- -->Maggie Haberman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Jonathan Swan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering campaign finance and the influence of billionaires in American politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/theodore-schleifer">More about Theodore Schleifer</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>A Trump Orbit Full of Intrigue To Test Musk<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/22/us/politics/elon-musk-trump.html">1390</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">News and Analysis of Trump&#39;s Transition</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>New ‘DOGE’ Panel: </strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene will lead a new subcommittee that will partner with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s new Department of Government Efficiency to “eliminate government waste.” Her rise signals the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-doge-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy.html">ascendancy of the MAGA wing of the G.O.P. in Congress</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Trump Market: </strong>Because President-elect Donald Trump’s approach to politics and economics is so disruptive and unconventional, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/trump-stock-bond-market.html">markets have been straining to digest the implications of the power transfer in Washington</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What Bondi Might Do as Attorney General: </strong>Pam Bondi, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/dealbook/bondi-attorney-general-gaetz.html">Trump’s new pick to lead the Justice Department</a>, fought to overturn the Affordable Care Act, and has lobbied for Amazon, Uber and General Motors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Buttigieg’s Warning: </strong>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-trump-democrats.html">made a case for reorienting how the party communicates with voters</a>, even as he warned that expressing outrage at Trump would not be enough to lead Democrats to victory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recess Appointments: </strong>Trump could install appointees without Senate approval using what is known as a “recess appointment.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/politics/recess-appointment-trump-matt-gaetz.html">Here’s how that </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/politics/recess-appointment-trump-matt-gaetz.html">might work</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
