<p>After a brief departure from the organization, following contract expirations for four players and three coaches, Lakia returns to Gen.G for the second time. He joined midway through the team&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 2</a> campaign, but an early elimination and failure to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a> meant that he did not see the stage before his short-term deal with the team expired.</p>

<p>Lakia rejoins a Gen.G team that looks different from the one that he left in 2024. The only members remaining on the squad from that year are Duelist player <span data-ref-id="2">

</span>, Lakia is expected to take on the team&#39;s IGL role this upcoming season. As an Initiator player, his reintroduction to Gen.G&#39;s system is also expected to cause a shift in roles within the starting five. Former <span data-ref-id="6">

</span>, who has played the Initiator role since his call-up to the first team earlier this year, may move back to the Duelist role, which he played in his days with the academy squad. Gen.G&#39;s 2025 agent pools did not allow for double-Duelist team comps, but Lakia&#39;s arrival may allow Ash to do so, while also flexing into the Initiator role.</p>

	<p>I trust Gen.G coaching staff to make him into a world class IGL, on top of his utility usage if the 5th is able to play well fragging wise to support karon and t3xture we still have a shot</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="5881360" id="21">

	
	
	<p>his utility was always good just shooting was not top cause of his wrist injery </p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="5881663" id="31">

	
	
	<p>Yeah thats what I mean, if his util is good and he does FINE with the 5th (prob Zynx) is able to frag then the team is still strong</p>

	<p>Tbh munchkin to lakia is definitely an igl downgrade</p>

	

	
	
</div><div><div data-post-id="5883778" id="39">

	
	
	<p>Doesn&#39;t matter, solo is excellent at building up an IGL, and Lakia is probably a better base to build off.</p>

	<p>There is no way Lakia wasn&#39;t calling in some way on that 2024 GenG team because he was ASS (I love him don&#39;t get me wrong) and that team was so successful, hopefully they can find that success again with him.</p>
