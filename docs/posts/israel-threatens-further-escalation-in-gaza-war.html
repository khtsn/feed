During the truce, Hamas freed about 30 living hostages and returned the bodies of eight others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He said the Israeli military would use “tremendous force, from the air, land and sea” to destroy Hamas bunkers both above and below ground, and keep up the evacuations of Gazans who again are being forced to leave their homes to escape the strikes. Already, hundreds of thousands of Gaza residents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-evacuations.html" title="">have been displaced</a>.</p><p>These measures aim to “bring about the release of all the hostages,” Mr. Katz said, while carving out a path to defeat Hamas later.</p><p>“If Hamas persists in its refusal, the activity will expand and move to the next stages,” Mr. Katz said.</p><p>An American proposal, introduced last month by the Trump administration envoy Steve Witkoff, would require Hamas to release some living hostages without guarantees from Israel that it would permanently end the war — something Hamas has been demanding.</p><p>Hamas has rejected the U.S. plan as well as demands that it disarm as part of an eventual settlement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But frustration is mounting in Israel that the ramped-up war is putting the remaining hostages in greater peril.</p><p>On Wednesday, hundreds of former senior Israeli police officials joined a group of nearly 1,000 active-duty and reserve forces who had earlier called for a negotiated agreement to free the hostages immediately.</p><p>And U.N. officials said time was running out for the nearly two million Gazans who depend on foreign aid for survival.</p><p>The aid that was delivered to Gaza during the cease-fire that ended last month has “practically run out,” said John Whyte, the acting deputy director of the Gaza operations for UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“We are facing once again the prospect of famine,” Mr. Whyte warned on Tuesday.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Food distribution in Jabaliya this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Separately, the main U.N. agency for humanitarian affairs said that Israel’s intensified military operations, aid blockade, evacuation orders and disruption of health care “are driving what is likely the worst humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip since October 2023.” It cited vast food and water insecurity and attacks on hospitals that have disrupted “an already decimated health system.”</p><p>Mr. Katz said that while the Israeli military would continue to block humanitarian aid to Gaza, he also called for “creating an infrastructure for distribution through civil society later on.”</p><p>That prompted an immediate backlash from rival officials in Israel’s government who accused him of giving into Hamas, which has some control of how food is distributed in the territory.</p><p>“Cutting off aid is one of the main levers of pressure on Hamas, and returning it before Hamas gets on its knees and releases all of our hostages would be a historic mistake,” Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, said on social media.</p><p>Mr. Katz said his comments were being distorted by “those who try to mislead.”</p><p>“Israel’s policy is clear and no humanitarian aid is about to enter Gaza,&#34; he said in a follow-up statement.</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
