The sheriff’s department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday evening.</p><p>It was unclear on Wednesday evening what had caused the collapse. A spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Transportation declined to answer additional questions on Wednesday evening but said that it would share more information when it becomes available.</p><p>According to the department, the bridge has been closed to traffic since Sept. 18 as part of a bridge replacement project. The contractor was in the process of demolishing the bridge when it gave way, the agency said.</p><p>An inspector with the transportation department was at the work site when the bridge collapsed but was unharmed, the department said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Simpson County, in south-central Mississippi, has a population of about 26,000 people, <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Simpson_County,_Mississippi?g=050XX00US28127" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to census data</a>.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
