Mr. al-Shara, who led the overthrow of Mr. al-Assad in December, had promised to form an inclusive government and he heralded this as the beginning of what he called “a new history” for the nation after decades of dictatorship and a long civil war.</p><p>The declaration guarantees “freedom of opinion, expression, information, publication and press.” If upheld, this would be a dramatic departure from the draconian surveillance state under Mr. al-Assad. It also pledges to safeguard women’s rights and the rights of all Syrians during a five-year transitional period, after which a permanent constitution will be adopted and elections for a president and parliament will be held.</p><p>However, some among Syria’s diverse mix of ethnic and religious groups remain skeptical of the new leader’s sweeping promises to create an inclusive government because of his roots as the head of an Islamist extremist rebel group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-5a592c82">The president&#39;s powers</h2><p>The temporary constitution grants the president executive authority and the power to declare a state of emergency. The president will appoint one-third of the legislature, which will serve as an interim parliament for the transition period. The other two-thirds will be chosen by electoral commissions overseen by a committee appointed by the president.</p><p>The new constitution calls for judicial independence. But the president is solely responsible for appointing judges to Syria’s new constitutional court, the body ostensibly intended to hold Mr. al-Shara accountable. The document does not grant power to any other body to approve his appointments but specifies only that judges must be impartial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators protested the constitutional declaration in Qamishli, Syria.

And like its precursor, the new constitution gives central importance to Islamic law. The new document says it will be the main source of legislation, while ensuring that “freedom of belief is guaranteed.”</p><p>However, all rights, including freedom of religion, may be curtailed if they are deemed to infringe on national security or public order, among other things, the constitution says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thousands of men prayed at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in December.

Since sweeping to power in Damascus, skeptics have questioned Mr. al-Shara’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html" title="">true beliefs</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As a rebel leader, Mr. al-Shara commanded an Islamist armed group once allied with Al Qaeda. Some question whether he has truly abandoned his former hard-line jihadist views, even though his rebel group severed ties with Al Qaeda years before he took power.</p><h2 id="link-4fc86aea">Pledges to safeguard minorities</h2><p>Syria is home to a diverse range of ethnic and religious groups, and the constitution promises to protect the rights of all Syrians and shield them from discrimination. But sectarian tensions linger, and they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/middleeast/syria-violence.html" title="">erupted viciously last week</a> when Assad loyalists ambushed government security forces, prompting a harsh crackdown that devolved into sectarian attacks on civilians, according to the United Nations and war monitoring groups.</p><p>The war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nearly 1,500 civilians were killed in just a few days of violence.</p><p>Those attacks appear to have been directed against the Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shiite Islam to which the Assad family belongs. The attacks were a reminder that Mr. al-Shara is still far from having secured control over all Syrian territory, and possibly even over all forces linked to the government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Houses of Syrian army officers from the Alawite minority burning south of Damascus in December.

The lifting of those sanctions remains a crucial step to resurrecting the country’s battered economy — one of the most pressing challenges for Mr. al-Shara’s government.</p><p>Even though the constitution pledges to protect minority rights, it has sparked concern among at least one major ethnic minority, the Syrian Kurds.</p><p>The Syrian Democratic Council, the political wing of the Kurdish-led forces that control northeastern Syria, said the new document “reproduced authoritarianism in a new form” and criticized what it said were unchecked executive powers.</p><p>It is unclear whether Kurdish dissatisfaction with the constitution will affect an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/middleeast/syria-kurds-agreement.html" title="">agreement reached this week</a> between the country’s new government and the Kurdish-led forces backed by the United States to incorporate them into the government’s civil and military institutions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-422e9bae">Freedom, with some exceptions</h2><p>The pledge to guarantee freedom of opinion, expression, information, publication and press” comes with some exceptions, including glorifying the Assad regime.</p><p>The constitutional declaration guarantees women’s rights to education and work, adding that they will have full “social, economic and political rights.”</p><p>Since his ascent to power, Mr. al-Shara has appeared keen to assuage domestic and international concerns over the role of women in the new Syria. In January, he delivered a speech using gender-sensitive language, rarely used by leaders in the region. He highlighted the role of women in the revolution, and the suffering they had experienced.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
