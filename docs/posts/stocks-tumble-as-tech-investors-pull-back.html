<p>World Stock Markets This Month</p>
</div></section><div></div><p><time datetime="2025-04-16T09:33:39-04:00"><span>April 16, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>9:33 a.m. ET</span></span></time></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/100000010113454" data-version="es" title="Read in Spanish">Leer en español</a></p></div></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Stock markets tumbled on Wednesday on renewed signs that the global trade war could dent the financial results of some of the world’s largest technology companies.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 opened 1 percent lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell even more, sinking about 2 percent in early trading.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/nvidia-h20-chip-china-restrictions.html" title="">Nvidia</a>, the American chip giant, revealed that the U.S. government would restrict sales of some of its chips to China, signifying the first major limits that the Trump administration has put on semiconductor sales abroad. Nvidia dominates the market for chips used in building artificial intelligence systems and will now require a license to sell A.I. chips to China.</p><p>In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion hit because of piles of chips it would not be able to sell and orders it would not be able to fill. Shares of Nvidia, which exert great influence over market indexes because of the company’s size, fell about 6 percent in early trading.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>AMD, another chip maker, said in a filing on Wednesday that the export controls would result in charges of $800 million to its “inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves.” The company’s stock also sank 6 percent.</p><p>And in Europe, shares of ASML, the Dutch company whose machines are essential for manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors, fell more than 4 percent on Wednesday after it said that orders for its equipment had fallen short of expectations. Christophe Fouquet, the company’s chief executive, said the Trump administration’s tariffs had “increased uncertainty.”</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell about half a percent, with most markets in the region trading lower.</p><p>Stock market benchmarks in Japan fell 1 percent on Wednesday. Share prices were down 2 percent in Hong Kong and 2 percent in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/business/china-taiwan-tariffs-chips.html" title="">Taiwan</a>, a hub of global chip manufacturing.</p><p>The maker of most of the world’s advanced chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, dropped 2.5 percent. Its South Korean chip-making rivals, Samsung and SK Hynix, each fell over 3 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s whipsawing tariff policies are still driving sentiment in global markets, especially in sectors facing the threat of more levies or potential reprieves.</p><p>A recent survey by Bank of America showed that global investors have cut their U.S. stock holdings by a record amount in the past two months, and that the potential for a recession spurred by Mr. Trump’s trade war poses a major risk to markets.</p><p>Gold, a traditional safe haven during times of turmoil, rose to another record high on Wednesday, pushing above $3,300 per ounce for the first time. The price of the precious metal has jumped more than 25 percent this year.</p><p>Census Bureau data released on Wednesday showed that shoppers ramped up spending on big-ticket items in March, ahead of Mr. Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement. Retail sales, which are not adjusted for inflation, rose 1.4 percent from the previous month — the jump in more than two years.</p><p>Sales of cars and car parts, in particular, rose 5.3 percent in March. Electronics and appliance purchases rose 0.8 percent. Consumer spending is the engine of economic growth, and the fresh data, while robust, came against a backdrop of falling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/business/consumer-confidence-trump.html" title="">consumer confidence</a> and concerns about the potential inflationary effects of tariffs.</p><p>“While normally that would be a good thing for markets, it is very possible that consumers are front-loading their purchases, and we may be seeing an artificial bump in sales,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management.</p><p>Tripp Mickle<!-- --> and <!-- -->Adam Satariano<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-ltd">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on U.S.-China Relations</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Pursuing Activists Abroad: </strong>The U.S. fired a new round of sanctions at China, targeting Chinese and Hong Kong officials over what it described as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/china-hong-kong-sanctions.html">acts of transnational repression</a> for their crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and on U.S. soil.</p></li><li><p><strong>Export Restrictions</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration added 80 primarily Chinese companies and organizations to a list of companies that are barred from buying American technology and other exports because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/business/economy/trump-chinese-tech-firms-chips-security.html">national security concerns</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Consulting Firm Employees Freed: </strong>China has released five employees of an American corporate investigations firm, the Mintz Group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/china-mintz-release-us.html">two years after they were detained</a> as part of a crackdown by Beijing on foreign business consultancies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Panama Canal Deal: </strong>Beijing’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/business/trump-panama-canal-china-hong-kong.html">threat to stop a tycoon’s sale</a> of his ports business has dealmakers wondering if they can still operate without political interference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Voice in Beijing:</strong> Senator Steve Daines of Montana, one of President Trump’s top allies in Congress, has cast himself as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/world/asia/trump-china-xi-daines.html">an intermediary between the Trump administration and Beijing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>China Says It Offers Stability: </strong>China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, cast his country as a bulwark for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/asia/china-tariffs-us-trump.html">peace and stability in a world thrown into chaos by the Trump administration</a>, even as Beijing provokes its neighbors and fuels trade tensions.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
