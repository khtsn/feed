Mr. Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 but later recovered, she said.</p><p>Tall and handsome in a rock-star sort of way, Mr. Kilmer was in fact cast as a rocker a handful of times early in his career, when he seemed destined for blockbuster success. He made his feature debut in the slapstick Cold War spy-movie spoof “Top Secret!” (1984), in which he starred as a crowd-pleasing, hip-shaking American singer in Berlin unwittingly involved in an East German plot to reunify the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He gave a vividly stylized performance as Jim Morrison, the emblem of psychedelic sensuality, in Oliver Stone’s “The Doors” (1991), and he played the cameo role of Mentor — an advice-giving Elvis as imagined by the film’s antiheroic protagonist, played by Christian Slater — in “True Romance” (1993), a violent drug-chase caper written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/01/multimedia/01Kilmer-3-wkjl/01Kilmer-3-wkjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/01/multimedia/01Kilmer-3-wkjl/01Kilmer-3-wkjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/01/multimedia/01Kilmer-3-wkjl/01Kilmer-3-wkjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A Black &amp; White photograph of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison in a Black shirt singing into a microphone." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/01/multimedia/01Kilmer-3-wkjl/01Kilmer-3-wkjl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/01/multimedia/01Kilmer-3-wkjl/01Kilmer-3-wkjl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/01/multimedia/01Kilmer-3-wkjl/01Kilmer-3-wkjl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 709w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/01/multimedia/01Kilmer-3-wkjl/01Kilmer-3-wkjl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1417w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/92563874-893c-5ade-893c-0f19d7ec527a" decoding="async" width="600" height="867"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Val Kilmer as the rock singer Jim Morrison in the 1991 film “The Doors.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tri-Star Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Kilmer had top billing (ahead of Sam Shepard) in “Thunderheart” (1992), in which he played an unseasoned F.B.I. agent investigating a murder on a South Dakota Indian reservation, and in “The Saint” (1997), a thriller about a debonair, resourceful thief playing cat-and-mouse with the Russian mob. Most famously, perhaps, between Michael Keaton and George Clooney he inhabited the title role (and the batsuit) in “Batman Forever” (1995), doing battle in Gotham City with Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey), though neither Mr. Kilmer nor the film were viewed as stellar representatives of the Batman franchise.</p><p>“Serious audiences will be less interested than ever in what’s under Batman’s cape or cowl,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “There’s not much to contemplate here beyond the spectacle of gimmicky props and the kitsch of good actors (all of whom have lately done better work elsewhere) dressed for a red-hot Halloween.”</p><p>But by then another, perhaps more interesting, strain of Mr. Kilmer’s career had developed. In 1986, Mr. Scott cast him in his first big-budget film, “Top Gun” (1986), the testosterone-fueled adventure drama about Navy fighter pilots in training, in which Mr. Kilmer played the cool, cocky rival to the film’s star, Tom Cruise. It was a role that set a precedent for several of Mr. Kilmer’s other prominent appearances as a co-star or a member of a starry ensemble. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/27/movies/top-gun-maverick-questions.html" title="">reprised it</a> in a brief cameo in the film’s 2022 sequel, “Top Gun: Maverick.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, VAL KILMER, left, as Lieutenant Tom &#39;Iceman&#39; Kazanski, RICK ROSSOVICH as Slider and TOM CRUISE as Lieutenant Pete &#39;Maverick&#39; Mitchell in the 1986 film &#34;Top Gun.&#34;</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ralph Nelson/Paramount Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He played the urbane, profligate gunslinger Doc Holliday in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/24/movies/a-fractious-old-west-in-a-modern-moral-universe.html" title="">“Tombstone”</a> (1993), a bloody western, alongside Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton as Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp. He was part of a robbery gang in “Heat” (1995), a contemporary urban “High Noon”-ish tale that was a vehicle for Robert De Niro as the mastermind of a heist and Al Pacino as the cop who chases him down. He was a co-star, billed beneath Michael Douglas, in “The Ghost and the Darkness” (1996), a period piece about lion hunting set in late 19th century Africa. In “Pollock” (2000), starring Ed Harris as the painter Jackson Pollock, he was a fellow artist, Willem de Kooning. He played Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell), in Oliver Stone’s grandiose epic “Alexander” (2004).</p><p>Throughout his career Mr. Kilmer often left an impression, with movie viewers as well as moviemakers, of unpredictability.</p><p>“Most actors recognize there’s something different in Val than meets the eye,” Mr. Stone said in a 2007 interview for a segment of the television series “Biography.” The playwright and screenwriter David Mamet, who directed Mr. Kilmer in the political thriller “Spartan” (2004), noted, “What Val has as an actor is something that the really, really great actors have, which is they make everything sound like an improvisation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kilmer in 1999.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jerry Watson/Camera Press, via Redux</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On the screen, he was both charismatic and curiosity-piquing, an actor who didn’t let his characters give emotional clues away easily.

A 1996 cover article about him in Entertainment Weekly was titled “The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate.”</p><p>“He offended people by being hard to understand,” said Mr. Stone, one of several people who said over the years that Mr. Kilmer turned them off before turning them back on again.

His father, Eugene, a real estate developer, and his mother, Gladys (Ekstadt) Kilmer, divorced when Val was 9. A younger brother, Wesley, drowned in a swimming pool in 1977, an event that haunted Mr. Kilmer for years afterward.</p><p>His memories of that loss were at the center of his performance in “The Salton Sea” (2002), about a man driven by guilt who seeks redemption after witnessing the murder of his wife and not being able to save her. “There are several points in the movie where the guy just can’t go on,” Mr. Kilmer said in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/21/movies/film-a-long-lingering-grief-serves-a-new-role.html" title="">an interview</a> with The Times in 2002. “I didn’t really get back to earth until about two or three years after my brother died.”</p><p>He applied to the Juilliard School in New York and at 17 became one of the youngest students ever admitted to the acting program there. At Juilliard, he and several classmates wrote and performed “How It All Began,” adapted from the autobiography of the West German urban guerrilla Michael Baumann. In 1981, after Mr. Kilmer graduated, he appeared in a professional production of the play at the Public Theater.</p><p>He made his Broadway debut in 1983 in “The Slab Boys,” a drama by John Byrne about young workers in a Scottish carpet factory with a cast that also included Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. He later played Hamlet at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival in Boulder in 1988 and the male lead, Giovanni, opposite Jeanne Tripplehorn in a Public Theater production of the lurid Jacobean tragedy “’Tis Pity She’s a Whore,” directed by JoAnne Akalaitis, in 1992.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kilmer in the 2002 film “The Salton Sea.” He played a man driven by guilt who seeks redemption after witnessing the murder of his wife and not being able to save her. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Castle Rock Entertainment</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Kilmer’s marriage to the actress Joanne Whalley, whom he met on the set of Ron Howard’s children’s fantasy film “Willow” (1988), ended in divorce. In addition to their daughter, his survivors include their son, Jack. Mr. Kilmer lived on a ranch near Santa Fe for many years and once pondered a run for governor of New Mexico.</p><p>Mr. Kilmer’s other significant film credits include “The Island of Dr. Moreau” (1996), a horror movie based on an early novel by H.G. Wells; “Wonderland” (2003), a murder story based on a true crime in which he played the pornography star John Holmes; and “Twixt” (2011), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, about a horror writer whose book tour takes him to a creepy town haunted by a murder of children years earlier.</p><p>Like his fellow actor Hal Holbrook, Mr. Kilmer had a longstanding fascination with Mark Twain, and he spent many years researching and writing a one-man play, <a href="http://valkilmer.com/blog/entry/citizen-twain-upcoming-performances" title="A clip from the one-man show" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Citizen Twain,”</a> which he began performing around the country in 2010. (Mr. Kilmer, who had trouble managing his weight, gave his interest in Twain credit for helping him slim down at last.)</p><p>He also appeared as Twain in a 2019 film version of that play, “Cinema Twain,” and in a 2014 film adaptation of Twain’s work, “Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn,” and he had planned to direct and star in a film he wrote about Twain and Mary Baker Eddy, the woman who founded Christian Science, whom Twain repeatedly criticized. Mr. Kilmer was a Christian Scientist.</p><p>In 2021, Mr. Kilmer was the subject of “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14731254/awards/?ref_=tt_awd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Val</a>,” a documentary based on decades of archival footage. His children were associate producers, and Jack Kilmer was the narrator.
