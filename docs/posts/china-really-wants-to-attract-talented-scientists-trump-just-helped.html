It had drawn some of the world’s best researchers to its campuses, people decorated with Nobel Prizes, MacArthur “Genius” grants and seemingly every other academic laurel on offer.</p><p>Now the Trump administration’s policies might soon bolster China’s efforts.</p><p>Under President Trump, the United States is slashing the research funding that helped establish its reputation as the global leader in science and technology. The president is also attacking the country’s premier universities, and trying to limit the enrollment of international students.</p><p>Scientists from China are under particular pressure, as U.S. officials have said that they may pose a national security threat by funneling valuable knowledge to China. Chinese-born scientists have been investigated or even arrested. Last week, the Trump administration said it would work to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/china-student-visas-revoke.html" title="">aggressively revoke</a>” the visas of Chinese students in “critical fields.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As a result, many scholars are looking elsewhere.</p><p>And Chinese institutions have been quick to try and capitalize.

Westlake is a prime example.</p><p>Established in 2018 <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2140178/new-university-seeks-global-prestige-helping-china-challenge-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by several high-profile scientists</a> who had themselves returned to China from the West, Westlake’s campus exudes technological advancement. A spaceship-like tower looms over rows of research laboratories. Computing centers and animal testing facilities cluster around a central lawn, in a shape designed to evoke a biological cell.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In its main academic building, portraits of dozens of professors are on display — all of whom were recruited from overseas. There is <a href="https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/kunliang-guan.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guan Kunliang</a>, a biochemist who won a MacArthur “Genius” grant while in Michigan; <a href="https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/jianjun-cheng.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cheng Jianjun</a>, a materials engineer honored multiple times by the National Science Foundation; <a href="https://sls.westlake.edu.cn/en/NEWS/201912/t20191215_2935.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yu Hongtao</a>, a Harvard-educated cell biologist who received millions in funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland.</p><p>Recruitment notices advertise high compensation, in line with those at top foreign universities.</p><p>Westlake has been perhaps the most successful Chinese university at recruiting overseas talent, but it is far from the only one. Between 2010 and 2021, nearly 12,500 scientists of Chinese descent left the United States for China, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/action/oidcStart?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1073%2Fpnas.2216248120" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a study published</a> in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The rate of departure was accelerating: More than half of them left in just the five years between 2017 and 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Portraits of world-class scientists displayed in the main academic building of Westlake University in Hangzhou.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vivian Wang/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The trend has only continued in the last few years, said Yu Xie, a professor at Princeton University who coauthored the study.</p><p>Nor is it only Chinese-born scientists who are jumping ship. Charles Lieber, a former Harvard chemist who was convicted in 2023 of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/science/charles-lieber.html" title="">failing to disclose payments</a> from a Chinese university, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3308723/former-harvard-professor-convicted-over-china-ties-joins-tsinghua-university" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently joined Tsinghua University</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Chinese scientists have long flocked to American universities, lured by the promise of a world-class education and resources that their home country could not provide. In the 1980s, Chinese scientists who visited the United States would collect disposable test tubes to reuse in China, said Rao Yi, a neurobiologist at Peking University in Beijing, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/world/asia/07scholar.html" title="">who studied and worked</a> in the United States for two decades.</p><p>The admiration continued even as China’s economy boomed. In 2020, nearly one-fifth of Ph.D.s in science, technology, engineering and mathematics awarded in the United States went to students from China, according to data from the National Science Foundation. Historically, the vast majority of those Ph.D.s stayed in the United States — 87 percent between 2005 and 2015, the data showed. Many became U.S. citizens, and they have helped the United States accumulate <a href="https://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/viz-blog/chinese-talent-american-enterprise-five-takeaways-of-how-chinese-talent-contributes-to-biotech-innovation-in-the-u-s/4/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patents</a>, publications and <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1998/tsui/facts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Prizes</a>.</p><p>But in recent years, more scientists have been returning to China, drawn partly by government recruitment programs promising them <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-quietly-recruits-overseas-chip-talent-us-tightens-curbs-2023-08-24/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of dollars</a> in funding as well as housing subsidies and other perks. China’s spending on research and development is now second only to the United States. And Chinese institutions such as Tsinghua and Zhejiang University now routinely rank among the best in the world for science and technology.</p><p>The investment is part of a plan to turn China into a scientific superpower, especially in strategically important fields such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors and biotechnology.</p><p>“The scientific and technological revolution is intertwined with the game between superpowers,” China’s leader, Xi Jinping, <a href="http://www.news.cn/politics/leaders/20240624/16741a201e564d8d8775ffb1450ecf29/c.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last year</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At the same time, the United States has been pushing scientists away for years, in particular by investigating their ties with China. </p><p>Lu Wuyuan, a protein chemist formerly at the University of Maryland, was one of those targeted. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pall-suspicion-nihs-secretive-china-initiative-destroyed-scores-academic-careers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He was investigated</a> by the National Institutes of Health for allegedly failing to disclose research ties to China — ties he said Maryland knew about.

Many researchers criticized the campaign as racial profiling.</p><p>Professor Lu, who now works at Fudan University in Shanghai, said that many of his friends mused about leaving the United States, but most chose to stay because they had built lives there. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Trump administration’s assault on research funding may change that. </p><p>“If they cut so much funding, I believe that may be the last straw for many people,” Professor Lu said. </p><p>Still, China faces its own issues in poaching talent.</p><p>It has become harder for Chinese universities to meet and woo overseas scientists, as Chinese scholars have had trouble securing visas to the United States to attend academic conferences. Researchers in America also face restrictions in visiting China; Texas, for example, prohibits employees of public universities <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-issues-executive-order-hardening-state-government-from-the-chinese-communist-party" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from traveling to China for work</a>.</p><p>The scientists who have returned to China largely fall into a few categories: those who are early in their careers, or who are nearing retirement, or who felt pushed out by investigations. Established midcareer scholars are still reluctant to leave, multiple scientists said.</p><p>Professor Rao at Peking University, who was also one of Westlake’s co-founders, said that China’s progress in recruiting international talent had also been hampered by jealousy among domestic colleagues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Professor Rao Yi, left, watching students doing research in a laboratory at Peking University, in Beijing, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea Verdelli for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“While funding should increase, it is not the key factor at this stage,” Professor Rao said. “Supporting scientists based on merit and their good science is the key.”</p><p>And even at home, scientists are not spared political scrutiny. Chinese universities face limits on free expression, and China’s Ministry of State Security <a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1829192499512887282&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has warned</a> that scholars returning from overseas may be spies.</p><p>Multiple Chinese-born scientists — both those who had returned to China, and those still in the United States — emphasized that they did not want to get entangled in politics. They were just trying to do good work.</p><p>The simple fact was, many agreed, that it was increasingly easier to do so in China.</p><p>“It’s hard to survive in America. And China is developing so fast,” said Fu Tianfan, 32, an artificial intelligence researcher <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3303847/why-rising-ai-star-left-promising-us-academic-career-return-china" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who left</a> Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in December to join Nanjing University.</p><p>“Whether it was the best choice,” he said, “it may take some time to say.”</p><p>Siyi Zhao<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Wang is a China correspondent based in Beijing, where she writes about how the country’s global rise and ambitions are shaping the daily lives of its people.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
