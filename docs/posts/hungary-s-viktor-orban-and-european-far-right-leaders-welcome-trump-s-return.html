Trump and deriding Kamala Harris, described in one headline as “extremely unpleasant.” </p><p>In October, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/world/europe/eu-hungary-orban-ukraine-russia-china.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">the country’s leader vowed</a> to “open several bottles of Champagne if Trump is back.” And then, as U.S. voters went to the polls, scores of his supporters gathered for a celebratory party in Budapest before the results were even called.</p><p>No foreign leader gambled so heavily or publicly on a Trump victory as Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary. A fervent fan of the U.S. president-elect, Mr. Orban has greeted the election results with unrestrained glee.</p><p>Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Orban said he had “only partly delivered on his promise” about Champagne: He was in Kyrgyzstan when the result came through, and mostly drank vodka to “share our joy at this fantastic result.” He told his followers on X that he had already spoken with the president-elect, adding: “We have big plans.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For Mr. Orban and like-minded populist European politicians in Germany, the Netherlands, Serbia and elsewhere, this week’s election not only returned a fellow believer in tough immigration policies to the White House. It also sent a message to their own constituencies that history is moving in their direction and that political rivals they revile as woke, out-of-touch elitists are on the run.</p><p>“Politically this is a big win for Mr. Orban: He gambled and he won,” said Zsombor Zeold, a former Hungarian diplomat. More broadly, he said, the election of Mr. Trump “definitely puts wind in the sails of Europe’s populist right.”</p><p>Among those likely to get a lift, he said, are European parties affiliated with the Conservative Political Action Conference, an American pro-Trump organization that holds an annual gathering in Budapest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President-elect Donald J.

Deep currents of anti-Americanism run through the National Rally party of Marine Le Pen in France and Alternative for Germany, or AfD, for instance.</p><p>But they have cheered at the prospect of having Mr. Trump back in power.</p><p>The AfD leader, Alice Weidel, swiftly claimed common cause with Mr. Trump on Wednesday, saying, “He is of course a model for us.” His slogan of Make America Great Again, she told Deutschlandfunk radio, was no different from her party’s program of “making Germany great,” because “we as the AfD stand up for the national interests and for the people” of Germany.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Wilders and President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, a strongman leader who has in the past accused the State Department of working of working to topple him, enthusiastically welcomed Mr. Trump’s win.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Far-right leaders like Geert Wilders, the head of the Dutch Freedom Party, stand to potentially benefit from Mr. Trump’s re-election.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zoltan Mathe/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When Hungary assumed the European Union’s six-month rotating presidency in July, it stirred dismay by mimicking Mr. Trump and adopting the motto “Make Europe Great Again.” </p><p>How much Trumpism can be transferred to Europe beyond MAGA-like slogans remains to be seen. But its style and, on issues like immigration, its substance have already taken hold.</p><p>That is thanks in part to Mr. Orban, whose determination to keep migrants out by erecting high fences patrolled by sometimes brutal security forces drew widespread condemnation during Europe’s 2015 migration crisis. But Austria, Italy, Slovakia and many other countries have since emulated his tough stance on the issue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In Italy, the right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has long cultivated ties to Mr. Trump’s camp, and has praised him. Her party, which traces its roots to postwar fascist groups, has advocated controversial measures to control immigration, including a plan, stalled by Italian courts, to send would-be asylum seekers to detention camps in Albania.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ms. Meloni said she had spoken to Mr. Trump by telephone and congratulated him. The next day, she posted a message on X saying she had also congratulated Elon Musk, the billionaire supporter of Mr. Trump whom she referred to as a “friend.”</p><p>While Europe’s nationalist right is united in its admiration for Mr. Trump’s opposition to immigration and his disdain for establishment conventions, there are also differences.</p><p>Ms. Meloni’s robust support for NATO and its aid to Ukraine against Russia could put her at odds with Ukraine-skeptic strains of the MAGA movement. And neither Hungary nor Serbia shares Mr. Trump’s hard-line views on China, which they have both embraced as an indispensable economic partner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy in Rome in October.

Hungary is a country with less than 10 million far away in Central Europe — and has zero strategic influence.”</p><p>Mr. Orban himself acknowledged on Thursday that “size matters,” saying that the president-elect “has bigger things to do than dealing with the sufferings of Hungarians.”</p><p>Barnabas Heincz contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
