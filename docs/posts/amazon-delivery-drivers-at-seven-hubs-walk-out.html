Amazon said it expected the seven delivery hubs to operate normally.</p><p>The drivers are employees of companies that Amazon uses to deliver packages to customers. Amazon has said it has no obligation to bargain with the drivers because they are not its employees. But the union and the workers said Amazon ultimately controlled their working conditions and was therefore obligated to bargain with them.</p><p>The National Labor Relations Board has investigated some of the cases and issued at least one complaint finding the drivers to be Amazon employees and accusing the company of breaking the law by failing to bargain with them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Teamsters said in a statement that workers at other Amazon warehouses were prepared to join the strike. The largest group at Amazon represented by the union works at a Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8, which employs more than 5,000 people. Employees at the warehouse voted to unionize in 2022, but the company has yet to bargain with them and is challenging the election outcome.</p><p>Workers involved in the strike say it could extend into early next week, perhaps into Christmas, but it’s unclear how big an impact the walkout will have on Amazon’s holiday deliveries.</p><p>The company has <a href="https://www.mwpvl.com/html/amazon_com.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of delivery hubs</a> across the country, and 10 or more in some of the largest urban areas. It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/business/amazon-union-choke-points.html" title="">has said</a> that if one delivery hub experiences delays or driver shortages, the company can seamlessly shift packages to another hub nearby.</p><p>Amazon has also filled in gaps in its regular delivery fleet by summoning individuals through an on-demand Uber-like program known as Amazon Flex, in which people use their own cars to deliver packages.</p><p>Former delivery hub managers say these methods have helped the company reliably avoid disruptions in the past, though the ability to navigate a strike is likely to diminish during the holiday season, when the network has less spare capacity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the delivery hubs, Amazon generally hires contracting firms to take packages to customers. The Teamsters has organized the drivers who work there by asking them to sign authorization cards. The union typically proceeds by trying to organize individual contracting firms rather than an entire complex at once. In most cases, the owners of the contracting firms have yet to recognize the union and there have not been elections.</p><p>“What you see here are almost entirely outsiders — not Amazon employees or partners — and the suggestion otherwise is just another lie from the Teamsters,” Amazon said in a statement, referring to people picketing outside the delivery hubs. “The truth is that they were unable to get enough support from our employees and partners and have brought in outsiders to come and harass and intimidate our team.”</p><p>The Teamsters had set a deadline of Dec. 15 for Amazon to begin negotiating with the drivers and warehouse employees. It initiated the strike after Amazon failed to do so.</p><p>“If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon’s insatiable greed,” Sean O’Brien, the Teamsters president, said in a statement. “We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it.”</p><p>Three of the seven hubs are in Southern California, and the other four are in Queens; Atlanta; San Francisco; and Skokie, Ill., near Chicago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Outside the Amazon warehouse DBK4 in the Maspeth section of Queens, more than 200 people were walking the picket line at around 10 a.m.; about half appeared to have jobs connected to Amazon. They wore blue vests and carried signs that included slogans like “Amazon is unfair” and “Obey the law.” One protester led chants like “Shut it down!” over a megaphone.</p><p>The picket line was set up near the exit where delivery vans leave, and picketers tried to stop vehicles from leaving several times. By 11 a.m., police officers had set up barricades on the sidewalk, and more than a dozen Amazon delivery vans were able to exit. An hour later, the crowd had thinned, but dozens of people continued to picket.</p><p>Antonio Lopez, a 27-year-old driver who has delivered Amazon packages for more than three years, said he wanted better pay and working conditions, and for the company to support his career development.</p><p>“Anywhere is hard work, but people deserve to be paid for their hard work,” said Mr. Lopez, who earns around $23 per hour and is completing a certificate as a medical technician.</p><p>Drivers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/economy/amazon-delivery-drivers-labor-nlrb.html" title="">have complained</a> that Amazon pushes them to deliver hundreds of packages a day with little margin for error, while monitoring their movements and driving habits. Some say they resort to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/economy/amazon-delivery-drivers-labor-nlrb.html" title="">urinating in bottles</a> so that they don’t fall behind schedule.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Christian Santana, who has delivered goods for Amazon for more than two years, said the work conditions had taxed his physical health. “The workload never goes down,” Mr. Santana said, adding that he has frequently had to urinate in a bottle while delivering packages.</p><p>Amazon has said that while it sets safety and quality standards, the contractors that directly employ the drivers are responsible for enforcing them.</p><p>Looming over the conflict between the Teamsters and the company is the upcoming change in the federal government. Under President Biden, the National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/business/economy/trump-biden-labor-unions.html" title="">aggressively enforced</a> labor laws and brought many cases against employers.</p><p>The board pursued large financial remedies from employers that fired workers seeking to unionize and cracked down on mandatory meetings held by employers to discourage workers from organizing. And it has tended to conclude that large companies like Amazon have an obligation to bargain with employees of contractor firms over which the bigger companies exert control.</p><p>But the labor board was far less sympathetic to unions’ claims on these issues during the first administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump. And most union leaders expect Mr. Trump’s labor board appointees to be relatively unsympathetic to their claims during his second administration as well. That may be prompting some unions to pressure employers and seek concessions before Mr. Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. O’Brien, the Teamsters leader, spoke at the Republican convention this summer, and the union remained neutral in the presidential election — a break from recent campaign cycles. This appeared to give him some influence with Mr. Trump, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/economy/labor-secretary-lori-chavez-deremer-trump.html" title="">has tapped</a> a more union-friendly candidate to run his Labor Department than most Republican presidents have in recent memory.</p><p>But the labor board, not the department, has much more direct influence over workers’ ability to organize into unions, and it is unclear how much input Mr. O’Brien or the Teamsters will have on appointments to the board.</p><p>Amazon and SpaceX, which was founded and is led by Elon Musk, a close adviser to Mr. Trump, have both <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/21/musk-trump-nlrb-amazon-spacex/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">challenged the constitutionality</a> of the labor board in federal court. The cases are active.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Noam Scheiber is a Chicago-based reporter who covers workers and the workplace.
