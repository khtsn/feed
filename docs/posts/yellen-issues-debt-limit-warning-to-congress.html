    <h1>Yellen Issues Debt Limit Warning to Congress</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The United States borrows money to pay its bills and obligations, including funding for social safety net programs, interest on the national debt and salaries for members of the armed forces. If the United States is unable to raise the debt limit, it will soon be unable to make many of those payments, including to investors who have bought government debt.</p><p>“I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” Ms. Yellen said in a letter on Friday.</p><p>She explained that it was not precisely clear when she would have to begin taking steps, which usually include curbing certain government investments, to avoid a default. Because of a technical issue related to federal investments, she said, the Treasury Department expects that extraordinary measures would have to be employed sometime between Jan. 14 and Jan. 23.</p><p>As lawmakers negotiated last week over a government spending bill, Mr. Trump complicated matters by making a last-minute push for them to lift or eliminate the debt limit. Republicans have for years used the debt limit as leverage to force Democrats to go along with painful spending cuts while they are in power, so the gambit by Mr. Trump put members of his own party in a difficult position.</p><p>Ms. Yellen in 2021 called the debt limit “destructive” and said it should be eliminated. Her immediate predecessor as Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, expressed similar sentiments in 2017 when he described it as a “somewhat ridiculous concept” that did not limit spending.</p></div></div>
