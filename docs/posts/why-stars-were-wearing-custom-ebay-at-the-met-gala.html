At last night’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/05/style/met-gala-2025-red-carpet-looks.html" title="">Met Gala,</a> the theme of which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/style/black-dandyism-history-met-exhibition.html" title="">“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style</a>,” some attendees gave an unusual answer.</p><p>“I’m wearing Courrèges and eBay,” said Emma Chamberlain, who was hosting Vogue’s livestream of the glamorous fund-raiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute.</p><p>Jeremy Pope, the actor and singer, was similarly described as wearing a vintage Maison Margiela vest and “<a href="https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/fashion/met-gala-2025-ebay" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">custom eBay tailored trousers</a>.”</p><p>No, the online resale marketplace known for offering everything from used cars to Pokémon cards has not started a luxury fashion label. Rather, eBay has been one of the official sponsors of the Met Gala since 2024, and the numerous shout-outs to the company before, during and after the splashy event seemed to be a conspicuous reminder.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’m here with Burberry, but all of my accessories were sourced on eBay,” Law Roach, the stylist, was quoted as <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/shopping/met-gala-2025-ebay-accessories-law-roach-emma-chamberlain-best-vintage-jewelry-buy-online-1236208185/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying in The Hollywood Reporter</a>, referring to a Tiffany brooch, Cartier ring and Patek Philippe watch. “eBay is such a place to find treasures.”</p><p>It was Mr. Roach who styled Mr. Pope; the pair were featured in a TikTok video posted yesterday to the official eBay account, which noted how they were “helped by eBay” to source Mr. Pope’s sartorial tribute to Black dandyism.</p><p>Chappell Roan was another celebrity attendee who rocked eBay, so to speak: According to Vogue, <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/chappell-roan-met-gala-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the singer worked with Paul Tazewell</a>, the costume director of “Wicked,” to source her superfly patchwork pink suit and matching ’70s-style cape, which consisted of upcycled clothing found on the site.</p><p>EBay is not exactly a brand that gets mentioned in the same sentence as Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Even if the site does sell secondhand fashion from those labels, it is better known for its vast selection of vintage bric-a-brac — a Sony VCR, anyone? Its competitors, resale sites like the RealReal, Poshmark and Vinted, cater more to those seeking brand-name and luxury goods.</p><p>But eBay appears to be trying to seriously up its fashion credentials.</p><p>Alexis Hoopes, vice president of fashion for eBay, said that the site has always been a secret source for in-the-know fashionistas. But sponsoring the Met Gala is a way to promote its wide assortment of treasures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“For us, last night saw such diversity of talent wearing eBay and how they put it together,” Ms. Hoopes said of Monday’s event. “It was a perfect example of the breadth of what we offer.”</p><p>In addition to the Met Gala sponsorship, two years ago eBay partnered with Vogue for the magazine’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/style/vogue-world-comes-to-london.html" title="">Vogue World, a celebrity-filled fashion event, in London</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSkl1Sc4KgI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a promotional ad</a>, the supermodel Twiggy declares herself an eBay shopper.</p><p>For the 2023 Met Gala, eBay and Vogue co-produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq0X_F9HS10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a behind-the-scenes video featuring Ice Spice</a>. The common link here is, of course, Anna Wintour, Vogue’s editor in chief and a co-chair of the Met Gala.</p><p>EBay also recently <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-watchlist/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">named Brie Welch as a resident stylist</a> and debuted a trend report. Ms. Welch will curate looks on the site, Ms. Hoopes said, and bring “all the different trends we’re seeing on the site together.”</p><p>Tiffanie Darke, a British fashion writer who publishes the Substack newsletter <a href="https://tiffaniedarke.substack.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“It’s Not Sustainable</a>,” which focuses on issues around sustainability in the clothing industry, said the partnership between the Met Gala, Vogue and eBay was “a huge leap” and was evidence of a “cultural shift.”</p><p>Ms. Darke viewed eBay’s presence at fashion’s biggest night as a recognition, even in high-fashion circles, of the trend toward secondhand clothing and a sustainable mind-set, especially as the prices of luxury goods have <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/fashion/luxury-is-too-expensive-what-should-brands-do" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">become too high</a> for many shoppers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“What consumers and media types have come around to is they can get all these luxury brands for a fraction of the price on eBay,” Ms. Darke said. “It’s no longer considered shameful to buy and wear preloved clothing. In fact, it’s considered quite smart.”</p><p>Emilie Furda, a representative for eBay, declined to disclose the financial arrangements between the company; Condé Nast, Vogue’s publisher; and the organizers of the Met Gala. Nor would she confirm whether Ms. Roan and other celebrities were paid by eBay to wear secondhand looks.</p><p>Still, as Ms. Darke noted, it is business. “Let’s not discount the expediency of taking money from someone who’s probably got a lot to offer,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Steven Kurutz covers cultural trends, social media and the world of design for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the 2025 Met Gala</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Dressing for the Met: </strong>The gala’s blue carpet style showcased <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/diljit-dosanjh-punjabi-singer-met-gala-2025.html">Diljit Dosanjh’s</a> nod to a maharaja from the Punjab region of India, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/janelle-monae-met-gala-2025.html">Janelle Monáe</a> as a “time-traveling dandy,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/ryan-coogler-2025-met-gala-look.html">Ryan Coogler’s</a> lifelong fashion dream of a cumberbund and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/anna-sawai-2025-met-gala-look-dior.html">Anna Sawai’s</a> changed-up look.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sculpted Curls, Dramatic Trains and No Pants:</strong> The themes of the night included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/sculpted-curls-met-gala-josephine-baker.html">hair styles seemingly inspired by the singer Josephine Baker,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/kim-kardashian-demi-moore-met-gala-2025.html">appendage-like trains</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/kim-kardashian-demi-moore-met-gala-2025.html"> </a>and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/met-gala-sabrina-carpenter-no-pants.html">lots of leg</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kamala Harris’s Surprise Appearance:</strong> The former vice president skipped the carpet, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/kamala-harris-met-gala-2025.html">slipped into the gala in a black silk gown</a> in one of her first major public appearances since the 2024 election.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rihanna at the Gala:</strong> Fashionably late, the pop star <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/rihanna-pregnant-met-gala-2025.html">seemed to confirm rumors she was pregnant</a> when she met shouts of congratulations with: “Thank you!”</p></li><li><p><strong>Diddy&#39;s Shadow: </strong>Sean Combs was lauded by Anna Wintour, was a regular guest at the gala, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/style/diddy-sean-combs-met-gala.html">his influence on the current exhibition is undeniable</a> despite awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Black Dandy Fashion: </strong>It’s easy to forget that the Met Gala isn’t just an expensive-looking celebrity parade: It’s also the opening celebration for a museum show.
