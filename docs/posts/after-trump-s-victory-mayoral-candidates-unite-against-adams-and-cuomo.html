Trump as president, and who might be the best mayor to lead that effort?</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/nyregion/somos-puerto-rico-lobbying.html" title="">political conclave known as Somos</a>, the need to battle a Trump administration offered some room for consensus for the five Democrats running to unseat Mayor Eric Adams in next June’s primary.</p><p>So did another shared view: Neither Mr. Adams nor another rumored candidate, the former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, deserved the support of voters.</p><p>“One of the things that absolutely unites us is a clear opposition to disgraced New York executives, whether that is Adams or Cuomo,” said Zohran Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens and mayoral candidate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Adams and Mr. Cuomo were not in attendance. Mr. Adams, a Democrat, had planned to go but canceled his trip late in the week. Three years ago, he relished <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/07/nyregion/eric-adams-somos-mayor.html" title="">a rock-star</a> presence at Somos; now the mayor, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">indicted on federal corruption charges</a> in September, has seen his poll numbers sink to record lows.</p><p>Critics of Mr. Cuomo are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/16/cuomo-politics-comeback-critics-00183836" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mobilizing to torpedo his potential candidacy</a> after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/nyregion/poll-eric-adams-resign.html" title="">polls showed that he could be a top contender</a>. A group that opposes him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VLAqulgrL4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a digital ad</a> targeted to Somos attendees about the sexual harassment allegations that prompted Mr. Cuomo to step down in 2021. Mr. Cuomo has denied wrongdoing.</p><p>“In this moment, New Yorkers are going to be more motivated than ever to fight back against anyone who is known for bullying people, harassing women and mishandling public health,” said Peter Kauffmann, a former adviser to Mr. Cuomo who was behind the ad.</p><p>Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, dismissed the ad, calling it pathetic.</p><p>“New Yorkers see through the stunts pushed by these extremist fringe candidates and know that Gov. Cuomo is a fighter who spent over a decade delivering for them,” he said, citing Mr. Cuomo’s accomplishments, including raising the minimum wage and cutting taxes.</p><p>The mayor’s race is expected to soon begin in earnest, although the field and the environment are far from settled. Mr. Adams, who has faced calls to resign, is scheduled to go on trial in April. More candidates could still join the race, including Letitia James, the state attorney general.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In Puerto Rico, the five announced challengers — Mr. Mamdani; Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens; Brad Lander, the city comptroller; Zellnor Myrie, a state senator from Brooklyn; and Scott Stringer, a former city comptroller — were friendly and refrained from publicly taking shots at one another. They commiserated about the election over rum punches and plantains, practicing their stump speeches and courting allies.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jessica Ramos, center in a yellow dress, said that Democrats must focus on dinner-table and pocketbook issues.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>All the candidates are to the left of Mr. Adams and Mr. Cuomo. They echoed similar themes about addressing the city’s affordability crisis and how the next mayor should be competent.</p><p>Ms. Ramos told scores of union leaders at the Caribe Hilton on Saturday that Democrats must focus on “dinner-table issues and how we’re going to get more money in people’s pockets.”</p><p>“If there’s a lesson to take away, it’s that the Democratic Party should listen to the labor movement more often,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Lander questioned whether Mr. Adams would protect New Yorkers against Mr. Trump’s policies or seek to curry favor with him in the hope of a presidential pardon if Mr. Adams is convicted.</p><p>“If Eric Adams wants New Yorkers to believe he is putting their interests ahead of his own, he should announce today that he will not seek or accept a pardon from Donald Trump,” Mr. Lander said.</p><p>Mr. Myrie agreed. “I’m not confident as a New Yorker that he’s going to stand up to the president when the time is needed,” he said. “But even more important than that, before Trump’s election, he had been failing New Yorkers.”</p><p>Mr. Adams has hit back, criticizing the candidates who attended the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/nyregion/mayor-democrats-adams-forum.html" title="">first mayoral forum in the Bronx last month</a>. The mayor, who attended many similar events during the 2021 race, said he didn’t have time for “frivolous stuff” and claimed that the candidates “don’t get up until probably 11 a.m.”</p><p>His allies also made the rounds in Puerto Rico, arguing that Mr. Trump’s victory was a good sign for the mayor’s future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, a longtime ally of the mayor who leads the Brooklyn Democratic Party, said in an interview that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/trump-nyc-voters.html" title="">New York City’s shift to the right</a> showed that voters want a centrist like Mr. Adams. Their support of Mr. Trump also signaled that voters could support a candidate who was facing criminal charges, she said.</p><p>“It’s probably a bit more positive outlook for the mayor,” she said. “We in New York City have to find a way to work with the new administration, and Eric is probably the best person to do that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The New York City comptroller, Brad Lander, marched alongside immigrants and activists in a protest against the election of Donald Trump on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J. Blue for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On Friday night, Mr. Lander held a reception at an oceanfront terrace at the Fogo de Chao restaurant in San Juan that was attended by some of his allies, including Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, and <a href="https://x.com/nick_garber/status/1855028475280662834" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eric Gonzalez</a>, the Brooklyn district attorney. He had lunch earlier in the day with Tiffany Cabán, a democratic socialist City Council member.</p><p>Mr. Lander said that his takeaway from the election was that Democrats must “deliver a government that makes real progress on the actual material needs people have,” including affordable housing and child care.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Stringer, the former city comptroller, agreed, arguing that Democrats must “prove that we are the party of working people.”</p><p>Ms. Ramos, who speaks Spanish and whose parents are from Colombia, said she was disgusted by the comments at Mr. Trump’s recent rally at Madison Square Garden, where a comic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/puerto-rico-republicans-trump-msg-rally.html" title="">called Puerto Rico</a> a “floating island of garbage.”</p><p>“It’s really unfortunate that that’s the view they have of this beautiful place,” she said, adding that her first stop was always a restaurant called Platos for a plate of mofongo, a traditional dish in Puerto Rico.</p><p>It was the first year that Mr. Williams, who is afraid of flying, attended the annual gathering. If Mr. Adams were to resign, Mr. Williams would become acting mayor and would be likely to run for a full term.</p><p>Outside a reception held by the left-leaning Working Families Party, Mr. Williams said that the presidential election reflected a rejection of the status quo and longstanding currents of “anti-Blackness and misogyny.” He argued that the results were not a rejection of progressives, as some have argued.</p><p>“Blaming it on the left progressives, particularly when the Democratic Party didn’t adopt what they were asking for, is very shortsighted,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma G.
