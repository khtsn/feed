She said that “tens of thousands” of people who were overseas would be processed and admitted to the United States as refugees.</p><p>“The Ninth Circuit’s ruling insures that U.S. refugee admission remains open in part,” she said.</p><p>But it was a rare victory as well for the Trump administration and its efforts to clamp down on immigration. Appellate judges have largely upheld rulings by the district courts blocking the president’s agenda. In contrast, Tuesday’s decision reversed in part an earlier ruling by Judge Jamal N. Whitehead of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, who was nominated to the bench by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Judge Whitehead’s ruling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-refugee-program.html" title="">effectively required</a> the government to reinstate the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which has admitted more than three million refugees to the United States since it was <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/refugee-admissions/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">established by statute</a> in 1980.</p><p>Billions of dollars in funding for nonprofit groups that assist refugees with resettlement remain in limbo. After Judge Whitehead ordered the government to restore funding to the groups, the State Department terminated their contracts. A second order by Judge Whitehead, filed on Monday, ordered the government to reinstate the terminated funding. That order has not yet been considered by the appeals court.</p><p>Tuesday’s ruling by the appeals court is preliminary, and the court could eventually choose to either uphold or reverse Mr. Trump’s executive order in full.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A City’s Split:</strong> President Trump has made Aurora, Colo. synonymous with the supposed scourge of Venezuelan gangs, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/politics/trump-aurora-migrants.html">some wonder if his immigration raids are damaging the city more</a> than the migrants ever did.</p></li><li><p><strong> Attempts to Deport Columbia Undergraduate:</strong> A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/nyregion/columbia-university-protester-chung-deportation.html">halt its efforts to arrest and deport Yunseo Chung</a>, a legal permanent resident who immigrated from South Korea as a child, after she participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Judge Maintains Block on Deportations:</strong> A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/judge-ruling-trump-deportations-alien-enemies-act.html">kept in place his ruling</a> barring the Trump administration from using <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/alien-enemies-act-extraditions.html">a powerful wartime statute</a> to summarily deport Venezuelan immigrants accused of being members of a violent street gang.</p></li><li><p><strong>Migrant Children: </strong>Aid organizations were notified by the Trump administration that it would cancel a contract that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/migrant-children-legal-representation-funding.html">funds the legal representation of more than 25,000 children</a> who entered the United States alone, a decision that leaves them vulnerable to swift deportation.</p></li><li><p><strong> Watchdog Agencies Shut Down: </strong>The civil rights branch of the Department of Homeland Security and two ombudsman offices were shut down by the Trump administration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/trump-civil-rights-homeland-security-deportations.html">gutting the offices responsible for conducting oversight</a> of President Trump’s immigration crackdown.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
