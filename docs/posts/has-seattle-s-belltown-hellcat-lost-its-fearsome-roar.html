Mr. Hudson at times relished in the infamy, comparing himself to a Batman villain on the Instagram feed where he was finding glory among hundreds of thousands of followers who tracked his driving antics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-2"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>1:29</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Police bodycam footage released by the Seattle City Attorney’s Office showed an officer urging the driver, Miles Hudson, to take his modified Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat to a racetrack.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“If it’s essentially wildly outside of factory, it’s an issue. What’s that?” “Do you know the factory setting?” “Yeah, I’m an ASE certified master technician as well as a cop, believe it or not. I have a car that would smoke yours.” [laughing] “I mean —” “You just got to keep it on — dude, why don’t you go to Pacific Raceways?” I don’t, I don’t race. I do this. I do this on social media.” “I know. But you know how much more popular it would be if you were doing it on a track?” “I mean, I got almost 700,000 followers.” “What’s that? “I’ve got almost 700,000 followers.” “Seven-hundred thousand what?” “Almost 700,000 followers.” “Yeah?” “Yeah.” “What do you mean? I’m just saying, like —” “I’m not, no disrespect, but I feel like I’m doing my thing.” “I know, you’re doing your thing. But, but —” “[unclear], and the car is paying for itself — 650,000 followers.” “I got you, dude. But doing it, but doing it legit and not on the street is going to be safer. Like, remember when we talked last time? Do you remember — the last time you got pulled over in Seattle?” “I’ve been pulled over a lot.” “You only got pulled over once up in the North Precinct since I pulled you over.” “Well, I didn’t —” “For S.P.D.” “No, I got pulled over, pulled over in Kirkland, but that wasn’t —” “OK, so you live in Seattle, right? You’ve been pulled over three times in Seattle. Once was an officer in the North Precinct. Once was me in January and now it’s me again.” “No, it’s been more than, I mean, maybe those are the only times I got tickets I’ve been pulled over —” “No, no, I didn’t ticket you last time, I told you you car was cool, and I told you you needed to slow down.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/24/autossell/24vid-hellcat-video-cover/24vid-hellcat-video-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Police bodycam footage released by the Seattle City Attorney’s Office showed an officer urging the driver, Miles Hudson, to take his modified Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat to a racetrack.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Seattle City Attorney’s Office</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>At one point, responding to the pleas of a local police officer to take his vehicle to a racetrack instead, Mr. Hudson noted his social media success as a reason he would not be heeding their advice. To some city residents, the aggravating escapades became a symbol of selfishness in the social media era. To others, they were evidence that Seattle’s government was incapable of restoring order.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But now Mr. Hudson’s main social media account has gone silent — and people in downtown Seattle report that his car has, too. Chris Allen, a downtown resident who said the explosive noise of Mr. Hudson’s backfiring vehicle overpowered his nighttime white-noise machine, said he had not heard or seen Mr. Hudson’s vehicle since the summer. He said he felt a growing confidence that the Hellcat saga may be in the past.</p><p>“People are pretty happy that we are not having to deal with him anymore,” Mr. Allen said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chris Allen, a Belltown resident, was fed up with the infamous “Belltown Hellcat.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Van Lau for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Hudson, who did not respond to requests for an interview, has been contained not so much because of the city’s efforts to quiet his car but because of other troubling criminal cases lodged against him.</p><p>He was <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/crime/belltown-hellcat-driver-arrested-renton-warrant/281-518ab32f-4de1-4702-ac0d-31bf2a9e79fd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested in October</a> for failing to appear for a court hearing revisiting the terms of past domestic violence cases involving him and his mother. In one of those cases, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/us/seattle-belltown-hellcat-judgment.html" title="">documents show</a>, he was accused of damaging an armoire when she was late to pick him up for a haircut. In another, he was accused of pulling over the chair she was sitting in when she refused to make him coffee.</p><p>Mr. Hudson had pleaded guilty to an assault charge, avoiding a prolonged jail sentence as long as he met conditions that included no more criminal violations. But this year, he was charged with reckless driving. In another case, he was charged with stalking and with disclosing intimate images after an ex-girlfriend reported that he showed up at her workplace and home and sent explicit videos to someone else.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>To some residents, including Mr. Allen, the Hellcat case was a lesson in the importance of enforcing laws. The city had grown too lax, he said. He said he understood the importance of policies that seek to avoid saddling people with criminal records that could hamper their ability to get housing or jobs, but he felt leniency could create other problems.</p><p>“I think it just went too far, and now they are reeling it back in,” Mr. Allen said.</p><p>City prosecutors are preparing for a January trial, where they hope to convict Mr. Hudson of reckless driving.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mike Baker is a national reporter for The Times, based in Seattle.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mike-baker">More about Mike Baker</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Alienation of Jaime Cachua: </strong>His friends and family members in Rome, Ga., voted to support mass deportation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/us/trump-immigrant-deportations-rome-georgia.html">Now he’s scrambling to stay in the country</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brawls Fueled by Cellphones: </strong>Cafeteria melees.
