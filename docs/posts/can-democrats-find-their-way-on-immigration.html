    <h1>Can Democrats Find Their Way on Immigration?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Democrats onstage saw themselves as morally courageous. American voters, it turned out, saw a group of politicians hopelessly out of touch.</p><p>Standing side by side at a primary debate in June 2019, 10 of the party’s candidates for president were <a href="https://x.com/NBCNews/status/1144423171518619649" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked to raise their hand if they wanted to decriminalize illegal border crossings</a>. Only one of them held still.</p><p>Six years later, the party remains haunted by that tableau. It stands both as a vivid demonstration of a leftward policy shift on immigration that many prominent Democratic lawmakers and strategists now say they deeply regret, and as a marker of how sharply the country was moving in the other direction.</p><p>Last year, 55 percent of Americans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/trump-immigration-border.html" title="">told Gallup</a> that they supported a decrease in immigration, nearly twice as many as in 2020, and the first time since 2005 that a majority had said so. The embrace of a more punitive approach to illegal immigration includes not only white voters but also working-class Latinos, whose support Democrats had long courted with liberal border policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“When you have the most Latino district in the country outside of Puerto Rico vote for Trump, that should be a wake-up call for the Democratic Party,” said Representative Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, who saw Mr. Trump win every county in his district along the border with Mexico. “This is a Democratic district that’s been blue for over a century.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/02/multimedia/pol-immig9-hbfk/pol-immig9-hbfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/02/multimedia/pol-immig9-hbfk/pol-immig9-hbfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/02/multimedia/pol-immig9-hbfk/pol-immig9-hbfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A small group of adults and children watch Donald Trump speak on television as they sit around round tables in a nondescript room in a shelter." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/02/multimedia/pol-immig9-hbfk/pol-immig9-hbfk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/02/multimedia/pol-immig9-hbfk/pol-immig9-hbfk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/02/multimedia/pol-immig9-hbfk/pol-immig9-hbfk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/02/multimedia/pol-immig9-hbfk/pol-immig9-hbfk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7e92057a-6b77-52b6-9aec-41f67d18f52b" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Trump administration is pursuing the harshest crackdown on immigrants since World War II, an effort many Democrats see as a national crisis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriel V.

A <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-new-immigration-system-to-safeguard-americas-security-expand-economic-growth-and-make-us-stronger/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new proposal</a> from the Center for American Progress, the party’s leading policy shop, calls for expanding legal immigration while embracing ideas long championed by conservatives, including making it harder for migrants to qualify for asylum.</p><p>Neera Tanden, the center’s chief executive, said the plan acknowledged a reality that Democrats had long resisted: They must embrace new immigration restrictions in order to have the credibility with voters to fight the far more expansive plans of the Trump administration.</p><p>“I’m happy to argue with Stephen Miller or anyone else about why they are wrong,” she said. “But the way we’re going to be able to do that is to also honestly assess that the border has been too insecure, that it allowed too many people to come through and that we need to fix that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A soldier patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border near Santa Teresa, N.M., in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Many on the left vehemently disagree, insisting that more conservative policies will only aid what they see as an insidious and ambitious effort by the Trump administration to demonize and deport Black and brown immigrants who have been in the country for years, remaking the fabric of a nation that once took pride in its diversity.</p><p>“Democrats have to stop talking about the issue of immigration within a Republican frame,” said Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. “This has nothing to do with law and order. This is about power, control, terror, and it is about racism and xenophobia. Donald Trump wants to make America Jim Crow again, and then some.”</p><p>Complicating Democrats’ efforts to chart a new path is the fact that the party’s debate is unfolding in the midst of what it sees as a national crisis. The Trump administration is pursuing the harshest crackdown on immigrants since World War II. Raids and patrols by masked officers, detentions at courthouses and workplaces, the promises to arrest and deport millions, and the deployment of National Guard troops against protesters all have undocumented immigrants and even some naturalized citizens running scared and lying low.</p><p>“We, and I include myself in this, created a vacuum on this issue that we allowed the current president to fill,” said Cecilia Muñoz, who led the Obama administration’s domestic policy council. “And the country is now living with the results. And the results are appalling.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Barack Obama deported more undocumented immigrants in his first term than any president had since the 1950s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Peter Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Some Democrats believe their party can find its path forward by looking to the past.</p><p>It was under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, that Congress broadly expanded the grounds for deportation and that border enforcement officers saw their ranks increase sharply. The next Democrat to win the White House, Barack Obama, promised to pass comprehensive immigration legislation, including a pathway to legal status for an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Seeking Republican support, Mr. Obama also pursued aggressive enforcement, deporting more undocumented immigrants in his first term than any president had since the 1950s. But his attempts to balance the two priorities ultimately failed: His plan to modernize the immigration system stalled in Congress, while his executive actions to aid undocumented students, workers and families were challenged in the courts. Disillusioned advocates denounced him as <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/national-council-of-la-raza-janet-murguia-barack-obama-deporter-in-chief-immigration-104217.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the “deporter in chief.”</a></p><p>Then came Mr. Trump, who rode down the golden escalator at Trump Tower to announce his presidential campaign with promises to build a “great wall” along what he described as an out-of-control southern border and to expel migrants he condemned as criminals, drug traffickers and rapists.</p><p>As Mr. Trump competed for his party’s nomination, Hillary Clinton was under pressure in the Democratic primaries from Senator Bernie Sanders on the left. Immigration activists persuaded her to break with Mr. Obama’s approach — not to mention her husband’s — and pledge not to deport illegal immigrants beyond violent criminals and terrorists. But that promise fueled Mr. Trump’s candidacy more than it helped hers. He hammered away at her, saying she wanted to “abolish” the country’s borders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald J.

Their efforts focused mainly on curtailing enforcement and standing up to Mr. Trump. They said little about the economic and social benefits of expanding legal immigration.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s restrictive policies, particularly the separation of children from their families, inspired a broader backlash: By the time he left the White House, more Americans favored increasing immigration than opposed it for the first time in six decades of Gallup polling.</p><p>But soon after President Joseph R. Biden Jr. entered office, illegal crossings at the southern border began to increase, as pandemic lockdowns were lifted and would-be migrants in Central America responded to Washington’s changed tone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Some aides urged Mr. Biden to avoid the subject and stay focused on the pandemic, the economy, Afghanistan and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, issues more politically favorable to him.</p><p>“The through line in every decision they made around immigration was ‘What can we do to stop having to talk about this?’” said Carlos Odio, a founder of Equis, a Democratic-aligned polling firm specializing in Latino voters. “The problem is that doesn’t work when you’re in charge and people expect you to deal with everything.”</p><h2 id="link-35f8e551">A migrant crisis by the busload</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Over two years, Texas sent nearly 120,000 migrants to cities like New York, Chicago and Washington.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Arredondo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Republican governors made the subject impossible to avoid.</p><p>The first buses of migrants chartered by the Texas Division of Emergency Management pulled into Washington from Del Rio, Texas, in April 2022.

Greg Abbott, as a “political stunt.” But the buses kept rolling.</p><p>Over the next two years, Texas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/us/abbott-texas-migrant-buses.html" title="">sent</a> nearly 120,000 migrants to cities like New York, Chicago and Washington. Doug Ducey, then the governor of Arizona, sent buses to Denver, and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida flew migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, Mass.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>As Democratic governors and mayors struggled to house and feed the arrivals, Republicans blamed Mr. Biden for the crisis engulfing liberal cities.</p><p>Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas said she first realized Democrats were in trouble in December 2022. So many migrants were crossing into El Paso that they were sleeping on pizza boxes as temperatures fell below freezing. A city known as a haven for immigrants since the 1800s was overwhelmed. Residents were losing patience, she recalled.</p><p>Still, when she worked on bipartisan legislation to expedite asylum cases at the border, Ms. Escobar said, fellow Democrats criticized the proposal as too restrictive.</p><p>“Living through what El Paso lived through, feeling how unsustainable all of this was, and frankly how challenging this was, I knew this would cause a massive shift in the perspective of Americans about immigration,” she said. “There was a failure on the part of the Democratic Party altogether during the last administration in adequately recognizing what was happening.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An influx of migrants into El Paso overwhelmed a city known since the 1800s as a haven for immigrants.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivan Pierre Aguirre for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Democrats far from the border saw public opinion moving toward Republicans, too.</p><p>Lori Lightfoot, a former mayor of Chicago, recalled a homeless Black woman complaining that she could not get help finding an apartment because “they’re giving everything to the migrants.” The city’s established Mexican American communities, Ms. Lightfoot said, were not thrilled to welcome busloads of Venezuelans.</p><p>“What we started to hear, which was also a little bit of a surprise to me, was, ‘Hey, what about us? We’ve been here forever. Why are you paying attention to and giving resources to these newcomers who, by the way, you know’ — in soft voice — ‘are Venezuelans?’” she said.</p><p>Democratic mayors and governors begged Mr. Biden to authorize emergency aid and work permits for the migrants. Some took their criticisms public in frustration with what they saw as White House inaction.</p><p>But Biden aides were locked in furious debates over how, and how fast, to dismantle Mr. Trump’s policies and what should replace them. That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/us/politics/biden-border-immigration.html" title="">infighting</a> crippled the administration’s ability to respond quickly.</p><p>Congressional Democrats tried to step in, striking a compromise on a bipartisan border bill that would have made illegal entry more difficult while allowing admitted migrants to receive work permits more quickly. But Mr. Trump pressed Republicans to torpedo it, to deny Mr. Biden a victory and keep the issue inflamed heading into November.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>In New York that February, immigration and border politics overtook a special House election. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat, prevailed after adopting a hard-line approach, calling for a temporary <a href="https://pix11.com/news/local-news/suozzi-democrat-ny-says-southern-border-needs-to-close-temporarily/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shutdown of the border</a> and for <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/04/metro/deport-suozzi-pilip-say-migrants-who-beat-cops-must-get-booted/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deporting migrants</a> who assault the police.</p><p>Mr. Suozzi attributed his win to a willingness to take tough stands, as the Biden administration waited for legislation that would never happen.</p><p><strong>“</strong>I don’t think that the voters moved to the right,” he said. “I think they voted more for the Republicans because they felt that they were not getting attention paid to their concerns.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat, won a special House election after taking a tough stand on immigration and border security.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Watts for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>Mr. Biden finally responded to the crisis in June, issuing an executive order preventing migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border when crossings surge — the most restrictive border policy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/us/politics/biden-executive-order-border-asylum.html" title="">any modern Democrat has instituted</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Unlawful crossings plummeted.
