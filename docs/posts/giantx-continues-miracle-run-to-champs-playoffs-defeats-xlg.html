</span>, both trying to qualify for the playoff stage. In the end, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542199/giantx-vs-xi-lai-gaming-valorant-champions-2025-decider-a" target="_blank">GX swept XLG 2-0</a> to eliminate the final Chinese team from Paris.</p>

<p>The first map of the series was Bind, with XLG opting for a solo Waylay and double-Initiator composition, while GX chose double-Controller with Astra and Viper alongside a Deadlock and Raze. XLG took the first pistol thanks to the confidence of <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11527/noman">
		NoMan	</a>
</span>&#39;s Skye, and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/22047/rarga">
		Rarga	</a>
</span> got the eco kills to get his ult quickly on the attack side. Add onto that a bonus conversion, and XLG were running away with Bind to start. It took a round where <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/11332/ara">
		ara	</a>
</span> picked up the Operator for GX to get their first defense-side round win. Even then, just after, XLG had an amazing read to stop a B long retake and get a free site. GX&#39;s hope was built on strong rounds from ara and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/34684/westside">
		westside	</a>
</span>, then further solidified by step-up rounds from Cloud and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/5550/grubinho">
		grubinho	</a>
</span>. It wasn&#39;t enough to truly recover the half, though, as XLG reached the half up 8-4.</p>

<p>GX won the second pistol to claw back some of the deficit, and also converted their attack side bonus round by the tighest of margins.</p>

<p><em>XLG barely misses a bonus round defuse against GX.</em></p>

<p>Just as it looked like GX would tie the game with a perfect start to the second half, Rarga showed off his talent on Waylay and won 2 rounds to extend the lead. That hope and drive from GX didn&#39;t go away, as a force buy brought the map back within reach. It was a small comeback for GX, but ara closed it out 14-12 to take the series lead.</p>

<p>Next up was Ascent, with both GX and XLG running the default Ascent composition with Jett, KAY/O, and Cypher. GX got the first pistol round off a near-immaculate B site take, and despite losing the bonus conversion, they showed promise on the attack side of a very defense-sided map. XLG was able to take the lead partway through the half, with star moments from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/12365/coconut">
		coconut	</a>
</span> and NoMan, but <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/37927/happywei">
		happywei	</a>
</span> got the most satisfying moment by tucking into the god spot outside A and getting three.</p>

<p><em>happywei gets three from wine against GX.</em></p>

<p>XLG entered the half up 7-5, but GX won plenty of rounds for attack-side Ascent. That confidence was evident in their second pistol win on Ascent, with <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4181/cloud">
		Cloud	</a>
</span> securing two kills in a risky spot. GX was unable to convert the bonus, but they eventually tied the game at 9-9. Then, some amazing moments from ara and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/6959/flickless">
		Flickless	</a>
</span> helped close out the map 13-10 and the series 2-0, securing GX a spot in the Champions 2025 playoffs. </p>

<p>The player of the series was ara, the same player who entered Paris with an illness that he had to overcome, and with his performance against XLG, it was almost like it never happened. He ended the series with a 1.53 match rating, 54 kills in two maps, +23, and 13 first kills.</p>

<p>With this result, GIANTX will move on to the playoff stage of Valorant Champions 2025, while XLG are eliminated from the competition. XLG are still in VCT after <span data-ref-id="11">
