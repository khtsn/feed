Baraka of Newark, a Democratic candidate for governor who was arrested last month outside an immigration detention center, filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/trump-alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney.html" title="">Alina Habba</a>, the interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, that argues that his arrest was motivated by political malice, not justice.</p><p>The lawsuit also names Ricky Patel, a supervising agent with Homeland Security Investigations who led <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/nyregion/newark-ice-protest-arrest-ras-baraka.html" title="">the arrest of Mr. Baraka</a> on May 9 outside a 1,000-bed detention center near Newark Liberty International Airport that has become a flashpoint in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.</p><p>Mr. Baraka’s lawsuit accuses the federal authorities of false arrest and malicious prosecution. It also accuses Ms. Habba of defamation.</p><p>The suit comes as polling locations opened Tuesday for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/nyregion/new-jersey-governors-race-what-to-know.html" title="">six days of early voting</a> ahead of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/nyregion/new-jersey-democratic-candidates-for-governor.html" title="">June 10 primary</a> that has pitted Mr. Baraka against five other Democrats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last month, Ms. Habba, who was appointed by Mr. Trump to be the state’s top federal prosecutor, abruptly announced that she was dropping a trespassing charge against Mr. Baraka — a development that prompted a federal judge to publicly question the validity of the “hasty arrest” in the first place.</p><p>“Your role is not to secure convictions at all costs, nor to satisfy public clamor, nor to advance political agendas,” the judge, André M. Espinosa, said in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/23/us/mayor-baraka-judge-dismissal.html" title="">rare and harshly worded rebuke</a> of the U.S. attorney’s office that Ms. Habba leads and where he once worked as a prosecutor.</p><p>“An arrest, particularly of a public figure, is not a preliminary investigative tool,” he added. “It is a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences, and it should only be undertaken after a thorough and dispassionate evaluation of credible evidence.”</p><p>He dismissed the misdemeanor-level charge with prejudice, meaning that prosecutors could not decide to refile the same claim.</p><p>Mr. Trump tapped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/us/politics/alina-habba-trump-lawyer-counselor.html" title="">Ms. Habba, his personal lawyer</a>, to serve as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey two months after he took office for the second time, an appointment that underscored the president’s tightening grip over a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/jan-6-lawsuits.html" title="">Justice Department</a> he claimed had been weaponized against him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Spokeswomen for Ms. Habba and Mr. Patel could not be immediately reached for comment about the lawsuit. On Monday night, Ms. Habba was dismissive of the widely anticipated legal action in a social media post. “My advice to the mayor,” <a href="https://x.com/AlinaHabba/status/1929728392649114062" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she wrote</a>, “feel free to join me in prioritizing violent crime and public safety. Far better use of time for the great citizens of New Jersey.”</p><p>Mr. Baraka has said that he was intentionally targeted for arrest by Mr. Patel outside <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/nyregion/trump-deportation-facility-newark.html" title="">Delaney Hall</a>, a privately run jail that the mayor had been pressing to shut down.</p><p>Mr. Baraka has argued that the jail, which was empty for more than a year before it began holding migrants last month, does not have a valid certificate of occupancy. He had begun <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/nyregion/newark-migrants-ras-baraka-ice.html" title="">showing up daily</a> to demand that fire safety officials be permitted inside to inspect the facility. Each day, Newark officials issued tickets to the private prison company that operates it, GEO Group, which has a contract with the Trump administration worth $1 billion over 15 years.</p><p>The mayor was handcuffed on May 9 as he stood outside the jail’s gated perimeter, surrounded by three members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation.</p><p>After being allowed to wait inside the gate for nearly an hour for the federal lawmakers, who had entered the property, he was repeatedly warned that he would be placed under arrest if he did not leave, according to a criminal complaint. He then walked out the front gate to a public area where protesters had gathered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Minutes later, masked immigration agents, some carrying guns in holsters, came out from behind the gate and surrounded Mr. Baraka, who was put in handcuffs in a brief but volatile clash, according to video taken by news reporters, congressional aides and immigration activists.</p><p>Judge Espinosa ordered that he be released that night after he had been detained for about five hours at a separate U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Newark.</p><p>In the same news release in which Ms. Habba revealed that she was dropping the charges against Mr. Baraka, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/nyregion/new-jersey-congress-ice-charges.html" title="">announced assault charges</a> against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/nyregion/lamonica-mciver-newark-assault-charges.html" title="">Representative LaMonica McIver</a>, a Newark Democrat who was with Mr. Baraka the day he was arrested. The charges against Ms. McIver, who has said that she was at Delaney Hall for an authorized oversight visit and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/nyregion/new-jersey-congress-ice-mciver.html" title="">maintained her innocence</a>, are pending.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
