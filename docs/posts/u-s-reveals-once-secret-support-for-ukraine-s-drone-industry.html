But other support has largely gone on in the shadows.</p><p>That included helping Ukraine develop a new generation of drones and revolutionize how wars are fought, according to U.S. officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/magazine/drones-weapons-ukraine-war.html" title="">innovations in Ukraine’s drone industry</a> have been hailed as transformative, but the U.S. support has been less well understood. In addition to technical support, the U.S. has spent significant money, including $1.5 billion sent last September, to boost Ukraine’s drone production, officials said.</p><p>Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said the support had “a real strategic impact” on the war.</p><p>“We saw how UAVs were becoming increasingly central to the fight in Ukraine and will be central to all future fights,” Mr. Sullivan said in a statement on Thursday, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles.</p><p>The U.S. effort included money to support drone makers and to purchase parts. The United States also sent intelligence officials to Ukraine to help build its program, according to people who know about the effort.</p><p>In an interview this week, the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, referred indirectly to his agency’s support for the drone program in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I think our intelligence support has helped the Ukrainians to defend themselves,” Mr. Burns said. “Not just in the sharing of intelligence, but support for some of the systems that have been so effective.”</p><p>The White House declassified information about Russia’s plans to attack Ukraine ahead of the invasion. During the war, officials have regularly declassified information about Iranian and North Korean arms shipments to Russia.</p><p>Mr. Sullivan said the drone effort began after the Ukrainians’ first counteroffensive in the fall of 2022 as the limits of Ukraine’s conventional capabilities became clear.</p><p>The efforts accelerated, Mr. Sullivan said, in the preparation for Ukraine’s second counteroffensive. That push, in 2023, was ultimately less successful. Ukraine did not gain as much ground as it had wanted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/us/politics/us-ukraine-war-strategy.html" title="">in part because of Russia’s use of drones.</a></p><p>That 2023 counteroffensive was a hard lesson, U.S. officials said. Russian drones attacked U.S.- and European-provided tanks and armored vehicles as they tried to navigate minefields.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After the counteroffensive, U.S. officials said they rapidly increased support to Ukrainian drone makers, building on Kyiv’s efforts to grow its own industry. In addition to financial aid, the Biden administration worked to build ties between American technology companies and Ukrainian drone makers.</p><p>Last fall, the Pentagon allocated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/europe/us-ukraine-aid-long-range-drones.html" title="">$800 million to Ukraine’s drone production</a>, which was used to purchase drone components and finance drone makers. When President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House in September, President Biden said another $1.5 billion would be directed to Ukraine’s drone industry.</p><p>American officials said on Thursday that they believe the investments have made Ukraine’s drones more effective and deadly. They noted that Ukraine’s sea drones had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/world/europe/ukraine-drones-sea.html" title="">destroyed a quarter of Russia’s Black Sea fleet</a>, and that drones deployed on the front lines had helped slow Russia’s advances in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Sullivan said the drive to build Ukraine’s drone industry had provided “invaluable lessons” that the Biden administration had started to integrate into America’s own defense industry.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julian E.
