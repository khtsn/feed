    <h1>N.Y.C. Council Speaker Calls on Mayor Eric Adams to Resign</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Adrienne Adams, the speaker of the New York City Council and one of Mayor Eric Adams’s principal partners in government, said on Monday that Mr. Adams should resign.</p><p>Ms. Adams’s statement came just hours after four of Mr. Adams’s eight deputy mayors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/nyregion/adams-deputy-mayors-resign-trump-immigration.html" title="">announced</a> they would leave City Hall, blowing a devastating hole into an administration that has already been hobbled by scandal, indictment and a growing sentiment that the mayor placed his own interests ahead of those of New York City.</p><p>“With the resignation of deputy mayors, it has become clear that Mayor Adams has now lost the confidence and trust of his own staff, his colleagues in government, and New Yorkers,” Ms. Adams said in a statement. “He now must prioritize New York City and New Yorkers, step aside and resign.”</p><p>Christine Quinn, the former City Council speaker, said this was the first time she had ever heard of a speaker calling for the resignation of a mayor.</p></div></div>
