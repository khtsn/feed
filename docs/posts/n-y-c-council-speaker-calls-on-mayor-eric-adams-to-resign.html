Even before her announcement, Brad Lander, the city comptroller, expressed concern that Mr. Adams might be unable to continue running the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Lander, one of several Democrats challenging Mr. Adams’s bid for re-election in the June primary, sent a letter to Mr. Adams on Monday calling on him to create a contingency plan to run the city because of the administration’s “unprecedented leadership vacuum.”</p><p>If the mayor does not create such a plan by Friday, Mr. Lander said he would convene a committee to remove Mr. Adams on the basis of his inability to govern.</p><p>The City Charter provides for a so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-removed-from-office.html" title="">Committee of Mayoral Inability</a>, which would comprise five members: a deputy mayor chosen by the mayor; his corporation counsel; the speaker of the City Council; New York City comptroller, and the most senior of the five borough presidents. Four of the five would have to vote to remove the mayor.</p><p>As of Monday, two of those would-be members have called on Mr. Adams to resign: Ms. Adams, the council speaker, and Mr. Lander. Donovan Richards, the Queens borough president and the longest serving of the borough presidents, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>“In the absence of a contingency plan, the resignation of four or more deputy mayors, and the chaos created by the Justice Department’s actions regarding indictments against you, may well constitute inability to govern,” Mr. Lander wrote. “Should your office be unable or unwilling to formulate such a plan promptly, I will seek to convene a meeting of the Inability Committee.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Christine Quinn, the former City Council speaker, said that Ms. Adams’s statement was the first she had ever heard of a speaker calling for the resignation of a mayor, and was evidence that the leaders of the city’s executive and legislative branches were hopelessly at odds.</p><p>“Obviously, it’s an incredible vote of no confidence,” Ms. Quinn said. “But if you’re the other half of government and you’ve called on the executive to resign, there’s no ability to work together.”</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, also wields the power to remove Mr. Adams from office. She has called the allegations “extremely concerning and serious,” and was soliciting views from powerful fellow Democrats and her closest advisers.</p><p>John Kaehny, the executive director of Reinvent Albany, a good government group, said that Mr. Lander’s willingness to invoke the committee demonstrates the precariousness of the situation the city is in.</p><p>“The technocrats who are departing were put in place by Governor Hochul to stabilize the city and weed out the mayor’s cronies,” Mr. Kaehny said. “Their departure make a strong case for Governor Hochul to remove the mayor because they signaled in their resignations that the mayor was compromised.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In September, Mr. Adams was charged in a five-count federal indictment accusing him of bribery, fraud, soliciting illegal foreign campaign contributions and conspiracy.</p><p>The calls for Mr. Adams to leave office have grown louder, following the Justice Department’s order that federal prosecutors in Manhattan seek dismissal of the indictment against him — just weeks after those federal prosecutors said they had uncovered “additional criminal conduct” by the mayor.</p><p>The order was conveyed in a memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove III, who indicated that the dismissal would be only provisional; the matter could be revisited following the November mayoral election. The prospect of the case returning created the appearance that Mr. Adams would be under Mr. Trump’s thumb through the duration of his term.</p><p>That impression was only heightened when the well-regarded prosecutor that Mr. Trump had chosen as the interim U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Danielle R. Sassoon, chose to resign rather than carry out the order from Mr. Trump’s Justice Department.</p><p>The day before she resigned, Ms. Sassoon wrote an explosive letter detailing what she said appeared to be a corrupt quid pro quo between Mr. Trump and the mayor: Mr. Adams would go along with Mr. Trump’s mass deportation plans in exchange for a dismissal of his charges. She also said her office had been preparing a new indictment adding obstruction of justice to the charges against the mayor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Adams has denied any such quid-pro-quo deal exists.</p><p>At churches on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/nyregion/eric-adams-resign.html" title="">Sunday</a> and Monday, Mr. Adams said he was going nowhere. He compared himself to Lazarus, the biblical figure who rose from the dead. He appeared to suggest that he was the victim of a smear campaign, and said that if you <a href="https://x.com/jacobkornbluh/status/1891580147926528302" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tell</a> a lie long enough, people will tend to believe it, a phenomenon he compared to <a href="https://x.com/courtneycgross/status/1891562895844036982" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“a modern-day Mein Kampf</a>.”</p><p>His comments incited more uproar, with Scott Stringer, a former city comptroller who is also running for mayor, calling Mr. Adams’s comments “unacceptable.”</p><p>“The mayor of the city with the largest Jewish population should not be comparing the situation that his own unethical conduct put him into anything to do with Hitler or the Holocaust,” he said.</p><p>William K.
