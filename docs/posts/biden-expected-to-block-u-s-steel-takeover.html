Yellen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The $15 billion deal, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/business/us-steel-nippon-steel-deal.html" title="">announced this past December</a>, has attracted scrutiny from the Biden administration and several lawmakers, who have questioned the prospect of a critical U.S. steel producer being sold to a foreign owner. They have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/07/us/politics/us-steel-japan-acquisition-biden.html" title="">warned</a> that a foreign owner could be more likely to move U.S. Steel jobs and production overseas. The Steelworkers Union had vigorously opposed the deal, and its prospects were seen as pivotal in Pennsylvania, a key swing state in the presidential election.</p><p>President Biden said in the spring that U.S. Steel should remain American owned, and former President Donald J. Trump had also said he would block the sale. Over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris also said the industrial icon should remain American-owned.</p><p>Shares of U.S. Steel dropped 23 percent on Wednesday after The Washington Post and The Financial Times initially reported the expected move.</p><p>A spokesman for Nippon Steel declined to comment. A spokesman for U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Employees of U.S. Steel who were in favor of the deal held a rally at its headquarters on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Today’s rally is about displaying support for the transaction with Nippon Steel,” David B. Burritt, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We want elected leaders and other key decision makers to recognize the benefits of the deal as well as the unavoidable consequences if the deal fails.”</p><p>Legal experts who specialize in international mergers and acquisitions said that a block of such a deal appeared to be overtly political and could damage America’s reputation for having open markets.</p><p>“The U.S. will lose all standing to argue that F.D.I. screening regimes around the world should not be politicized,” said John Kabealo, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in cross-border transactions.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
