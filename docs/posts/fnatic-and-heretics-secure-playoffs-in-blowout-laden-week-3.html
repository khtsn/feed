    <h1>FNATIC and Heretics secure playoffs in blowout-laden week 3</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>Week 3 of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2380/champions-tour-2025-emea-stage-1" target="_blank">EMEA Stage 1</a> was full of playoff clinches, blowouts, and even a historic achievement. With all 12 teams back in action vying for three spots in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/champions-tour-2025-masters-toronto" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>, only one of the region&#39;s six matches this week went the full three maps, while it also saw VCT&#39;s first 13-0 of the year.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an overview of the week&#39;s six games:</p>



<p>After splitting its first two games of the stage, BBL Esports secured a smooth 2-0 victory over KOI. The result knocked KOI down to a 0-3 start, distancing them from Group Omega&#39;s top four.</p>

<p>Natus Vincere also defeated GIANTX 2-1 to send them to 0-3, but the story of the match was the finishing map. NAVI, backed by an absurd 22/2 stat line from <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29867/hiro">
		hiro	</a>
</span>, shut out GIANTX, shutting them out 13-0. The shutout was VCT&#39;s second in 2025, and EMEA&#39;s first since 2022, when <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/79077/fnatic-vs-funplus-phoenix-champions-tour-stage-1-emea-challengers-ubf" target="_blank">FPX shut out FNATIC on Split</a>. With the win, <span data-ref-id="13">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="14">

</span> join an exclusive group of players to have two 13-0 wins.</p>

<p>The theme of blowouts continued on the next day, when Team Liquid came close to doubling the number of 13-0 wins against FUT Esports. On Lotus, FUT&#39;s map pick, Liquid dominated 13-1 while Duelist <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/14681/kamo">
		kamo	</a>
</span> put on one of the best Waylay performances yet. He went 23/7 with a 2.22 rating, and while the second map of the series was not nearly as dominant, kamo continued his hot shot to help Liquid to a 2-0 victory. FUT Duelist <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/12793/xeus">
		xeus	</a>
</span>, who entered the week as the world&#39;s leading fragger, struggled in this series. The result positions Liquid, BBL, and FUT at the top of Group Omega, with all three teams possessing a 2-1 record.</p>

<p>In a match that had all the makings of a big one between two powerhouses, Team Heretics downed Team Vitality 2-0. The match saw Heretics return to its double Duelist comp on the first map, Haven, which saw flex player <span data-ref-id="17">

</span> join <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/18350/miniboo">
		MiniBoo	</a>
</span> at the tip of the fragging spear. The pair combined for 42 kills on the map and fought back from an early 5-1 deficit to secure their map pick at 13-10. It was the MiniBoo and Wo0t show again on Icebox, as the pair combined for 42 kills again to move Heretics to 3-0 and secure the region&#39;s first playoff spot. </p>


<p><em>Ridiculous triple kill from <span data-ref-id="19">

</span>.</em></p>

<p>The very next day, FNATIC claimed EMEA&#39;s second playoff spot with a 2-0 win over Apeks, though it wasn&#39;t quite easy the whole way through. After stealing away Apeks&#39; map pick of Lotus 13-5, FNATIC&#39;s trend of long matches on Split continued. They nearly saw an 11-8 advantage slip away, but forced overtime. The attacking side of the map was more successful for both teams, meaning one defender-sided win should have been enough to tip the scales. Sure enough, after trading two series of attacking rounds, a win on defense earned FNATIC a 16-14 win â€” yet another overtime victory on Split. FNATIC moved to 3-0 and secured playoffs, while Apeks fell to 0-3.</p>

<p>In a French derby of sorts, Gentle Mates and Karmine Corp went head to head. Both teams held records of 1-1, and with three teams in Group Omega already sitting at 2-1, a win in this match could have big implications in the event of future tiebreakers. While Gentle Mates started Haven dominantly, Karmine Corp responded. After going down 9-5, <span data-ref-id="20">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10307/marteen">

</span> helped KC to a 12-9 lead, which would be met with Gentle Mates forcing overtime. KC took care of business in overtime, winning 14-12 to move the series to Pearl. Despite a lengthy tech pause halting the start of the second map, Karmine Corp was pedal to the metal to start the second map, pushing aside Gentle Mates 13-2 to win and move to 2-1.</p>
