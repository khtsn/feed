The president, who was not yet 30 when he first won a Senate seat in 1972, cracked that he went on to serve for “374 years.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Earlier in the week, Mr. Biden appeared unbothered about alienating conservatives when he attacked Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — in the Republican’s home state — for not voting for the Inflation Reduction Act, the president’s signature legislation.</p><p>And on Monday in Pittsburgh, during an event with Ms. Harris, Mr. Biden did not seem particularly keen to cede the spotlight. He spoke eight minutes longer than the vice president, even as he said he would be “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/us/politics/harris-walz-michigan-pennsylvania.html" title="">on the sidelines</a>” going forward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Signs of appreciation for Mr. Biden at the Democratic National Convention last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It’s complicated because this is not the September he had planned,” said David Axelrod, a former senior aide to former President Barack Obama. He described the president as relaxed, candid and — to borrow a term from Ms. Harris’s allies — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-president-debate.html" title="">unburdened</a>.</p><p>“He’s not doing much ‘Well, I shouldn’t say that’ anymore,” Mr. Axelrod said. “And that’s probably good.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Harris campaign is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/us/politics/harris-biden-campaign-strategy.html" title="">deploying Mr. Biden</a> in a targeted way — mostly to the swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where he still appeals to white, working-class voters and union members.</p><p>But Ms. Harris will try to forge her own political identity.</p><p>Last month, in their first joint public appearance since Mr. Biden dropped out of the race, Ms. Harris was clearly the main figure during a health care event in Largo, Md.</p><p>She was the one who thanked all the elected officials by name. She was the one who set the tone for the event. While she spoke, he stood quietly to the side, his hands clasped in front of him, almost as if he were the vice president again. It was a role he played for eight years under Mr. Obama, but one he thought was behind him.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s allies emphasize that he is still the president, and that he is still navigating crises both at home and abroad, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. In blunt terms, he told reporters on Monday that he did not think Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was doing enough to bring home hostages.</p><p>Three days later, he accused Republicans of failing to address gun violence after two students and two teachers were shot and killed in the deadliest episode of school violence in Georgia history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We need more than thoughts and prayers,” Mr. Biden said. “Some of my Republican friends in Congress just finally have to say: ‘Enough is enough. We have to do something.’”</p><p>And while the pressures of the campaign may have relented, Mr. Biden is still facing personal difficulty as his son, Hunter, faces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/us/politics/hunter-biden-tax-trial.html" title="">the possibility of time behind bars</a> in a federal tax case.</p><p>Mr. Biden has spent much of his time on the trail burnishing his own legacy and dipping into the past, nothing new for a president known to embrace storytelling. (He often adds an emphatic “Not a joke!” in the middle of a tale.)</p><p>But now, in the final months of his presidency, Mr. Biden appears to be looking back a bit more than usual. This week, he described the joy he felt during his first Senate race when a steelworker named Hughie endorsed him. He told stories about his great-grandfather working in mining in Pennsylvania. He shouted out his friends in the Senate, reminding voters that he grew up in the same neighborhood as Bob Casey of Pennsylvania.</p><p>“The literal weight of the world is not solely on his shoulders,” said Quentin James, an ally of Mr. Biden and a co-founder of the Collective PAC, which aims to rally Black voters. “I think he is able to be unfiltered. To be relaxed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Friday, he took a particularly unfiltered tone toward former President Donald J. Trump, the person he felt duty bound to keep out of the White House.</p><p>Choking up as he remembered his son, Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of brain cancer, Mr. Biden said he was enraged by comments attributed to Mr. Trump, that American soldiers killed in combat were “losers” and “suckers.”</p><p>“I mean this from the bottom of my heart, I’m glad I wasn’t there,” Mr. Biden said. “I think I would’ve done something.”</p><p>Peter Baker<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
