Energy is “a strategic asset to strengthen our allies” and “a national security attribute,” Mr. Pyatt said, referring in no uncertain terms to fossil fuels. If confirmed as Secretary of State, Mr. Rubio would choose Mr. Pyatt’s replacement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Pyatt noted that U.S. crude oil production is 70 percent higher than it was 8 years ago and that U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, which went from near-zero in 2016 to now dominating the global market, are set to double over the course of Mr. Trump’s upcoming term. “The U.S. is an energy giant,” he said. “We are energy secure in a way we’ve never been before. We have no dependence remaining on the Middle East from an energy standpoint, which is quite different than where we were a decade or two ago.”</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Under Mr. Biden’s administration, the United States is currently <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">producing more oil than any nation at any time in history</a>. It is also the world’s largest producer of gas, and its leading exporter. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Pyatt, a former ambassador to Ukraine and Greece, spearheaded U.S. efforts to wean Europe from Russian fuels by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/climate/greece-europe-natural-gas-lng.html" title="">replacing them with U.S. gas</a>, liquefied and shipped from the Gulf Coast across the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Mr. Pyatt also noted that, in congratulatory calls from Europe and Japan that Mr. Trump received upon winning re-election, there was unsurprising reaffirmation of gas’s key role in trade and mutual security.</p><p>The Biden administration’s pause on approving new applications for gas export terminals will almost certainly be reversed by Mr. Trump, but experts said the original move had little bearing on U.S. dominance of the global gas market and any efforts Mr. Trump may make to further increase exports would be met with the reality of uncertain long-term growth in the market as the price of renewables continues to drop around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Generally speaking, I think we’re likely to see changes in policy but continuity in energy-market outcomes,” said Jason Bordoff, who leads the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.</p><p>The main difference may well be, Mr. Bordoff said, that the Biden administration couched its energy policies in terms of emissions reduction and climate change, and the Trump administration will more publicly and explicitly allude to gas prices and national security, even if the latter clearly underpinned Mr. Biden’s policies, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Even if Mr. Trump manages to slow growth in the U.S. domestic market for electric vehicles, for instance, he will still be compelled by a fear shared by the Biden administration over China’s dominance in battery supply chains “at a time of growing demand for power for artificial intelligence and data centers,” Mr. Bordoff said.</p><p>China currently controls most of the global supply chain for clean energy technologies. More than 90 percent of rare earth mineral processing happens there, as well as more than three-quarters of all battery cell production. Most components of solar and wind power are also dominated by China, though provisions in Mr. Biden’s signature climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, have accelerated U.S. production of late.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>American investments in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/climate/kobold-zambia-copper-ai-mining.html" title="">battery supply chains and mineral extraction in Africa</a> and elsewhere will almost certainly remain in place and may grow, experts say. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, which has led efforts to counter China’s control of that sector, was founded by the first Trump administration.</p><p>Trump’s new team will have to “figure out what are the sectors which are probably so far gone that we’re never going to catch up,” said Mr. Pyatt, who questioned the wisdom of politicizing electric vehicles when the rest of the world has already “cast the die” on committing to transitioning away from fossil fuels.</p><p>“The rest of the world is going to keep going and I think our companies that are globally active have figured that out,” Mr. Pyatt said, adding that he hoped those same companies would be bold enough to tell Mr. Trump, “‘Hey, we shouldn’t be walking away from this stuff because this is how we’re going to make money in the future.’”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Max Bearak is a Times reporter who writes about global energy and climate policies and new approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/max-bearak">More about Max Bearak</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/energy-department-us">Energy Department, U.S.</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/state-department">State Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Climate and the Environment</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Climate F.A.Q.:</strong> Do you have questions about climate change? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/climate-change-faq.html">We’ve got answers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Hottest Year in Recorded History:</strong> 2024 brought the world to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/09/climate/2024-heat-record-climate-goal.html">a dangerous warming threshold</a>, raising questions about how much nations can stop the planet from heating up further.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Dangerous New Era:</strong> Extreme weather events, like the firestorms ravaging Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/climate/california-fires-climate-change-disasters.html">are the consequences of a warming planet</a>, scientists say.</p></li><li><p><strong>The New Climate Gold Rush: </strong>Investors are betting that they can make a dent in global warming, and healthy profits, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/climate/carbon-capture-global-warming.html">companies that strip carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask NYT Climate</strong><strong>:</strong> Are smart thermostats worth the money?
