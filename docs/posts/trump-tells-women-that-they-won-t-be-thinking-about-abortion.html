    <h1>Trump Tells Women That They Won’t ‘Be Thinking About Abortion’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Trump, who last year was found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/nyregion/trump-defamation-trial-carroll-verdict.html" title="">liable of sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll</a> and who has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html" title="">history of making demeaning remarks about women</a>, has been seeking to cast himself as a safeguard for women, posting similar comments on his social-media platform.</p><p>“Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free,” he said during an extended riff at the rally.</p><p>And then he asserted: “You will no longer be thinking about abortion.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Harris campaign, Sarafina Chitika, said that “women know better.”</p><p>“He tries to tell us what to think and what we care about,” Ms. Chitika said. “We will vote like our lives depend on it this November.”</p><p>The former president has frequently bragged about his role in appointing Supreme Court justices who helped to overturn Roe v. Wade. On Monday night, he repeated that the court’s ruling returned authority to the states to determine their own limits on abortion, a move that he said that many Americans had favored for decades.</p><p>“Everyone wanted abortion out of the federal government and into the states,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump also repeated a falsehood that he amplified during his debate against Ms. Harris earlier this month, saying that Democrats had been demanding abortions in the ninth month of a pregnancy or “an execution of a baby after birth.”</p></div></div>
