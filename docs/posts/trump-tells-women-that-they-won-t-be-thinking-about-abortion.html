Wade. On Monday night, he repeated that the court’s ruling returned authority to the states to determine their own limits on abortion, a move that he said that many Americans had favored for decades.</p><p>“Everyone wanted abortion out of the federal government and into the states,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump also repeated a falsehood that he amplified during his debate against Ms. Harris earlier this month, saying that Democrats had been demanding abortions in the ninth month of a pregnancy or “an execution of a baby after birth.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A growing share of voters in swing states now say the issue is central to their decision this fall, according to New York Times/Siena College <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/10/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">polls</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/17/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">earlier this month</a>.</p><p>During the midterm elections in 2022, the first political cycle after the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v.
