    <h1>Charter Company in Fatal Helicopter Crash Had Prior Mechanical Failures</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the 2013 incident, a family of four tourists from Sweden was taking a sightseeing tour on a Sunday morning in a red Bell 206 that took off from a heliport near Wall Street. As the helicopter began to descend over the water, the pilot inflated pontoons that kept the aircraft upright in the water. The passengers went to a hospital but nobody was seriously injured.</p><p>Michael Roth, the chief executive of New York Helicopter Charter, has been operating sightseeing flights in and around the city for 30 years. Reached on Thursday after the fatal crash, Mr. Roth confirmed that the helicopter that went down had been leased by his company from its Louisiana-based owner.</p><p>He said that he could not explain what had happened on the flight. “I have no information whatsoever,” he said by phone from New Jersey. “I’m not there.”</p><p>He added that as a father and grandfather, he was “devastated” by the tragic outcome.</p><p>Court records suggest that New York Helicopter Charter was recently facing financial difficulties. One of its helicopters was repossessed in December after the company failed to pay the lease, according to a lawsuit filed in January in federal court in Manhattan by PHI Aviation, a Louisiana-based company that said it was owed $1.4 million. And New York Helicopter Charter filed for bankruptcy in 2019, saying that its business had been harmed by changes in New York City policies on air traffic around the city.</p><p>Operators like New York Helicopter Charter have been limited for several years by an agreement they made with city officials amid widespread <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/nyregion/helicopter-tours-noise-air-pollution.html" title="">complaints about noise</a> from their frequent, low flights over the city. To avoid being banned from the city-owned heliport near Wall Street, the companies agreed to stick to prescribed routes and not to fly on Sundays.</p></div></div>
