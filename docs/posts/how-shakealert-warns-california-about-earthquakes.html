Protect yourself” — were created with a tool from the United States Geological Survey known as <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-i-sign-shakealertr-earthquake-early-warning-system" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ShakeAlert</a>. The system detects earthquakes as soon as they start happening and quickly gathers information to determine which areas are likely to experience strong shaking. ShakeAlert operates on the notion that each and every fraction of a second is precious time that people can use to react and avoid injury before shaking from an earthquake occurs.</p><p>Here’s how the system works:</p><h2 id="link-201e0931">Picture a small car six feet underground.</h2><p>The ShakeAlert early warning system monitors for earthquakes across the West Coast with the help of tens of thousands of seismic stations, each the size of a compact car and buried about six feet underground. The stations are equipped with sensors that detect the full spectrum of seismic waves, the vibrations that travel through the Earth and toward the surface after an earthquake, similar to the way ripples radiate across water when a pebble is dropped into a lake.</p><p>The waves travel at different speeds, and the success of the system is built on this. The fast-moving primary waves, or P-waves, travel at about four miles per second; they are gentler and less likely to cause destruction. The stronger secondary waves, or S-waves, move much more slowly, about two and a half miles per second. They are more likely to cause damage in an earthquake.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The goal of ShakeAlert is to capture the P-wave data, process it on the U.S.G.S.’s high-speed computers and make it available to government agencies and private companies like apps that send out alerts before the S-waves hit the surface.</p><p>“It’s all automated, and it’s all happening really fast,” said Robert de Groot, a physical scientist at the agency and a coordinator for ShakeAlert.</p><h2 id="link-f53722d">The closer you are, the less notice you’ll get.</h2><p>California gets a lot of earthquakes, many of which cause little or no damage. The alerts go out for only the strongest: when a quake’s strength is estimated to be magnitude-4.5 and above. Separately, shaking generated from an earthquake is measured on a scale from 1 to 10, and if the shaking in an area is estimated to be level 3 or higher, an alert is sent.</p><p>The closer you are to the epicenter, the less likely you are to get a warning before the strongest shaking arrives — because people living near the quake are going to feel seismic waves as soon as the system starts processing the data.</p><p>On Monday, people in downtown San Diego received alerts about one or two seconds before the shaking, Mr. de Groot said. People in Los Angeles got messages up to about 10 seconds early.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Distance matters,” Mr. de Groot said. “For people farther away from the earthquake, they had a lot of time before the earthquake.”</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="14wea-quake-embed-map-southern-california-nytezzej" data-id="100000010109773" data-source-id="100000010109773"><div slug="14wea-quake-embed-map-southern-california-nytezzej" data-sourceid="100000010109773" id="embed-id-100000010109773">

(Mr. de Groot said that the program could expand to Alaska when funding allows.)</p><p><a href="https://myshake.berkeley.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The MyShake app</a>, which you can download onto your phone, uses data from ShakeAlert to send out early earthquake warnings. <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/wireless-emergency-alerts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wireless Emergency Alerts</a> (the same technology used to send Amber alerts), which most people receive thanks to a default setting on phones, also delivers early earthquake warning messages.

He said he and wife were in their bedroom on their computers when they both received the alert telling them to drop and cover. When he finished reading the message, he said, the earthquake was there.</p><p>“I’m trying to figure out if this is a good thing or a bad thing,” Mr. Kimmel joked.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Graff is a Times reporter covering weather, wildfires and earthquakes.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
