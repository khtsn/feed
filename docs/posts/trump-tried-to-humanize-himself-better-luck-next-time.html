Mr. Trump needs votes from women, and the Arlington and abortion story lines aren’t exactly winners in that regard. So it was interesting to watch him working to firm up a part of his base, at the third annual convention of Moms for Liberty, a conservative group devoted to “parental rights.” He took a stab at addressing the Arlington mess, telling his cleaned-up version of events and whining about how persecuted he is. But mostly, he tried to offer what he<em> </em>thinks women want — Trump unfiltered. Which is, in his head, the ultimate winning strategy.</p><p>No doubt, everyone was in a partying mood. Everywhere you looked, there were women rocking Trump T-shirts and cocktail dresses, cowboy boots and stilettos, ponytails and MAGA hats. But Mr. Trump’s appearance raised the same question as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint/north-carolina-election-battleground?smid=url-share" title="">his recent string of North Carolina rallies</a>: If he’s spending time in safe spaces and once-safe states, when will he start trying to win over on-the-fence women and others who may decide the election?</p><p>Forgoing his usual rallies, the former president had agreed to a special “fireside chat” with Moms for Liberty. To signal how cozy and Oprah-esque this was going to be, a vase of red roses sat on a small table beside his large white armchair and the one occupied by Tiffany Justice, a co-founder of the group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Before the event, Ms. Justice shared with me her hopes for the encounter. She wanted Mr. Trump to talk parental rights, of course, but she also wanted folks to see a softer side of him: “He’s a dad. He’s a grandfather. He loves his family. We’ve seen him working with his family in politics and business, right? I hope the American people get to know Donald Trump in a little bit of a different way. He’ll get to express his love for his family. I think that’s going to resonate with American voters.”</p><p>In theory, this was a brilliant opportunity for Team Trump, which is desperate to humanize the candidate and get him to talk policy rather than simply slag his political enemies.</p><p>In practice, the evening kept veering off course precisely as you’d expect.</p><p>Ms. Justice pitched plenty of softballs. Asserting that it was “obvious” Mr. Trump loves “being a father and grandfather,” she invited him to share why he continues ”to choose to work with your children in business and politics.”</p><p>Great time to talk about legacy or family bonds or what a crackerjack attack dog Don Jr. is, right? Wrong!</p><p>“I’ve always liked it. I don’t think that I’ll be doing it very much politically,” he says, noting how “unfair” it has been to the kids. Especially Ivanka. “Great student. Beautiful girl.” But everyone was mean to her when she was in the White House. She even gave up her superprofitable women’s wear line! And it’s not as though she wanted to be the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/31/donald-trump-at-moms-for-liberty-says-ivanka-hired-millions-of-people" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“United Nations secretary” or ambassador</a> — which he said he wanted her to do. But according to him, she said, “Daddy, I don’t want to do that. I just want to help people get jobs.” He rambled on about how she hired “millions of people during the course of her stay,” before grumpily concluding, “Nothing ever good. It was just very tough.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Justice also invited Mr. Trump to talk about his mother.</p><p>“She was obviously a very strong woman. Was she hard on you with school?” she asked.</p><p>“No, she wasn’t,” said Mr. Trump. “I had a great mother, a great father.”</p><p>“Very different people,” he added, but they had a “great” marriage that lasted more than 60 years. “I said, Pop, I’m not going to be able to beat you with that,” he said, laughing.</p><p>One might assume that at a Moms for Liberty love-in, Mr. Trump would at least pay extra attention to parental rights. One would be mistaken. Now, to be fair, that phrase has become a bloated term applied to pretty much anything that happens around a school that conservatives dislike, from vaccine mandates to discussions of race to a book about the sexuality of sea horses. One member from California told me she had so far gotten 20 books pulled from the schools in her district.</p><p>But these days, trans issues are what really juice the faithful, and Mr. Trump nodded to that a few times. Asked about the power of the presidency to combat wokeness — “Well, you can do everything!” he crowed — he noted how “incredible” it is that “your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation.” Um, what? That said, he spent most of his time on the topic talking about Olympic athletes who had “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/18/8055691/transgender-transgendered-tnr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transgendered</a>” — spending extra energy smearing that Algerian boxer, who does not, in fact, identify as trans.</p><p>Details. Shmetails.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Trump went on a disjointed reminiscence about the many presidential debates he had participated in, culminating with the infamous face-off with President Biden this past June. “How did he do? He was sharp as a tack,” cracked the former president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Quick as a bunny, Ms. Justice jumped in to head off his extended mockery. Many Americans know the pain of watching “as their family members have aged and experienced dementia,” she observed, heaping praise on Mr. Trump for handling the awkward moment with “such grace.”</p><p>Clearly at a loss, Mr. Trump babbled that he had been “surprised by a lot of things” and recalled that he had looked at Mr. Biden “for a brief moment” — which he hadn’t wanted to do, mind you, because he’s “angry at him” for doing such a “horrible job.” Then he was off and ranting about the awfulness of Kamala Harris and how unfair it is that, after spending so much time and money attacking Mr. Biden, he had to shift to her. “Turned out she didn’t work at McDonald’s!” he griped. (I’ll let you look up that faux outrage yourself.)</p><p>Now, Ms. Justice is no shrinking violet. During our talk, she dismissed and dodged any questions she disliked — such as her concerns about JD Vance’s penchant for insulting women — or tried to divert us onto more comfortable ground. Asked about the gender gap in the presidential race, she claimed not to understand what I meant. Then, as I started to explain, she interrupted: “So you mean ‘sex.’ Because there’s no such thing as gender,” she quipped, looking to draw me into a back-and-forth on gender identity rather than Mr. Trump’s lousy electoral track record with women.</p><p>It will surprise no one that in Ms. Justice’s tête-à-tête with Mr. Trump, the topic of abortion was avoided like … well, like the former president’s mention of any of his kids not named Ivanka.</p><p>Still, there was little Ms. Justice could do to keep Mr. Trump on track. Not that it mattered to anyone in the room. At evening’s end, the crowd inching toward the escalators was buzzing, and I chatted with some women thrilled simply to have been in the same room with their idol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But as for the rest of America — all those women and men not already sold on the MAGA king — it’s hard to imagine they saw much of anything different in his fireside chattiness. At least not in a reassuring or humanizing direction.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
