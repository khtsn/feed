Earlier in the day, an Israeli airstrike also targeted radars in Deir al-Zour’s military airport in the country’s east, the Observatory <a href="https://www.syriahr.com/%d9%87%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b9%d9%80-%d9%80%d9%86%d9%80-%d9%80%d9%81-%d9%85%d9%86%d8%b0-%d8%a8%d8%af%d8%a1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b6%d8%b1%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d9%81%d9%8a-2012-%d8%ba%d8%a7%d8%b1/741100/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>The “successive strikes” along the Syrian coast — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/russia-syria-assad.html" title="">home to Russian naval bases</a> — amounted to “the most violent strikes in the area” since 2012, according to the Observatory. It said there were 18 airstrikes, which were particularly powerful because they were consecutive and detonated missiles in warehouses, leading to secondary explosions.</p><p>The Israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. Israeli officials have previously said that the campaign in Syria is an effort to keep military equipment out of the hands of “extremists,” after an alliance of rebel groups ousted the Assad regime earlier this month.

Hermon.

The move was necessary, the prime minister’s office said, because a “new front” had opened up on Israel’s border with Syria after the fall of the Assad government.</p><p>Israel seized the Golan Heights during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and it is considered illegally occupied under international law.</p><p>The head of the group leading the rebel coalition that now governs Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, said in an interview on Saturday with Syria TV, a pro-opposition channel, that Israel was using pretexts to justify “unwarranted” territorial seizures in Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, he said, Syria could not afford any further conflict and was instead focused on diplomatic solutions.</p><p>“Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations,” Mr. al-Shara said. “The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction.”</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Vivian Yee<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Syria’s Civil War: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Syria’s New Leadership:</strong> After overthrowing the longtime Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, the rebel alliance that took power in Syria was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-alliance.html">making rapid progress toward international legitimacy</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli Strikes:</strong> Israel carried out a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/syria-israel-strikes.html">heavy wave of airstrikes on Syria’s coastal region</a>, a war monitor said, as the Israeli military continued to pound Syria in a bid to destroy the country’s military assets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Returning Home:</strong> Elated residents of Tel Rifaat, Syria, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-stronghold-return.html">trickling home to their shattered town</a>, a rebel stronghold controlled until recently by the government.</p></li><li><p><strong>America’s Kurdish Allies:</strong> For more than a decade, Syria’s Kurdish fighters have helped the United States contain the Islamic State. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/kurdish-forces-syria-turkey-isis-america.html">Now they fear a resurgent Turkey</a> that has long considered them an adversary.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Contact With Rebels:</strong> Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/middleeast/blinken-jordan-syria-transition.html">communicating directly with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, the dominant rebel faction, despite its designation as a terrorist group.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
