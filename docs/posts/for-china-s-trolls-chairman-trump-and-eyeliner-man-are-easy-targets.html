data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Chinese are trolling the Trump administration.</p><p>A YouTuber who used to make parody music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi6nBgUBwlY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videos</a> about the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, produced “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJnd3EXeY30" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Song of MAGA</a>,” a satire of President Trump’s vision for the United States.</p><p>A nationalistic TikToker who whitewashes China’s persecution of Uyghurs in Xinjiang made a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wuyue_sky/video/7493584036183461150?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> mocking Vice President JD Vance’s purported use of eyeliner in full drag fashion while demanding an apology for a comment Mr. Vance had made about “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/jd-vance-peasants-china.html" title="">Chinese peasants</a>.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/67e8d8e8000000000903bfcc?app_platform=ios&amp;app_version=8.79&amp;share_from_user_hidden=true&amp;xsec_source=app_share&amp;type=video&amp;xsec_token=CBDZh6dr8HNM9GwyXk8Y8QYFY6083BDIaYOC26S4D0Uek=&amp;author_share=1&amp;xhsshare=CopyLink&amp;shareRedId=ODY1REdHSUs2NzUyOTgwNjY0OThHNz9B&amp;apptime=1745209587&amp;share_id=3f1ecd86898f46c086e81646374576eb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on the social media platform RedNote, a video of Mr. Trump admiring a portrait of himself at the Justice Department is accompanied with a North Korean song, “The Whole World Envies Us,” likening him to the dictator Kim Il-sung.</p><p>United by their disdain for the Trump administration, Chinese internet users of different political views have created an impressive collection of work. The images, videos and music, mostly generated by artificial intelligence, mock the American leaders for what the Chinese believe are ridiculous and outrageous policies and remarks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The trolling reflects shifting perceptions of the United States in China. The Trump administration has provided rich material for the Communist Party propagandists — it has never been easier for Beijing to stand on a moral high ground. The more liberal-minded Chinese, having overcome the initial <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/business/china-donald-trump-cultural-revolution.html" title="">shock</a> at actions that reminded them of their own authoritarian government, are applying their creativity to Washington.</p><p>“I love the United States, but Trump has damaged American democracy and freedom, and harmed the country’s image on the international stage,” the creator of “The Song of MAGA” wrote in a text message.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The A.I.-generated music video, based on a famous 1960s revolutionary song, “We March on the Great Road,” opens with characters resembling Mr. Trump, Mr. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk holding little red books in front of a large red banner that says, “SERVE THE PEOPLE.”</p><p>The lyric goes:</p><p><em>We march on the broad highway</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the video, the four men were depicted marching in the fashion of the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. The characters assembled iPhones, rode in scooters like Chinese blue-collar workers and picked tomatoes like Chinese farmers under the scorching sun.</p><p>The video’s creator, who declined to disclose their identity to me for fear of retribution, assigned the four characters modest jobs that millions of Chinese have to scrape by. Mr. Trump’s character is a cobbler. Mr. Rubio’s is a street vendor selling steamed buns. Mr. Vance’s sells produce. Mr. Musk’s works on construction sites and, sitting on the curb, sells socks and toys.</p><p>Mr. Vance has attracted the most brutal trolling. His “peasants” comment offended many Chinese. In a widely shared A.I.-generated <a href="https://weibo.com/7010131150/5156206277034199" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>, a character resembling Mr. Vance, in a pink jacket, pink nails and hot pink lipstick, applies eyeliner while saying in a promotional female tone, “Sis, hillbilly brand eyeliner, made in China, reliable quality.”</p><p>Another video shows a cartoon character saying: “Vice President Vance, I’m a Chinese peasant. Do you realize your tariff policy will lead to the soaring price of your eyeliner?”</p><p>There are so many posts about the topic that Mr. Vance is now known as “the eyeliner man” on the Chinese internet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump is mocked for expecting a call from Mr. Xi, who’s ghosting him, to make a trade deal. In a widely shared A.I.-generated image, a character that looks like Mr. Trump lies on a pink bed in a pastel-colored children’s bedroom. With his face resting on his hands, he stares at a smartphone. Behind him on the wall is a large portrait of Mr. Xi, smiling.</p><p>“Hahahaha, who’s going to call after a breakup?” commented a Weibo user with an internet address in the northwestern province of Gansu. “Trump, do you think you’re filming a soap opera?”</p><p>There are reasons the Chinese are mocking the four men. President Trump imposed 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods. Mr. Vance called the Chinese people “peasants.” Mr. Rubio is (or was) a well-known China hawk. Mr. Musk parlayed his influence with Mr. Trump into an official role leading budget cuts at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/media/china-voice-of-america-radio-free-asia.html" title="">Voice of America</a> and Radio Free Asia, whose programs influenced generations of Chinese. (On Tuesday, a federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/judge-trump-voice-of-america.html" title="">blocked</a> the administration from dismantling the broadcast channels, and Mr. Musk said he would cut back his government work to spend more time with his electric car company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html" title="">Tesla</a>.)</p><p>The four men are prime for ridicule because people there face fewer censorship restrictions for mocking foreign leaders than their own. It reminds me of the Soviet <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP89G00720R000800040003-6.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joke</a> that an American said he could stand in front of the White House and yell, “To hell with Ronald Reagan,” to which a Russian replied: “That’s nothing. I can stand in front of the Kremlin and yell, ‘To hell with Ronald Reagan,’ too.”</p><p>The censors seem to be reining in the trolling. When I tried to share with a small WeChat group an image of Mr. Trump, Mr. Vance and Mr. Musk working on a Nike assembly line, it failed to go through. Links to some of the images and videos I saved no longer work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>China’s strict censorship rules have helped the country’s internet users hone their trolling expertise. It takes skill to simultaneously express views the Communist Party forbids while evading the censors.</p><p>Mr. Xi has been a favorite target. His nicknames include Winnie the Pooh, for his physical resemblance to the plump cartoon character; “Baozi,” or bun, for his publicity stunt visit to a bun restaurant early in his rule; and “Mao II,” for his revival of some Maoist ideologies.</p><p>The national censor banned more than <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/%E5%9B%BD%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%9E%E4%B9%A0%E8%BF%91%E5%B9%B3%E6%95%8F%E6%84%9F%E8%AF%8D%E5%BA%93" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">35,000</a> sensitive words and combinations of words related to Mr. Xi in 2016, according to China Digital Times, a media outlet focusing on censorship. In less than three months in 2020, RedNote, the social media platform, compiled a list of 564 new sensitive words referring to Mr. Xi.</p><p>It’s a lot safer to mock Mr. Trump.</p><p>A video blogger named Chen Rui has become a national phenomenon for his spot-on Trump impersonations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>From his furrowed eyebrows, pursed lips and tilted head, to the way he opens and closes his arms while speaking, and his intonation and English accent, Mr. Chen is top rate. He is known as the Chinese Trump.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He gained some international fame after appearing in a recent livestreaming session with the YouTube influencer IShowSpeed from Chongqing, Mr. Chen’s hometown in southwestern China. He told IShowSpeed, whose name is Darren Watkins Jr., that he would love to visit America one day.</p><p>Mr. Chen, whose online alias is Rui Ge, has a wide following on social media platforms and doesn’t talk about Chinese politics in his videos — he likes to show off <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/67e5297a000000001201e6cb?app_platform=ios&amp;app_version=8.79&amp;share_from_user_hidden=true&amp;xsec_source=app_share&amp;type=video&amp;xsec_token=CB6U8mXFsoumqOoYXSUr81-WNXyW0yCAOuR6Ex-4_oZfo=&amp;author_share=1&amp;xhsshare=CopyLink&amp;shareRedId=ODY1REdHSUs2NzUyOTgwNjY0OThHNz9B&amp;apptime=1745280126&amp;share_id=44a5fd3e417547cf88da2d8e61efef8b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chongqing</a> and seems to enjoy making food videos. But he frequently incorporates well-known Trump expressions, such as “You have no cards” and “You haven’t said ‘thank you.’”</p><p>In one <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/67cb11d0000000000b017105?app_platform=ios&amp;app_version=8.79&amp;share_from_user_hidden=true&amp;xsec_source=app_share&amp;type=video&amp;xsec_token=CBCB9peZaRTRZcVhjx4puowQWIr8rSVxYgo5e7qsN9NII=&amp;author_share=1&amp;xhsshare=CopyLink&amp;shareRedId=ODY1REdHSUs2NzUyOTgwNjY0OThHNz9B&amp;apptime=1745280266&amp;share_id=3005657117cb4765a5d570aaa666de5c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>, while speaking English, he told his mother after washing the dishes: “You’re not thanking me. You’d better be nice.” He continued: “Maybe tomorrow, I’m not going to wash the dishes. You have no cards.” Then he repeated it in Chinese.</p><p>His mother spanked him with a bamboo back scratcher and yelled: “Do I have the cards now?”</p><p>The title of the video is “Mom Has the Cards.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Li Yuan writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/new-new-world">The New New World</a> column, which focuses on China’s growing influence on the world by examining its businesses, politics and society.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jd-vance">JD Vance</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>No Plans to Fire Powell: </strong>The president said he has “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-jerome-powell-fed.html">no intention” of ousting Jerome Powell</a>, the Federal Reserve chair, but the administration’s willingness to challenge norms regarding the central bank’s political independence is causing concern.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Agency Angst: </strong>The Trump administration has deployed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/eeoc-trump-dei-law-firms.html">to seek retribution against corporate law firms.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>I.M.F. and World Bank: </strong>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/bessent-imf-world-bank-overhauls.html">called for major overhauls to the missions</a> of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank but said that the United States remained committed to maintaining its leadership role at the global economic institutions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Active Research Awards Terminated:</strong> The National Science Foundation canceled more than 400 active awards, according to a list obtained by The Times.
