Officer Ignacio said he noted the license plate, and checked later to see that the car was registered to Bad Boy Productions, Inc., one of Mr. Combs’s companies.</p><p>Once inside the home, Officer Ignacio said, he saw “high-valued” watches and purses out on a table, but the home otherwise appeared to be undisturbed. Mr. Mescudi then arrived in his Porsche; he appeared “flustered,” Officer Ignacio said, and gave a police report.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Under cross-examination from Brian Steel, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, Officer Ignacio agreed that the episode was a trespassing and not a burglary. Mr. Mescudi, he said, did not report anything stolen from his home,</p><p>The story of Mr. Mescudi and his conflict with Mr. Combs is a key part of the government’s racketeering case against Mr. Combs, the music mogul also known as Puff Daddy and Diddy. The government contends that Mr. Combs intimidated Mr. Mescudi, and later directed the destruction of his car, out of jealousy when Mr. Mescudi briefly dated Casandra Ventura, who was Mr. Combs’s on-and-off girlfriend.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Mescudi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/arts/music/kid-cudi-sean-combs-diddy-trial.html" title="">testified</a> about the break-in at his home, and that he suspected that a few weeks later Mr. Combs had his car blown up with a Molotov cocktail.</p><p>Mr. Combs is charged with racketeering and sex trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and has denied having anything but consensual sex with women. Lawyers for Mr. Combs have said their client was “simply not involved” in the arson incident outlined in the indictment.</p><p>Later today, jurors are expected to hear testimony from a former personal assistant of Mr. Combs who prosecutors say was coerced into sex with the mogul, and who is being identified in court only by the pseudonym “Mia.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For months before trial, little was disclosed about Mia — then identified only as “Victim-4” — other than that she is a former Combs employee who prosecutors say was coerced into sex with him. In one filing last month, the government redacted virtually an entire page-long passage about her.</p><p>But in opening statements this month, lawyers for both sides fleshed out the woman’s profile somewhat. Emily A. Johnson, a prosecutor, described Mia as a former personal assistant whom Mr. Combs “worked to the bone for years.” At some point, she said, he then “forced himself on her sexually, putting his hand up her dress, unzipping his pants and forcing her to perform oral sex, and sneaking into her bed to penetrate her against her will.”</p><p>“Mia will tell you how she could not talk about what happened to her until recently,” Ms. Johnson added, “how she wanted to take the secret of what the defendant did to her to her grave.”</p><p>Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, asked jurors to “evaluate” what motives Mia may have in testifying, and indicated that the defense, as they did with Ms. Ventura, may use texts messages or other communications in an effort to undermine her testimony on the stand.</p><p>“What are the reasons she is saying what she might be saying now, what she never said before, and certainly never said when she first started cooperating with the government?” Ms. Geragos asked in her opening statement. “This is someone you should evaluate her messages carefully, ones of unbelievable love for Combs throughout her employment.”</p><p>Mia has also been cited by a number of witnesses throughout the trial, suggesting that she may be asked to corroborate accusations made by Ms. Ventura and others.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The core of Mia’s testimony is expected to relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge against Mr. Combs. That charge, which carries a possible life sentence, alleges that the music mogul operated a “criminal enterprise” in which employees, including security guards and high-ranking executives of his companies, carried out crimes on Mr. Combs’s behalf and helped cover them up.</p><p>Among the crimes that the government cites as being part of this enterprise are sex trafficking, arson, bribery, forced labor and obstruction of justice. In the case of Mia, the indictment alleges that Mr. Combs “obtained the forced labor of one of his employees (‘Victim-4’), including sexual activity with the defendant, through force and threats of serious harm.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
