<p><em>One of the most iconic clips in all of VCT.</em></p>

<p>After being signed by NAVI for franchising, SUYGETSU and the rest of his team struggled to find the same success they had before. They started their time with their new organization with a top four finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo" target="_blank">LOCK//IN</a>, but have otherwise been unable to make it deep at any other events. In 2024, they failed to even qualify for an international event, being eliminated each time in the opening single-elimination round of playoffs. NAVI are now looking for a near full rebuild, having already moved on from three of their starting roster members.</p>

<p>NAVI is now:</p>

		<p>Nah EMEA can be cooking. The Navi roster needed a shake up but all the players are proven to be great. Suygetsu, Zyppan and Ardiis can all be good veteran choices for teams looking rebuild a new roster(any team that didn&#39;t do great). Lowkey I could see some good teams come out of this offseason if these teams are willing to make some big changes.</p>

		<p>Well yes, except for TH from EMEA nobody had a normal season, Fnatic only, but there Derke is more likely to leave than to be removed. And if we talk about Navi, they had the worst season at all, considering that the roster&#39;s ambition is to get to the tournaments at least.</p>

			<p>In fact, it was announced a long time ago that the entire roster is on the bench, then Ardis confirmed it and the players have been looking for teams for a long time. The team will be completely rebuilt</p>
<p>When they announce it like this, it means players have already found one and they are signing a contract with another organization. There are already a lot of rumors around Ange1 in other organizations, only about Shao nothing is heard - most likely he is the only one who will stay, but so far he is also on the bench</p>		</div>
