Trump is sworn in.</p><p>But by the time it was rolled out to lawmakers on Tuesday night, it had transformed into a true Christmas tree of a bill, adorned with all manner of unrelated policy measures in the kind of year-end catchall that Republicans have long derided. It is a 1,547-page behemoth of a package with provisions including foreign investment restrictions, new health care policies and a stadium site for the Washington Commanders.</p><p>The package was on life support on Wednesday night as G.O.P. lawmakers balked at its details, a backlash further fueled by a condemnation by President-elect Donald J. Trump, who called it full of “DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS,” and his close ally Elon Musk.</p><p>End-of-year spending bills often become magnets for unrelated measures, fueled by last-minute spasms of deal-cutting by lawmakers who recognize it could be their last chance to get something done. That was even more true this year with Democrats bracing for a Republican governing trifecta come January, and Speaker Mike Johnson arriving at the negotiating table sapped of leverage because a large group of his members refuses to vote for any spending measure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Johnson had another incentive to allow the package to balloon: He could satisfy some longstanding bipartisan desires with minimal Republican fingerprints, merely blaming a Democratic Senate and White House for any bloat in the deal. He will not have that luxury in a few weeks, when Republicans control all of Congress and Mr. Trump is in the White House.</p><p>“We’ve got to get this done because here’s the key: By doing this, we are clearing the decks, and we are setting up for Trump to come in roaring back with the America First agenda,” Mr. Johnson said on “Fox and Friends” on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Here are some of the provisions that made it into the bill.</p><h3 id="link-47ad64a9"><span>Disaster aid</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A home damaged by Hurricane Helene in Swannanoa, N.C., in October.

Included in that money is $21 billion to help farmers whose crops were ravaged by natural disasters.</p><p>The bill also provides full funding for the reconstruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore that collapsed in March.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-4d916e68"><span>Payments to farmers</span></h3><p>Lawmakers set aside $10 billion in direct economic assistance, available to any farmer who applied for a federal agricultural funding program such as crop insurance, subsidies or disaster assistance in 2024. The aid would be distributed based on how many acres of eligible crops they grow. Proponents argued it was necessary in part because Republicans and Democrats had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/politics/farm-bill-congress.html" title="">failed to reach agreement on a new farm bill</a>, leaving subsidy payments at a level set six years ago.</p><h3 id="link-5b0e2f94"><span>A pay raise for lawmakers</span></h3><p>It has been more than a decade since members of Congress have gotten a cost-of-living increase in their salaries. Lawmakers, loath to be seen giving themselves a pay raise while their constituents face economic challenges, have routinely included language in spending bills that exempts them from the wage increases that other federal employees receive.</p><p>In a legislative sleight of hand reported earlier by Bloomberg Government, the spending bill’s drafters omitted that provision this time, positioning themselves for a raise of 3.8 percent, or about $6,600 for most members, whose current salary is $174,000.</p><p>Some lawmakers have long argued that they should be allowed to receive cost-of-living increases to ensure that average people — not just the ultrawealthy — can afford to serve in Congress. Others have contended that the appearance of self-dealing has made the issue too toxic.</p><p>Already one centrist House Democrat, Representative Jared Golden of Maine, who narrowly held his seat in November in his Trump-won district, has said he will oppose the bill because of this measure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h3 id="link-18f74cf2"><span>Restrictions on investment in Chinese technology companies</span></h3><p>The bill would broaden the scope of restrictions President Biden imposed last year on American investment in key Chinese technology industries, expanding the list of prohibited technologies to include many that could be used in integrated circuits for military, intelligence or mass surveillance purposes.</p><h3 id="link-5c1c6b36"><span>Child care</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, left, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington during a news conference last year.

Kennedy Memorial Stadium from the federal government to the District of Columbia, paving the way for the Washington Commanders football team <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5932523/2024/11/19/washington-commanders-rfk-stadium-senate-committee-bill-passed/" title="">to move their stadium from Maryland</a> to play home games in the nation’s capital.</p></li><li><p>Criminalizing the publication of “nonconsensual intimate visual depictions,” including deepfake pornography, and requiring social media platforms to have procedures in place to remove the content after being notified by a victim.</p></li><li><p>Imposing new restrictions on pharmacy benefit managers, the companies hired by employers and government programs like Medicare to negotiate drug prices and oversee prescriptions. The measures would discourage those companies from steering patients toward more expensive drugs.</p></li><li><p>Throwing out a requirement that lawmakers buy health coverage on an insurance exchange established by the Affordable Care Act and allowing them to get coverage from the traditional federal employee benefits plan.</p></li><li><p>Adding to the existing responsibilities of the assistant secretary of commerce for travel and tourism the additional mandate of promoting “locations and events in the United States that are important to music tourism.”</p></li></ul><p>Karoun Demirjian<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>16</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Where the Money Is Going: Hurricane Relief, Farmers, a Stadium and a Raise<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Congress</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Capitol Hill.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Gaetz Report: </strong>The House Ethics Committee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/matt-gaetz-ethics-report-release.html">secretly voted to release a report</a> into the conduct of former Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida.
