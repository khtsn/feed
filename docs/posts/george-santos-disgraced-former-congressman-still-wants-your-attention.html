A mix of tabloid writers, influencers and low-level Republican operatives had turned up there for a party he was throwing. It was ostensibly to toast the launch of his podcast, which carried the too-cute-by-half title of “Pants on Fire With George Santos.”</p><p>You remember George Santos, right?</p><p>It was at about this time last year when his short-lived career as a congressman from New York — a young, gay, Latino and Republican one at that — exploded spectacularly after he was exposed as a liar of epic, almost literary proportions. He lied about things big and small, stupid and serious. There were lies about money and employment and college degrees and dressing in drag. Lies about Jewish ancestry, Sept. 11, a gay nightclub shooting, a Broadway production of “Spider-Man” and a pet charity. He lied about volleyball.</p><p>It was a truly great story, a farce about truth and shamelessness and the limits of partisan baboonery in American life and politics in (what was believed to be then) the post-Trump era. Newspaper editors assigned whole reporting teams to cover him and his deceptions. Big-shot magazine journalists and television anchors begged for interviews and access. The media frenzy reached such a pitch that Mr. Santos was compared, however ironically, to Princess Diana in many a viral meme (“Saturday Night Live” even made a joke about it). And then, at last, he was expelled from Congress. The fade to black happened fast, as it always does.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And so there he was, one year later, in a tiny canteen near Times Square, just trying to get a little ink like old times.</p><p>“I think the last time we saw an international media frenzy like that <em>was</em> Lady Di,” he said. “I’m not comparing myself to Princess Diana. I’m just saying the truth.” But, as Holly Golightly said, there are certain shades of limelight that can wreck a girl’s complexion. “Well, if you know how to walk out of the limelight in a way that you can capitalize on it,” he said, gesturing at an advertisement for his podcast that had been erected inside the bar.</p><p>In August, Mr. Santos, 36, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft and owned up to all sorts of other schemes. “I allowed my ambition to cloud my judgment,” he told the judge that day. His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 7, and most of his party guests on Monday said they expected he would soon be locked up, though for how long, nobody seemed sure (he faces a minimum of two years). Asked if he felt nervous about going to prison, he said: “Of course I’m nervous. It’s a big deal. I don’t want to go to prison. I have so much to look forward to, so it’s something that’s definitely stressful.”</p><p>One of his very first friends in the news media was a journalist named Skye Ostreicher, who got to know him when she was covering local politics for <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">City &amp; State</a>. She stood by the bar Monday and said she would definitely visit her buddy behind bars. “I told him I would bring him eyeliner or whatever beauty products he wants me to sneak in for him,” she said with a laugh.</p><p>Also there was a young man who Mr. Santos introduced as his husband of three years. “My fictitional husband,” Mr. Santos said drolly. “Remember, nobody believed he existed?” He seemed to still be smarting over certain aspects of his coverage, able to recite specific sentences from year-old magazine articles about him that he did not appreciate at the time and does not appreciate now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There were at least three New York Post reporters there, as well as one writer named Zak Stone who had been sent by Butt magazine, a biannual gay publication printed on pink paper. Dressed in an oversize Balenciaga sweater and baggy black pants he said he had purchased in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, Mr. Stone looked a bit out of place among the disheveled tabloid crop. “I listened to the first podcast episode — it was OK,” he said. “I am curious how they’re going to keep going with it if he’s in jail.”</p><p>Mr. Santos said he was mostly finished with politics — “so toxic” — and sees himself more as a cultural commentator. Yet he said he could not help but occasionally “dish” about the members of Congress he got to know from his short time on Capitol Hill. Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, remains his favorite. “She’s my bestie, for sure,” he said. One Republican representative he does not like is Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has been battling against transgender activists lately. Mr. Santos has been flambéing her on X.</p><p>“She’s unhinged,” he said. “I agree with her fight, I disagree with her antics. Her antics are of somebody who is manic compulsive.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Ms. Mace declined to comment.</p><p>The congresswoman had recently said she was “physically accosted” by one activist who shook her hand so aggressively that she needed a brace for her wrist. But Mr. Santos wasn’t sure what to believe. “A lot of people are saying the sling is fake,” he said. “I’m not going to go and say that, because I don’t want to be sued, but I would really think she should shut the rumors down by just putting an X-ray out there. Show us the hairline fracture!”</p><p>This seemed rather rich, considering Mr. Santos is still orchestrating stunts. Over the weekend, video footage of a man confronting him in Times Square and angrily flinging a milkshake at his face began to circulate on the internet. It kicked up an outrage and a serious-minded discourse about just how volatile our politics have become. But it turned out the whole thing was fake. As Mr. Santos revealed in a subsequent video, he had staged the encounter as part of a “promo campaign” to draw attention to his podcast. But then, he claimed, he decided against posting it and never meant for it to get out, but, somehow, a friend leaked it. Or something.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the bar, he said his dream podcast guest would be President-elect Donald J. Trump. But then he paused and thought for a moment. “All right, you know what, let me give you better than that,” he said. “I want to interview Gisele Bündchen.”</p><p>A young man sat down at the piano and began to play “Linus and Lucy” from “A Charlie Brown Christmas” while Mr. Santos moved around the room, stopping to chat with each guest. It all vaguely had the air of a going-away party.</p><p>Does he ever miss all the attention he once commanded? “It’s not that I liked the attention,” Mr. Santos said. “I understood the attention. And I tried to make the best I could out of it.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
