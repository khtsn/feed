But there is no precedent for the close relative of a sitting president to host a high-profile show on a major television news channel.</p><p>“My View With Lara Trump,” expected to air on Saturdays at 9 p.m. Eastern, will include a mix of analysis and interviews with influential figures. The network is describing the show as focused on “the return of common sense to all corners of American life,” echoing a term, “common sense,” that the Trump administration has frequently deployed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Trump, 42, who is married to the president’s son Eric, is no stranger to a television studio. She worked for several years as a producer on “Inside Edition,” and served as an on-air contributor to Fox News from March 2021 to December 2022.</p><p>“Lara was a total professional and a natural when she was with us years ago,” Suzanne Scott, the chief executive of Fox News Media, told The New York Times in a message on Wednesday. “She is very talented and is a strong, effective communicator with great potential as a host.”</p><p>Last year, at the urging of her father-in-law, Ms. Trump ran for and was elected co-chair of the Republican National Committee. She helped oversee the party’s finances, electoral operations and nominating convention in Milwaukee. She stepped down from the role last month.</p><p>Ms. Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lara-trump-rnc-florida-senate-d0b9102b1095c383173bd6e24bbca015" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a reporter</a> in December that she “would seriously consider” pursuing the Senate seat in Florida vacated by Marco Rubio, who is now secretary of state. By January, however, she was in discussions with Ms. Scott about a formal role with the network.</p><p>Presidential progeny have taken jobs at television news networks in the past, but not while their father (or, in Ms. Trump’s case, father-in-law) was running the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jenna Bush Hager joined NBC’s “Today” in 2009, a few months after her father, George W. Bush, finished his second term; she is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/arts/television/jenna-bush-hager-is-happy-reporting-for-today.html" title="">now a staple</a> of NBC’s morning programming. Chelsea Clinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/business/media/chelsea-clinton-hired-by-nbc-news.html" title="">worked at NBC News</a> from 2011 to 2014, after her father was president, though during a period when her mother, Hillary Clinton, was serving as secretary of state. Chelsea Clinton was a special correspondent who focused on human-interest feature stories.</p><p>Ms. Trump is rejoining Fox News as the network reaches new levels of ratings dominance. Since Election Day, Fox News has had the 636 most-watched telecasts across all of cable news; last month, the network recorded its highest-rated January since its founding in 1996.</p><p>The president occasionally laments his coverage on Fox News, and he and the network have gone through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/business/media/trump-fox-desantis-hannity.html" title="">periods of iciness</a>, including a four-month stretch, in late 2022 and early 2023, when Mr. Trump — who had just announced his candidacy for re-election — did not appear on a single broadcast.</p><p>The Trump-Fox relationship is now on quite solid ground. Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul who controls the network, attended Mr. Trump’s inauguration and on Monday spent time in the Oval Office with the president. Pete Hegseth and Sean Duffy exited their on-air Fox positions in the fall to become Mr. Trump’s secretaries of defense and transportation.</p><p>Ms. Trump, who grew up in Wilmington, N.C., married Eric Trump in 2014. She told The Times in July that she spoke frequently with her father-in-law, mostly about political matters and sometimes about music. (Ms. Trump is <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14240813/Lara-Trump-Donald-Elon-Musk-Mar-Lago-tom-petty.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an amateur singer.</a>) Last year, while serving as Republican Party co-chair, she pledged “four years <a href="https://x.com/patriottakes/status/1781058172205088824" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of scorched earth</a> when Donald Trump retakes the White House.”</p><p>The current occupant of Fox News’s 9 p.m. Saturday slot, Brian Kilmeade, will have his show moved to Sundays at 10 p.m.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
