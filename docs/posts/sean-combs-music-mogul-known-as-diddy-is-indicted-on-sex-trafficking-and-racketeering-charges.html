To commit these acts, the prosecutors said, Mr. Combs relied on the help of the employees of his business.</p><p>Mr. Combs, 54, was expected to appear for an arraignment later on Tuesday at a federal courthouse in Manhattan.</p><p>“He’s going to plead not guilty, obviously,” Marc Agnifilo, one of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, said outside the courthouse on Tuesday morning. “He’s going to fight this with all of his energy and all of his might, and the full confidence of his lawyers. And I expect a long battle with a good result for Mr. Combs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The charges against Mr. Combs were revealed a day after he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html" title="">arrested in a Manhattan hotel room</a>, following a federal investigation that has been active since at least early this year. In March, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/arts/music/diddy-sean-combs-home-raided.html" title="">federal agents raided his homes</a> in Los Angeles and Miami Beach, Fla.</p><p>The arrest of Mr. Combs — a producer, record executive and performer who is also known as Diddy and Puff Daddy — makes him the highest-profile figure in the music world to face criminal charges for sexual misconduct since R. Kelly, the R&amp;B singer who, after trials in New York and Chicago, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/nyregion/r-kelly-racketeering-sex-abuse.html" title="">sentenced to more than 30 years in prison</a> for child sex crimes, sex trafficking and racketeering.</p><p>Mr. Combs was a key figure in the global rise of hip-hop as a commercial force in the 1990s and 2000s, helping to make stars of rappers and R&amp;B singers like the Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J. Blige. But he has been under public scrutiny since a former girlfriend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit</a> in November accusing him of years of sexual and physical abuse.</p><p>Mr. Combs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/music/cassie-diddy-sean-combs-settlement.html" title="">settled the suit with Ms. Ventura</a> — an R&amp;B singer known as Cassie — in one day, and denied any wrongdoing. But legal pressure quickly mounted, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diddy-sean-combs-lawsuit-allegations.html" title="">the filing of five successive lawsuits</a> by women alleging sexual assault and three other sexual misconduct suits, all of which Mr. Combs’s lawyers are fighting in court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marc Agnifilo, one of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, addressed reporters outside the federal courthouse on Tuesday morning.

Prosecutors have been sending subpoenas to witnesses for months.</p><p>In anticipation of an indictment, Mr. Combs recently traveled to New York to make himself available to law enforcement. For days he had been staying at the Park Hyatt New York hotel on West 57th Street, largely hunkering down while awaiting any news but also drawing some attention on social media with a visit to Harlem, where he grew up.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
