Mr. Trump and his allies had long denounced that money as wasteful, and the Transportation Department froze the program’s continued funding in February.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Reviewing that action, the Government Accountability Office determined on Thursday that the funding halt had amounted to an improper impoundment, since the administration had denied money to states that lawmakers had previously approved. The government “must continue to carry out the statutory requirements of the program,” the watchdog said.</p><p>Impoundments are restricted under a 1970s law that also empowers the accountability office to monitor — and, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law/impoundment-control-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potentially, to go to court</a> — to force the release of frozen money. The Government Accountability Office is a nonpartisan arm of Congress with a vast remit, including the responsibility to monitor the nation’s spending.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Transportation Department also did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-calls-out-states-trying-block-lawful-review" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> this month that the electric-vehicle program had suffered from “inefficient guidance and failed performance,” stressing that his agency had broad latitude to pause funding for further review. In response, California and other states have separately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/climate/electric-vehicle-charging-funding-states-lawsuit.html" title="">sued the Trump administration</a>.</p><p>Late last month, Gene L. Dodaro, the comptroller-general who leads the accountability office, revealed that it had opened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-funds-gao.html" title="">more than three dozen related investigations</a> into the Trump administration, underscoring the extent to which the president and his aides may have interfered with the flow of federal dollars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The oversight body found similar violations of the law during Mr. Trump’s first term. It notably ruled in 2020 that the administration had illegally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/us/politics/gao-trump-ukraine.html" title="">impounded roughly $400 billion</a> in congressionally authorized aid to Ukraine, though the president denied any wrongdoing. Its conclusions ultimately informed congressional Democrats’ efforts to impeach the president.</p><p>In its report, the Government Accountability Office said the Trump administration should have asked Congress to rescind the funds, or the government could have proposed legislative changes to the electric vehicle program. The watchdog did not indicate if it would ultimately invoke its powers under the law to enforce its findings in court.</p><p>But it has emphasized repeatedly that Congress, not the president, has the power to set the nation’s spending. “The Constitution grants the president no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation,” the watchdog wrote in its <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/880/877916.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump has adopted a more expansive view of his budgetary powers. He and his top budget aide, Russell T. Vought, maintain that the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-budget-cuts-russell-vought.html" title="">should be able to ignore some congressional instructions</a> on spending.</p><p>During Mr. Vought’s confirmation hearing to serve as the White House budget director, he told a panel of senators that he also believed the existing limits on impoundment to be unconstitutional. He said he would work with the Justice Department to “explore the parameters of the law,” infuriating Democrats, who attacked the president on Thursday for trying to usurp congressional authority over spending.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This legal decision affirms what we’ve long known: The president is breaking the law to block funding Congress passed on a bipartisan basis and that is owed to the American people — simply because he disagrees with it,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who leads her party in the chamber’s Appropriations Committee.</p><p>“This plain fact is unacceptable,” she added in a statement, “and it cannot stand any longer.”</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought have forged ahead with their agenda in the meantime, moving to fire droves of federal workers and shutter offices and agencies that they believe to be wasteful.</p><p>The Trump administration has conducted that project in parallel with the Department of Government Efficiency, the team of young aides led by the tech billionaire Elon Musk. Officials affiliated with that entity tried to investigate the Government Accountability Office this month, though officials there <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/doge-musk-gao-accountability-office.html" title="">turned them away</a>, claiming they had no authority to scrutinize an independent arm of the legislative branch.</p><p>Congress enacted limits on presidential impoundment in 1974, reflecting lawmakers’ deep misgivings with the way President Richard M. Nixon halted entire categories of funding he disfavored. The law still allows the White House to temporarily pause spending, using a process known as rescission, though the money is restored unless Congress votes to claw it back.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tony Romm is a reporter covering economic policy and the Trump administration for The Times, based in Washington.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Oversight of Local Police: </strong>Days before the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/trump-police-consent-decrees.html">the Trump administration said that it would abandon efforts to reduce police violence</a> there and in several other cities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Justice Dept.
