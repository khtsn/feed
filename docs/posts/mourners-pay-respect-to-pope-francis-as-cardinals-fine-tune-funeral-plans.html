of the Vatican on Thursday as tens of thousands of Catholics paid their respects to Pope Francis and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/pope-francis-death-health-problems.html" title="">preparations for the funeral</a> accelerated.</p><p>The conclave to select the next pope has not yet started — the Vatican has not announced when voting will begin — but cardinals on Thursday morning held their third congregation meeting in the Holy See’s apostolic palace since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-dead.html" title="">Francis died on Easter Monday</a>.</p><p>During the gatherings, the cardinals decide on the logistics of the mourning period, but Vatican experts say they can also set <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-death-traditions-rituals-funeral.html" title="">the agenda for the conclave</a> and privately lay out their priorities as they get ready to choose the next pope. More cardinals have arrived in Rome in recent days ahead of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/europe/pope-francis-funeral-when-time-watch.html" title="">Francis’ funeral on Saturday</a>.</p><p>As they trickled out of a door in the Vatican near the Sant’Anna church on Wednesday, after their second meeting since Francis died, some cardinals outlined topics that they wanted the church to focus on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The central point is the preaching of the authentic faith as it is,” said one conservative cardinal, Mauro Piacenza.</p><p>Most of the cardinals’ decisions that have been publicly disclosed have related to arrangements for Francis’ funeral and commemorations, but the churchmen will also need to pick a date for the conclave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cardinals on Wednesday filed into St. Peter’s Basilica, where the coffin of Pope Francis was lying in state.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Hill for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Francis named many more cardinals than his two predecessors, including a number from outside Europe. As a consequence, a major function of the pre-conclave meetings will be to allow many of the cardinals to get to know each other.</p><p>Fewer than half of the 252 cardinals have arrived in Rome, with 113 attending a meeting on Thursday, the Vatican said. The cardinals were set to meet again on Friday morning, with more arriving ahead of Francis’ funeral.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After the funeral, the meetings can also become a stage for discussion and debates about wider issues facing the church.</p><p>During one of the congregation meetings before the 2013 conclave, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio gave a speech that emphasized the church’s duty to reach those at the “peripheries.” The speech made a significant mark, and Cardinal Bergoglio was elected in the ensuing conclave, becoming Pope Francis.</p><p>The Vatican said on Thursday that because Francis had devoted much of his papacy to marginalized communities, a group of “poor people” would greet his coffin on the steps of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore after the funeral and before his burial.</p><p>Since Wednesday, more than 60,000 people have paid their respects to Francis, whose body was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/europe/pope-francis-coffin-lying-in-state-st-peters.html" title="">lying in state in St. Peter’s Basilica</a>, the Vatican said. The church stayed open until 5.30 a.m. on Thursday and reopened at 7 a.m. as thousands more lined up in St. Peter’s Square to file past his coffin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lining up to pay respects to Pope Francis in St. Peter’s Basilica.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Hill for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Father Joseph Damin, a priest from Haiti, said that he had seen the pope just a few days earlier as Francis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/europe/pope-francis-easter.html" title="">drove amid the faithful</a> after an Easter Mass.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“He was among us giving blessings,” Father Damin said. “It was really striking to see him in a coffin.”</p><p>Some of the mourners had already come to see the body several times.
