We just decided to come last-minute. So we came — flew from Dublin last night. We’re staying for one day, home tonight then. So it just felt it was very important to be here.” “I’ve been here for two hours now already. And we’re not even in there yet. But I don’t even care how many time I wait here. It’s just the opportunity to have this, and how I admired Francisco in his life. And when I saw him in Mexico, it was just an amazing experience that I will never forget. So I think because of the respect that I have for him and the great person he was, it’s worth the wait.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/24/multimedia/24int-pope-update-01-kvwh/24int-pope-update-01-kvwh-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">More than 60,000 people have paid their respects to the late pope’s body in St. Peter’s Basilica since Wednesday, according to the Vatican.
