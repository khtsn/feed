    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another former official said Lt. Gen. William J. Hartman, the deputy at Cyber Command, would serve as the acting director of the N.S.A.</p><p>General Haugh had a cautious public manner, one that ran at odds with the new Pentagon and National Security Council leadership, which has promised aggressive cyberoperations against China.</p><p>General Haugh also served as a top deputy at Cyber Command during the Biden administration and was appointed to his two posts in the previous administration. Former officials said that Trump administration officials viewed General Haugh skeptically as a result of his appointment by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Trump have removed several top officers from their posts including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr.; the chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; and the commandant of the Coast Guard, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250108105924/https://www.uscg.mil/Biographies/Display/Article/3048180/admiral-linda-l-fagan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adm. Linda L. Fagan</a>.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Warner praised General Haugh’s leadership and said his removal would not make the country safer, jabbing at the White House for sharing sensitive material on a commercial messaging application and ousting members of the National Security Council staff <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-meeting-laura-loomer.html" title="">at the urging of Ms. Loomer</a>.</p><p>Amid such actions, Mr. Warner said, the firing of a “nonpartisan, experienced leader” like General Haugh is “astonishing.”</p></div></div>
