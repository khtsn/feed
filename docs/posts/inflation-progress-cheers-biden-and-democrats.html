    <h1>Inflation Progress Cheers Biden and Democrats</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Republicans have been hammering Democrats over inflation and are unlikely to let them off the hook. They continue to note that prices are up nearly 20 percent since President Biden took office and note that the labor market is showing signs of slowing.</p><p>“Despite a small improvement in the rate of price increases, the damage from the Biden-Harris administration’s philosophy of ‘tax it, regulate it, and spend it’ is done and continues to plague the economy,” said Representative Jodey Arrington of Texas, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. “It’s hard to fathom how hardworking American families can survive another four years of the Biden-Harris failed economic agenda.”</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to crack down on corporate price gouging and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/kamala-harris-economy-north-carolina.html" title="">is expected to lay out additional plans</a> for lowering costs in a speech this week.</p><p>Former President Donald J. Trump, her Republican opponent, will hold a rally in Pennsylvania this weekend with a focus on inflation, according to his campaign. He has claimed that the Biden administration’s spending policies have fueled record levels of inflation.</p><p>“Under Kamala Harris, everything costs 20 percent more than it did under President Trump,” said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary. “America cannot afford another four years of Kamala’s failed economic policies.”</p></div></div>
