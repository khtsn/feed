General Assembly.</p><p>Several protests overlapped throughout the day, with the largest winding through Manhattan’s streets and stopping traffic. Tensions between police officers and protesters flared after dark on the Upper East Side, where roughly a dozen protesters were arrested over the course of several hours.</p><p>The demonstrations, organized by several pro-Palestinian groups including Within Our Lifetime and Jewish Voice for Peace, were peaceful and largely orderly for most of the day but escalated after one group of protesters made its way uptown from Grand Central Terminal.</p><p>Outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, police officers on bicycles surrounded a defiant crowd on the sidewalk. On the museum steps, officers held their bicycles in front of them to block the crowd from the front of the building.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>After the march moved on to Park Avenue, officers told the protesters to clear the road and began making arrests when they refused.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Though the protests were largely peaceful, later in the night the police moved in to make arrests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One woman wearing a black head scarf and a kaffiyeh draped around her shoulders shouted to onlookers and raised one hand, flashing a peace sign before officers in bike helmets bound her wrists with a zip tie.</p><p>The group moved downtown from the museum and again tangled with police officers near the Loews Regency hotel, where protest organizers believed Mr. Netanyahu might be staying. Police officers detained several more demonstrators there around 9:30 p.m. before the protest dispersed.</p><p>The clashes came after a morning demonstration near the United Nations headquarters blocked traffic and resulted in 25 arrests, according to the police. Video <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAZLqdtP1D0/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted to social media</a> by Jewish Voice for Peace showed a line of protesters blocking traffic emerging from the First Avenue Tunnel at 48th Street.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the afternoon, thousands of protesters gathered on the steps of the New York Public Library’s main location at Bryant Park. Several speakers addressed the crowd, including Jill Stein, the Green Party’s presidential candidate, who criticized both Democrats and Republicans for their response to the war in Gaza.</p><p>Karen Frost-Arnold, 47, a professor of philosophy, had traveled to Manhattan from Geneva, N.Y., to take part in the afternoon march. Ms. Frost-Arnold said she had wanted to travel to Washington to protest Mr. Netanyahu’s address to Congress in July but had not been able to make the trip.</p><p>“I’ve been looking for a chance to come and let him know that what he’s doing is reprehensible,” Ms. Frost-Arnold said.</p><p>Manny Perez, 37, joined the march after work to protest Mr. Netanyahu’s visit and “the way he’s allowed to walk free and come to the United Nations,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jill Stein, the Green Party’s presidential candidate, addressed the crowd at Bryant Park on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>As the crowd began to march, chanting to the beat of a drum line, a modest line of police officers in helmets and visors stood on the edge of Fifth Avenue, containing the protesters on the sidewalk and allowing traffic to pass. The demonstration took a lap around Midtown, stopping at the security perimeter surrounding the United Nations headquarters before moving west to Eighth Avenue and concluding at Times Square.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That protest remained peaceful and dispersed shortly after 6 p.m.</p><p>There have been numerous protests in New York City since the Hamas attacks on Israel last Oct. 7, which officials say killed 1,200 Israelis. The war in Gaza since has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials.</p><p>The number of pro-Palestinian demonstrations in New York swelled in the spring, when college students across the country erected encampments and called for their administrations to divest from Israeli-linked assets. Some of those led to clashes with counterprotesters and the police, and to mass arrests.</p><p>Many demonstrators on Thursday said that Israel’s recent strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, which have killed hundreds of people and displaced hundreds of thousands more, had reinforced the urgency of their cause.</p><p>Despite efforts by the United States and several other nations to broker a three-week cease-fire to stop the violence between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia based in Lebanon, Mr. Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israeli strikes would continue. He later said in a statement that Israeli officials would continue discussing the U.S. initiative in the coming days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters who had attended previous pro-Palestinian demonstrations said that Israel’s recent strikes on Lebanon had added urgency to their cause.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Before the arrests began on Thursday evening, people blocked traffic for several blocks at a time, following group leaders holding banners, playing drums and shouting call-and-response chants. A group of around 40 police officers wearing helmets and visors brought up the rear of the march.</p><p>Huwaida Hassan, 42, of Union City, N.J., said she felt that a “forced calm” had presided over the protest. Like many demonstrators, she said, she could not afford to get arrested — her children expected her home for dinner.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alyce-mcfadden">More about Alyce McFadden</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/united-nations">United Nations</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
