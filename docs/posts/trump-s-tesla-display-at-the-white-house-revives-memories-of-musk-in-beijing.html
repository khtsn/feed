A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211206025612/http://www.gov.cn/guowuyuan/2019-01/10/content_5356561.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photograph on a Chinese government website</a> shows Mr. Li peering at a Tesla as Mr. Musk, the company’s chief executive, looks on approvingly.</p><p>During that meeting, Mr. Li said that he hoped Mr. Musk could promote the “stability of China-U.S. relations” and offered the billionaire a Chinese green card, according to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6vllikNGnk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state news media outlet CGTN</a>.</p><p>It was a sign of how crucial China was to Tesla’s future at the time. Mr. Musk had just broken ground on a Tesla factory in Shanghai, which was granted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/world/asia/elon-musk-tesla-china.html" title="">unusually favorable conditions</a> by the Chinese government and has since become the company’s most important manufacturing facility in the world. Beijing ensured Tesla low-interest loans, overhauled ownership rules so that the company could set up without a local partner and granted changes that Tesla had sought on emissions regulations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was the second time that Teslas had been displayed in Zhongnanhai. A year earlier, Mr. Musk had posted a photo of himself standing in front of Teslas in the Hall of Purple Light. He had just met with Wang Qishan, China’s vice president at the time. They had a “profoundly interesting discussion of history, philosophy &amp; luck,” Mr. Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1017364353635508224" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>These days, Tesla is struggling in both China, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/tesla-china-sales-elon-musk.html" title="">sales are plunging</a> amid fierce domestic competition, and in the United States, where Mr. Musk’s politics have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/business/elon-musk-tesla-violence-protests-vandalism.html" title="">set off protests and violence</a> at Tesla dealerships and charging stations.</p><p>There was at least one major difference between the Beijing and Washington Tesla shows, however. At the White House, Mr. Musk donned a T-shirt and baseball cap. At Zhongnanhai, he wore a suit.</p><p>Joy Dong<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
