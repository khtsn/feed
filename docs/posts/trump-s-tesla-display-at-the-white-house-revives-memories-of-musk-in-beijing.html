    <h1>Trump’s Tesla Display at the White House Revives Memories of Musk in Beijing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-buy-tesla-elon-musk.html" title="">hawked some Teslas</a> at the White House on Tuesday, it evoked a similar scene from Beijing’s main government compound years earlier, when a top Chinese leader was also photographed alongside Elon Musk examining one of the company’s electric vehicles. </p><p>In January 2019, China’s No. 2 official at the time, Li Keqiang, met with Mr. Musk in the Hall of Purple Light, a pavilion for foreign dignitaries inside the Communist Party’s leadership compound known as Zhongnanhai. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211206025612/http://www.gov.cn/guowuyuan/2019-01/10/content_5356561.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photograph on a Chinese government website</a> shows Mr. Li peering at a Tesla as Mr. Musk, the company’s chief executive, looks on approvingly.</p><p>During that meeting, Mr. Li said that he hoped Mr. Musk could promote the “stability of China-U.S. relations” and offered the billionaire a Chinese green card, according to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6vllikNGnk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state news media outlet CGTN</a>.</p><p>It was a sign of how crucial China was to Tesla’s future at the time. Mr. Musk had just broken ground on a Tesla factory in Shanghai, which was granted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/world/asia/elon-musk-tesla-china.html" title="">unusually favorable conditions</a> by the Chinese government and has since become the company’s most important manufacturing facility in the world. Beijing ensured Tesla low-interest loans, overhauled ownership rules so that the company could set up without a local partner and granted changes that Tesla had sought on emissions regulations. </p></div></div>
