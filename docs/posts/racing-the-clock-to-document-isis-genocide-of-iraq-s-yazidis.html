For them, each uncovered bone fragment could help solve the mystery what became of loved ones not seen since ISIS’s reign of terror.</p><p>“I am waiting for my family’s remains,” said Shireen Khudeeda, a Yazidi woman who was captured, along with her family, by ISIS in 2014, “and I believe they are there.”</p><p>The liberation in 2017 of areas formerly held by ISIS revealed previously untold atrocities. Soon after, at the request of the Iraqi government, the U.N. put together a team of investigators <a href="https://www.unitad.un.org/who_we_are" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">known as UNITAD</a> to obtain, document and store evidence of those crimes so that courts around the world could prosecute cases. The Iraqi authorities in September 2023<span>  </span>informed the U.N. investigators that they would have only one more year to finish the mission.<span>  </span></p><p>Alo Antar, the pit near Tal Afar where ISIS dumped bodies, is one of 68 mass graves the U.N. team has helped excavate, and now, it may be the last. As of July, the Iraqi authorities had identified 93 mass graves that were believed to contain the remains of Yazidi victims; 32 remain unopened in the Sinjar and Al-Ba’aj districts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Out of the thousands of Yazidis who are unaccounted for, the remains of fewer than 700 people have been exhumed, but only 243 bodies have been identified and returned to their families.</p><p>The work at Alo Antar, a natural pit more than 30 feet deep, is difficult and complicated, said Alan Robinson, the chief of UNITAD’s forensic science unit. But the findings, he said, have been revealing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alo Antar, a natural pit near Tal Afar, Iraq, was used by ISIS as a mass grave in 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">United Nations</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some remains, he said, were interred in body bags, the corpses inside clad in the orange jumpsuits once seen in ISIS propaganda videos. Others were found alongside toothbrushes and blood pressure pills that they had grabbed when they fled. Many victims’ hands were bound behind their backs, and others were blindfolded. Preliminary findings showed that some had suffered gunshot wounds, while others appeared to have died from being pushed into the pit.</p><p>Iraq’s complicated environmental conditions meant that some remains were mummified rather than skeletonized, Mr. Robinson said, resulting in intense odors of decomposition when they were uncovered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Between seven and 10 years after their death, the smell could be overpowering still,” Mr. Robinson said, “so you can imagine how it was closer to the time of their death.”</p><p>The government’s decision to end UNITAD’s mission is part of a broader push by the Iraqi government to emphasize its national sovereignty at a time when U.S. troops are still stationed in the country and many politicians are closely aligned with Iran, a U.S. adversary.</p><p>Ending its reliance on U.N. institutions may be part of Iraq’s attempts to shift its image, said Sarah Sanbar, an Iraq researcher for Human Rights Watch. In May, the country called for an end to the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, which was created after the U.S. invasion in 2003 to help Iraq develop government institutions, hold elections and protect human rights. That mission is set to end by December 2025.</p><p>“Iraq wants to portray itself as a sovereign, post-conflict country,” Ms. Sanbar said, and some internal factions view the U.N.’s presence there as “unwarranted international interference in Iraqi affairs.”</p><p>The government’s key complaint, Ms. Sanbar said, “was that UNITAD refused to hand over the evidence it had collected to Iraqi authorities, even though it was sharing it with other states prosecuting ISIS fighters.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Family members burying the remains of Yazidi victims who were exhumed from mass graves in Sinjar, Iraq, in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The U.N., which opposes capital punishment, would prefer that ISIS’s crimes are prosecuted without the possibility of the death penalty.
