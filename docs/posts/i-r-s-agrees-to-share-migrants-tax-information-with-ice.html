Under the terms of the deal, a redacted version of which was submitted in the case, ICE officials can ask the I.R.S. for information about people who have been ordered to leave the United States — or whom they are otherwise investigating.</p><p>Federal law tightly controls taxpayer information, protecting home addresses, earnings and other data from disclosure even to other agencies within the government. I.R.S. officials have for weeks warned that the Trump administration’s plan to use the I.R.S. to help with deportations could be illegal. The top I.R.S. lawyer was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-irs-lawyer-doge.html" title="">demoted</a> as the agreement came together, and was replaced by a former Trump nominee.</p><p>“It’s unprecedented,” Nina Olson, the executive director of the Center for Taxpayer Rights and a former top I.R.S. official, said of the Trump administration’s plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There are narrow exceptions to the prohibition on sharing tax information, and the agreement shows that the Trump administration will rely on a carve-out allowing the use of taxpayer information in criminal investigations. Immigration advocacy groups have sued to try to block any information sharing, and the Trump administration disclosed the agreement in response to that suit.</p><p>Millions of undocumented workers pay taxes, improving the financial outlook for federal programs like Social Security. The I.R.S. has encouraged them to submit tax returns using a nine-digit code called an individual taxpayer identification number. Immigration activists and tax lawyers said they had long trusted that the I.R.S. would protect the confidentiality of migrants’ tax information, which includes where people live and work, and details about their families.</p><p>The change in approach from the I.R.S. could drive more immigrants to stop filing their taxes and seek under-the-table jobs, economists said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Duehren covers tax policy for The Times from Washington.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> An Accidental Journey to a Salvadoran Prison:</strong> Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s story began six years ago, and took an even darker turn when he was recently deported — even though a judge had already decided he could remain in the United States, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/el-salvador-deportation-migrant-trump.html">concerned he might be tortured in his homeland</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Detained Woman Dies: </strong>A Chinese woman detained by U.S. border officers for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/chinese-woman-detained-suicide-border.html">overstaying a visitor visa</a> died by suicide while being held at a border patrol station in Arizona, a Democratic congresswoman said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservative Voices Raise Alarm:</strong> As the administration has rushed to carry out deportations as quickly as possible, the unified front in favor of President Trump’s immigration purge is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-immigration-joe-rogan-conservatives.html">beginning to crack</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nobel Laureate’s Visa Revoked: </strong>Óscar Arias Sánchez, twice president of Costa Rica, has been a vocal critic of Trump.
