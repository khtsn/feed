He demanded that Mr. Zelensky thank Mr. Trump for his leadership. Mr. Trump jumped in and told the Ukrainian leader, “You’re not really in a good position right now” and “You’re gambling with World War III.”</p><p>“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Mr. Trump added. “And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.”</p><p>Mr. Zelensky’s hurriedly arranged visit to Washington on Friday was meant to smooth over a rift with Mr. Trump, who has effectively sided with Russia while falsely blaming Ukraine for starting the war and calling Mr. Zelensky a “dictator.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Minutes after the shouting match, Mr. Trump seemed to call off the rest of the visit. </p><p>“I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” he wrote on Truth Social. “I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”</p><p>For President Zelensky, wrapping up a deal with the Trump administration for a share of Ukrainian natural resources would have opened the way for more consequential talks on U.S. military backing and on the terms of a possible cease-fire with Russia.</p><h2 id="link-6dc8c9e3">Terms of the agreement</h2><p>The mineral deal that is now in jeopardy would have created a U.S.-controlled fund that would receive revenue from Ukraine’s natural resources, according to a draft reviewed by The Times:</p><ul><li><p>Ukraine would have contributed to the fund half of its revenues from the future monetization of natural resources and associated infrastructure, such as liquefied natural gas terminals and port infrastructure</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The fund would not draw on revenue from existing mines, oil wells or other natural resources businesses.</p></li><li><p>The fund would be designed to reinvest some revenues into Ukraine.</p></li><li><p>In a second phase, the two countries would need to negotiate a more detailed plan to set up the fund. Zelensky has said Ukraine’s Parliament would need to ratify this second agreement. “This is important to me,” Mr. Zelensky said. “Between the first step and the second step, we need to understand where we stand with the United States.”</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-3a12b4d5">Security guarantee</h2><p>The draft <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/europe/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-security.html" title="">vaguely referenced security guarantees</a>, but did not signal any specific U.S. commitment to safeguarding Ukraine’s security — a provision Kyiv has vigorously pressed to include as the war with Russia enters its fourth year.</p><p>A copy of the agreement obtained Wednesday by The New York Times included a sentence stating that the United States “supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.” Previous drafts did not include the phrase.</p><p>“I’m not going to provide security guarantees beyond very much,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-ukraine-cabinet.html" title="">Mr. Trump said during his first cabinet meeting</a> on Wednesday. “We’re going to have Europe do that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-16adbf1d">What Ukraine wants</h2><p>As Mr. Zelensky prepared to meet with Mr. Trump on Friday morning, he had two things on his mind: getting a seat at the negotiating table with Moscow and assuring safeguards against future Russian aggression.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Ukraine’s 28th Separate Marine Brigade firing toward a Russian target near Pokrovsk, Ukraine, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump has offered Mr. Zelensky no role as yet in talks with Russia that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">opened this month in Saudi Arabia.</a> Mr. Zelensky has said he will accept no deal without Ukraine’s involvement.</p><p>The Ukrainian leader has made clear that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-deal.html" title="">the agreement on natural resources</a> — which would grant half the country’s future revenues from oil, natural gas and mining to a fund that is controlled in part by the United States — is not an end in itself.
