After several cannonballs and rock slides, Mr. Rumsey, who lives in a nearby town, said that he had rescued at least three people from the pool over the years.</p><p>“If you jump too close to the waterfall, you get pulled into the current and down,” he said.

Several parents clustered in the shade next to the ledges, chatting as they kept a wary eye on the children’s back flips and occasional belly-flops. Many of the parents had grown up going to the swimming hole and wanted their children to experience the spot, even if they no longer lived close by.</p><p>“It’s a ritual,” said Michael Blaskewicz, 48, as he watched his son Mason, 15, confidently thrust himself off the cliff, followed tentatively by his brother Marcus, 10.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left to right: Matt Achin, 62; Dan Desrochers, 64; Tyghe Smalley, 46; John Desrochers, 62; Bill Curren, 63; and Sean Connor, 63.
