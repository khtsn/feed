<p>In 2023, the team took to the international stage for the first time as one of China&#39;s strongest teams but struggled to find any wins there, going out 0-1 at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1188/champions-tour-2023-lock-in-s-o-paulo/bracket-stage" target="_blank">LOCK//IN</a> and 0-2 at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1657/valorant-champions-2023/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions 2023</a>. </p>

		<p>Actually, 99.99% of the viewers in VCTCN want Berlin to leave FPX and VCTCN. The reason is that last year during his livestream in China, he refused to acknowledge that he is Chinese (which is the most sensitive and intolerable line to cross in China). Because of this, both FPX and Berlin have faced a lot of criticism from the audience. Due to the pressure outside of the game, FPX has been affected and has rapidly declined, getting worse and worse. Berlin&#39;s health issues are related to psychological problems. After Berlin announced his departure, the Chinese audience and fans are now very happy. Players like Life, Yosemite, and Autumn are well-loved and have a lot of fans. Fans no longer feel embarrassed about loving FPX.</p>

		<p>In China, most political issues are open for discussion, but the only thing that is banned by everyone (not only the government, but all Chinese) is regional independence, and any Taiwanese actor or singer who supports independence will be permanently banned, let alone a esports player. Players like SIMON (EDG) and LUKE (DRG) have said they are from Taiwan, China. It&#39;s a prerequisite for them to work in China (even if that&#39;s not what they actually think), and Berlin clearly has no brains, he ruined his career on his own</p>

		<p>that&#39;s the thing. people and the government don&#39;t see Taiwan as it&#39;s own country, so it&#39;s as ridiculous to them as someone born in bumfuck Rhode Island refusing to claim that they&#39;re American. Now combine this with geopolitics and the Century of Humiliation and you have what we have now</p>

		<p>The Chinese Government adheres to the one-China principle and opposes any form of secessionist activities aimed at “Taiwan independence”. He could say that, at the cost of leaving China, because that was the law of China. You can&#39;t work in a country and break local rules (btw this is the toughest rule).</p>
