		<p>Actually, 99.99% of the viewers in VCTCN want Berlin to leave FPX and VCTCN. The reason is that last year during his livestream in China, he refused to acknowledge that he is Chinese (which is the most sensitive and intolerable line to cross in China). Because of this, both FPX and Berlin have faced a lot of criticism from the audience. Due to the pressure outside of the game, FPX has been affected and has rapidly declined, getting worse and worse. Berlin&#39;s health issues are related to psychological problems. After Berlin announced his departure, the Chinese audience and fans are now very happy. Players like Life, Yosemite, and Autumn are well-loved and have a lot of fans. Fans no longer feel embarrassed about loving FPX.</p>
