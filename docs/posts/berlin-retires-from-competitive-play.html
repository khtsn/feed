		<p>ay come on, they&#39;re solid players I mean they already took Yosemite from BLG I wouldn&#39;t see why they would sign other players from them too. But Shr1mp is a good choice anyways</p>

</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4644619">
		
		
		<p>Look, I have nothing against you-  but- B3ar??? You mean the guy who hasn&#39;t play for BLG in like 14 months? The guy who dropped K/Ds like:</p>

</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4644674">
		
		
		<p>Hmm... I think you&#39;re right, but rin is solid right? I mean we can both agree that FPX could&#39;ve signed a Tier 1 Chinese player instead of a Tier 2 player who doesn&#39;t even look that good?</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4644685">
		
		
		<p>That&#39;s the thing, man. The metas have changed a lot, and I wouldn&#39;t bank on someone who got dropped by BLG and hasn&#39;t played a game since 2023. I think it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to try to instead give a chance to someone who could thrive after the step up to Tier 1. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re really getting until you try. Of course, he could totally flop and look worse than B3ar, but that&#39;s still better than betting it all on someone like rin who hasn&#39;t played since 2023.</p>

		<p>FPX&#39;s new IGL is rumored to be shrimp, but that&#39;s not even the main issue. FPX&#39;s macro just needs improving and I think that would take a good coach.</p>

<p>In a statement on his personal Weibo, BerLIN cited health issues as the main reason for his retirement. He explained that he did not want these issues to affect his teammates and expressed a desire to return once his condition improves.</p>

		<p>Actually, 99.99% of the viewers in VCTCN want Berlin to leave FPX and VCTCN. The reason is that last year during his livestream in China, he refused to acknowledge that he is Chinese (which is the most sensitive and intolerable line to cross in China). Because of this, both FPX and Berlin have faced a lot of criticism from the audience. Due to the pressure outside of the game, FPX has been affected and has rapidly declined, getting worse and worse. Berlin&#39;s health issues are related to psychological problems. After Berlin announced his departure, the Chinese audience and fans are now very happy. Players like Life, Yosemite, and Autumn are well-loved and have a lot of fans. Fans no longer feel embarrassed about loving FPX.</p>
