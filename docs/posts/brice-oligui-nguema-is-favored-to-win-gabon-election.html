They say the race has been rigged in favor of Brice Oligui Nguema, the general who staged a coup in 2023 and has ignored his early promises to hand power over to a civilian.</p><p>“It is not a level playing field to begin with,” said Joseph Siegle, director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, a Washington-based organization that is part of the U.S. Department of Defense. </p><p>Gabon is a resource-rich country of 2.5 million that was long ruled by one family. Although wealthier than other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, unemployment is widespread and poverty is high, making those key issues for voters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is what to know about the presidential contest. </p><h2 id="link-6525653a">Who are the main contenders?</h2><p>A 50-year-old general who swapped his uniform for jeans, Jordan sneakers and <a href="https://x.com/moi_makaya/status/1909129497544192343?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Jackson’s</a> dance moves on the campaign trail, Mr. Nguema is widely tipped to win.</p><p>Mr. Nguema served as an aide-de-camp to Gabon’s long-ruling autocrat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/world/africa/09bongo.html" title="">Omar Bongo</a>, and was head of the Republican Guard under his son, Ali Bongo Ondimba, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/31/world/africa/ali-bongo-ondimba-gabon-coup.html" title="">deposed</a> in 2023. </p><p>With that coup, Mr. Nguema ended the run of one of Africa’s longest-ruling families.<span>  </span>Omar Bongo held power for 41 years, and his son held office for 14. </p><p>The coup was the latest of nine military takeovers that have shaken West and Central Africa since 2020. </p><p>But Mr. Nguema has rebranded himself as a conventional candidate in the election, with the campaign slogan “It’s good,” or “C’BON” in French, a play on his initials.<span>  </span>He has promised to build large infrastructure projects, including a new airport, calling himself “Brice the Builder.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He has also vowed to preserve ties with France, the former colonial power, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/europe/france-chad-military-ally.html" title="">has recently been ordered to withdraw</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/world/africa/ivory-coast-france-troop-withdrawal.html" title="">troops from several African countries</a>. Some 350 French troops are in Gabon, but Mr. Nguema has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3zdHXhNJOE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, “I’m not chasing anyone out.” </p><p>Paul Modoss, a 35-year-old entrepreneur, said on Friday that he would vote for Mr. Nguema because he had united the country and embodied renewal. “You can’t call President Brice Oligui Nguema a dictator,” he said. “A dictator doesn’t return power to the people through the ballot box.”</p><p>His most serious opponent is Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nze, who was Mr. Bongo’s prime minister. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nze, a former prime minister of Gabon, campaigning in Lambarene on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luc Gnago/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Bilie-By-Nze, 57, has vowed to break with Gabon’s pre-coup political system, dismantle its network and reduce French influence, even though he long operated within that system. </p><p>He has also called Mr. Nguema’s potential election a threat to democracy and said he wants to diversify Gabon’s economy and reduce its dependence on oil revenues. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Lauréa Mamboundou, a 26-year-old law student, said she would vote for Mr. Bilie-By-Nze for his political experience.</p><p>“He is the most competent candidate today, but also the one who would be the easiest to sanction with our votes should he ever betray the people’s trust,” she said. “This is a guarantee against the drift we all fear.”</p><h2 id="link-60ea1bab">What are the main issues? </h2><p>Gabon is rich in mineral resources. It holds a quarter of the world’s reserves of manganese, a mineral used to produce steel. But its economy remains overly dependent on oil, which accounts for 38 percent of Gabon’s gross domestic product. </p><p>The country is among the world’s most corrupt countries, according to the watchdog <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/countries/gabon" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Transparency International</a>. Over 40 percent of young people in Gabon are unemployed. And a third of its 2.5 million people live on less than $5.50 a day, according to the World Bank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Under Mr. Nguema’s leadership, the interim authorities adopted a new Constitution that allows members of the military to run for office. It also limits a president to two seven-year terms.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A campaign banner for Mr. Nguema in Libreville, Gabon, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luc Gnago/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Siegel said the general had borrowed from the playbook of another Central African country, Chad, whose leader<span>  </span>seized power when his father was killed in 2021, and who was later declared winner in an election.</p><p>Mr. Bilie-By-Nze said Mr. Nguema had flouted electoral rules by using state funds to finance his campaign, while other candidate received no such state support. “The junta’s leader has tailored a Constitution and an electoral law to his own needs to confiscate power,” Mr. Bilie-By-Nze said in a statement.<span>  </span></p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Nguema declined to comment.</p><h2 id="link-58dfe8a8">A region full of aging leaders</h2><p>Several Central African countries are ruled by authoritarian leaders, including Africa’s top three longest-serving presidents. Two are Gabon’s neighbors: the president<span>  </span>of Cameroon has been in power for 42 years and the president<span>  </span>of the Republic of Congo has held office for 38 years. </p><p>In Gabon, the two leading candidates have a long history with the Bongo family but have tried to distance themselves from it. Each has accused the other of being the candidate of the old regime. </p><h2 id="link-50b5d630">When will the results be announced?</h2><p>About 860,000 people are expected to go to the polls on Saturday. The results are expected to be announced before April 16.</p><p>Yann Leyimangoye contributed reporting from Libreville, Gabon.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Saikou Jammeh is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Dakar, Senegal.</p></div><div><p>Elian Peltier is The Times’ West Africa correspondent, based in Dakar, Senegal.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
