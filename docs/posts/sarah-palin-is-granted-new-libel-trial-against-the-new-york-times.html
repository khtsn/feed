Ms. Palin said the editorial had damaged her reputation, even though The Times had swiftly corrected and <a href="https://x.com/nytopinion/status/875377356944396290?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apologized for</a> the piece.</p><p>A federal jury in New York City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/business/media/new-york-times.html" title="">ruled for</a> The Times. Ms. Palin appealed, arguing in part that the judge hearing the case had wrongly excluded evidence. She also argued that the jury may have been swayed when the judge announced that he planned to throw out the lawsuit even as the jury was continuing to deliberate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The three-judge appeals panel in New York sided with Ms. Palin, saying the trial judge, Jed S. Rakoff, had made a number of errors that “impugn the reliability” of the verdict. The appeals court called for a new trial.</p><p>“Governor Palin is very happy with today’s decision, which is a significant step forward in the process of holding publishers accountable for content that misleads readers and the public in general,” Shane Vogt, Ms. Palin’s lawyer, said.</p><p>“This decision is disappointing,” Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesman for The Times, said. “We’re confident we will prevail in a retrial.”</p><p>As a politician, Ms. Palin often made media-bashing part of her rhetoric. Her lawsuit — as well as the 10-day trial in February 2022 — put her toe to toe with one of the country’s most prominent mainstream news organizations.</p><p>The case was also freighted with extra significance because Ms. Palin’s lawyers hoped to use it as a vehicle to overturn the Supreme Court’s landmark First Amendment decision in New York Times v. Sullivan. That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/10/archives/text-of-the-supreme-courts-opinion-in-libel-case-against-the-new.html" title="">1964 ruling</a>, as well as a handful of subsequent cases, has made it much harder for public figures like Ms. Palin to win libel lawsuits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While many view the Sullivan decision as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/reader-center/libel-law-explainer.html" title="">a linchpin</a> of the free press, a growing chorus of mostly conservative critics, including Justice Clarence Thomas, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/us/supreme-court-libel.html" title="">have argued</a> in recent years that the precedent unfairly shields news organizations from accountability when they harm people’s reputations.</p><p>The appeals court’s 56-page ruling on Wednesday did not engage with the argument by Ms. Palin’s side that the Sullivan precedent was obsolete. Instead, the three judges — all appointed by Republican presidents — faulted Judge Rakoff’s handling of the trial. (In 2019, the same appeals court reversed his decision to dismiss the lawsuit before trial.)</p><p>Among other things, the appeals panel said Judge Rakoff had improperly prevented jurors from hearing evidence that might have shown that James Bennet, who at the time oversaw The Times’s editorial board and edited the piece in question, knew or should have known that Ms. Palin did not incite the 2011 shooting in Tucson, Ariz.</p><p>That rampage, which left six people dead and gravely wounded a Democratic congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, came after Ms. Palin’s political action committee published a map with cross hairs over several Democrat-controlled congressional districts, including Ms. Giffords’s. The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/us/gunman-who-shot-giffords-to-be-sentenced.html" title="">later found</a> to have severe mental illness, and no evidence emerged that he had been motivated by politics.</p><p>Mr. Bennet’s state of mind matters because under the Sullivan precedent, a public figure can prevail in a libel lawsuit only if she proves that a publisher acted with “actual malice,” meaning that the publisher knew that what was written was false or acted with reckless disregard about the statement’s accuracy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Bennet, who left The Times in 2020, said at the trial that he had not intended to convey in the editorial that the map had caused the shooting.</p><p>The appeals court concluded that Judge Rakoff could preside over the retrial. “We are confident that the district judge will adhere to the principle of complete impartiality, and its appearance, in fulfilling his future judicial responsibilities in this case,” the three judges wrote.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Enrich is the business investigations editor for The Times.
