The team said he had struggled for years with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the degenerative disease of the nervous system more commonly known as A.L.S. or Lou Gehrig’s disease.</p><p>McMichael played 15 years in the N.F.L., 13 of them with Chicago and none more rapacious than the 1985 season. The Bears lost only once that season while rampaging through the league with the so-called 46 defense, orchestrated by the team’s boisterous defensive coordinator, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/sports/football/buddy-ryan-dies-nfl.html" title="">Buddy Ryan</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>McMichael during the National Football Conference championship game against the Los Angeles Rams at Soldier Field in Chicago on Jan. 12, 1986.

No victory was more thorough than the Bears’ 44-0 dismantling of the Dallas Cowboys on their own field on Nov. 17, 1985. It was the worst defeat in the team’s then-26-year history.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That afternoon, McMichael collected one of the 92 ½ career sacks he accumulated with the Bears, placing him second in franchise history to his teammate Richard Dent. In the view of many, Dallas simply gave up. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/13/sports/tom-landry-is-dead-at-75-innovative-coach-of-cowboys.html" title="">Tom Landry</a>, Dallas’s coach at the time, called the defeat “an old-fashioned country licking.”</p><p>“I call it the piranha effect,” the Chicago defensive end Dan Hampton told reporters afterward. “We start getting on somebody and we smell blood. We seem to go into a frenzy.”</p><p>Chicago’s only loss that season came against the Miami Dolphins. The Bears dominated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX, 46-10, played on Jan. 26, 1986, in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.</p><p>Though somewhat small for a defensive lineman at 6 feet 2 inches and 270 pounds, McMichael possessed immense strength and slippery quickness. He starred on a defense that included three other future Hall of Famers: the defensive ends Hampton and Dent and the linebacker Mike Singletary. He played in 191 consecutive games for the Bears and 12 more in the playoffs, a franchise record.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“He was a defensive tackle taking on double teams and triple teams and leg whips and this and that,” Hampton told The Chicago Tribune for its obituary about McMichael. “To then essentially defy the physical reality of it is mind-boggling.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>McMichael in 1984 during his third season with the Bears.

His nicknames included Ming the Merciless, after the tyrant in “Flash Gordon,” and Mongo, after the dimwitted ruffian who punches out a horse in the Mel Brooks comedy “Blazing Saddles.”</p><p>In a 2019 speech recounted by <a href="https://www.kktv.com/2025/04/23/chicago-bears-great-steve-mongo-mcmichael-dies-67-after-battle-with-als/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a> in its obituary, McMichael joked that his brief and inconsequential stay with the Patriots, who had chosen him in the third round of the 1980 N.F.L. draft, ended after a season because he was considered “the criminal element in the league.”</p><p>But the Bears readily accepted him in 1981. McMichael described walking into the office of the Bears’ founder, George Halas, and being told: “I’ve heard what kind of dirty rat you are in practice. Don’t change, Steve.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>McMichael in 1996.

His parents divorced when he was a year old. His mother, an English teacher born Betty Ruth Smalley, later married E.V. McMichael, an oil company executive. Steve, who took his stepfather’s last name as a toddler, declined to discuss his surname at birth. His mother died of breast cancer in 2018, and his stepfather died after being shot in 1976.</p><p>In 1964, the family moved to tiny Freer, Texas, south of San Antonio. McMichael lettered in football, baseball, basketball, track, tennis and golf at Freer High School. </p><p>He played football at <a href="https://texaslonghorns.com/news/2025/4/23/football-longhorn-legend-steve-mcmichael-passes-away.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the University of Texas</a>, where he was an All-American in 1979. In 2010, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. In the N.F.L., he was named All-Pro in 1985 and 1987.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He is survived by his wife, Misty (Davenport) McMichael; a daughter, Macy McMichael; two sisters, Kathy and Sharon McMichael; and a brother, Robert. His first marriage, to Debra Marshall in 1998, ended in divorce.</p><p>In 2020, McMichael began experiencing tingling in his arms. A year later, he was diagnosed with A.L.S. He kept his humor when he revealed his illness to The Chicago Tribune in April 2021, saying that it “will sneak up on you like a cheap-shotting Green Bay Packer.”</p><p>As the disease progressed, McMichael lost the ability to move and to speak.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>McMichael was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2024, but he was too ill to attend the ceremony.
