Putin of Russia had ordered the cease-fire was met swiftly with skepticism by Ukrainian officials.</p><p>“There is no reason to wait until May 8,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/mi-cinuyemo-zhittya-lyudej-ne-paradi-zvernennya-prezidenta-97417" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in his nightly address</a>, calling the announcement “another attempt at manipulation” amid the Trump administration’s push for an end to the war.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky noted that Ukraine had already agreed, at the urging of the United States, to an unconditional 30-day cease-fire — but that Russia had not. Nor did Russia agree to halt strikes on civilian targets, he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Russia has consistently rejected everything and continues to manipulate the world, trying to deceive the United States,” said Mr. Zelensky, who has accused Mr. Putin of playing for time in cease-fire negotiations to strengthen his hand.</p><p>If Russia truly wants a cease-fire, Mr. Zelensky added, “it must be immediate, full and unconditional — for at least 30 days to ensure it is secure and guaranteed.” He also said that “the cease-fire should not be just for a few days, only to return to killing afterward.”</p><p>The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, brushed off that suggestion on Tuesday by saying that Moscow would not agree to a longer cease-fire without hammering out more details.</p><p>“Details matter if you’re talking about a lengthy cease-fire: It would be difficult to agree to such a lengthy cease-fire without addressing those issues,” Mr. Peskov told Russian news agencies.</p><p>Apparently seeking to counter the notion that Russia was stonewalling Mr. Trump’s peace efforts, Mr. Peskov also reiterated what he said was Russia’s offer to hold direct talks with Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Peskov said Russia was prepared to talk to Mr. Zelensky’s government even though it considers him an illegitimate president, as elections have been suspended in Ukraine under martial law.</p><p>“Indeed, there are legal issues related to legitimacy,” Mr. Peskov said. “But in this case, the interest in entering into peace settlement processes is above all else.”</p><p>His comments came as Ukraine’s Air Force said it had shot down 37 of the drones Russian forces launched overnight. Nine drones were downed in the Kyiv region, the local authorities said, where falling debris caused injuries and started a fire at a hotel.</p><p>In the Dnipro region, a drone attack killed a 12-year-old girl. A 6-year-old girl and two adults were also wounded, according to the local authorities.</p><p>The Kremlin’s announcement about the temporary truce came shortly after President Trump expressed frustration with Russia’s continued bombardment of Ukraine. After meeting with Mr. Zelensky over the weekend, Mr. Trump said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/27/us/trump-news?smid=url-share#trump-says-putin-may-not-want-peace-and-may-need-to-be-dealt-with-differently" title="">he questioned</a> whether Mr. Putin truly wanted peace.</p><p>“Maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently,” Mr. Trump wrote in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114404524335638236" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a>.</p><p>Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> and <!-- -->Anton Troianovski<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Varenikova covers Ukraine and its war with Russia.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Reliance on Drones: </strong>Should the peace talks fail, or the United States discontinue arms shipments, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-drones.html">the Ukrainian drone initiative</a> is likely to take on more importance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Putin Thanks Kim:</strong><strong> </strong>Moscow and Pyongyang<strong> </strong>confirmed that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/asia/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine.html">North Korean troops have been fighting shoulder to shoulder with Russia’s,</a> saying they had helped liberate the Kursk border region from Ukrainian forces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deadly Car Blast</strong><strong>: </strong>An explosion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/russian-officer-explosion-moscow-ukraine.html">killed a senior Russian military officer</a> in a Moscow suburb, investigators said, the latest in a series of apparent assassinations targeting Ukraine’s opponents inside Russia.</p></li><li><p><strong>Europe’s Choices if America Walks Away</strong><strong>: </strong>Europeans see Ukraine’s security as vital to their own and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/europe/europe-ukraine-russia-trump.html">want to defend the principle of no border changes by force</a>, even if President Trump does not.</p></li><li><p><strong>Air Raids and Antidepressants:</strong><strong> </strong>Sleep deprivation has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/ukraine-sleep-deprivation-russia-war.html">a health crisis</a> in Ukraine, experts and psychologists say.
