<p>Price of Bitcoin over the past year</p>
</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The election results are poised to cause more volatility. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s price fell 7 percent to roughly $68,000 as the betting odds shifted to give Mr. Trump a <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024/will-donald-trump-win-the-2024-us-presidential-election?tid=1730757891346" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">narrower lead</a> over Vice President Kamala Harris. Many crypto investors are hoping the price could rebound this week.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We expect Bitcoin to break all-time highs on a Trump win,” the investment management and research firm Bernstein said in a report on Monday, predicting that the digital currency could rise as high as $80,000 or $90,000. But if Ms. Harris wins, the report said, Bitcoin’s price could fall as low as $50,000.</p><p>The election Tuesday is easily the most important political event in crypto’s history. For the first time, the industry’s leading companies have mobilized to invest enormous sums, funding a network of super PACs that have spent tens of millions of dollars in key congressional races. The results could determine whether crypto companies flourish in the United States, or end up decamping to other countries in the face of a regulatory crackdown in Washington.</p><p>The market for Bitcoin and other digital assets is known for its rapid swings. Early this year, Bitcoin’s price climbed after the federal government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/technology/sec-bitcoin-approval-exchange-traded-funds.html" title="">allowed</a> traditional financial firms to offer a new investment vehicle directly tied to the Bitcoin market. The new products, a type of exchange traded funds, were a hit on Wall Street and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/technology/bitcoin-etf-trading.html#:~:text=etf%2Dtrading.html-,%244%20Billion%20of%20New%20Bitcoin%20Funds%20Change%20Hands%20in%20First,moment%20for%20the%20crypto%20industry." title="">attracted</a> billions of dollars. In March, Bitcoin reached a record price of $73,750.07, according to CoinMarketCap, a website that tracks crypto prices.</p><p>Since then, the 2024 U.S. election has emerged as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/technology/-crypto-influence-election.html" title="">pivotal</a> moment for crypto. The Biden administration has aggressively pursued crypto companies for violating federal securities rules, bringing lawsuits against the Coinbase exchange and other large U.S. firms. In response, much of the industry has thrown its support behind Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic who <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57392734" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dismissed</a> Bitcoin as “a scam.” But as crypto companies began donating large sums to influence the election, he warmed to the industry, promising to end the government’s crackdown.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This summer, Mr. Trump spoke at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville and vowed to turn the United States into “the crypto capital of the planet.” He also started his own crypto business, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/donald-trump-crypto-2024-campaign.html" title="">World Liberty Financial</a>, and aggressively promoted it on social media.</p><p>In the run-up to the election, a set of super PACs financed by the crypto industry has spent more than $100 million to influence congressional races across the country. The aim is to install the most pro-crypto Congress in history — legislators who would advance the industry’s agenda in Washington and stop the Securities and Exchange Commission from pursuing crypto companies.</p><p>The political spending appears to have influenced both parties. In recent days, Ms. Harris has made <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/23/harris-embraces-crypto-overture-young-men" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overtures to the crypto industry</a>, suggesting that she would also adopt a softer approach to regulation.</p><p>Still, Mr. Trump “is seen as the pro-crypto candidate,” the Bernstein analysts wrote, while Ms. Harris is expected to continue the “hawkish crypto stance” of the Biden administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Yaffe-Bellany writes about the crypto industry from San Francisco.
