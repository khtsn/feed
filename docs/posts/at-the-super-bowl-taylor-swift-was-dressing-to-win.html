For her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/chiefs-vs-eagles-live-updates-super-bowl-score-result/64HSxCskWoem/" title="">Super Bowl LIX</a> appearance, Taylor Swift, in New Orleans to support her boyfriend Travis Kelce, matched her game-day ’fit to the Chiefs’ game-day uniform.</p><p>Dropping her usual Kansas City red, she opted for a double-breasted white Saint Laurent blazer over a pair of bedazzled Daisy Dukes and a white Alaïa bodysuit, with thigh-high white stiletto boots.</p><p>All of that white immediately had some online <a href="https://www.instyle.com/taylor-swift-white-blazer-2025-super-bowl-outfit-8788459" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speculating</a> that Ms. Swift was having a bridal moment and preparing to get engaged (not to mention unexpectedly matching the all-white Akris outfit of Ivanka Trump, who accompanied her father to the game). A more likely explanation is that Ms. Swift was simply coordinating with the white away jerseys of the Chiefs, just like Britney Mahomes. Instead of a red number on her back, Ms. Swift carried a cherry-red Givenchy handbag and wore the ruby red Lorraine Schwartz “T” necklace she had draped around her thigh at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/style/grammys-red-carpet-2025-photos.html" title="">Grammys</a>. (For Travis? For Taylor? Maybe both.)</p><p>As a result, it was hard not to think that, in the game of fan fashion, she was dressing to win.</p><p>The blazer and boots were fully in line with what increasingly seems like Ms. Swift’s uniform as chief Chiefs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/style/super-bowl-nfl-wives-party.html" title="">WAG</a>. Over the last season she has become more and more comfortable turning game days into catwalks, matching the tunnel walk of Mr. Kelce with entrance-making looks of her own. As Mr. Kelce said during a recent pre-Super Bowl news conference, “Tay’s always gonna be dressed head-to-toe, looking the flyest.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Early on in their relationship, Ms. Taylor wore mostly fan gear, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/style/kristin-juszczyk-super-bowl-nfl.html" title="">the customized Chiefs jacket</a> with Mr. Kelce’s number that was designed by her fellow WAG <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/style/emma-grede-kristin-juszczyk-off-season.html" title="">Kristin Juszczyk</a> (wife of 49er Kyle). But this season Ms. Swift’s stylist, Joseph Cassell, who worked with her on the Eras Tour, has been involved in creating her game-day style. Which, not surprisingly, started to look pointedly similar to her late-stage <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/style/taylor-swift-eras-tour-looks.html" title="">Eras style</a> (unlike, say, her early fairy princess style or her pandemic flowy folk style).</p><p>Heavy on the corsets, shorts and boots, her football kit suggests that she decided to give up attempting to disguise herself as just any old fan, and doing so underscores the fact she is one half of a quasi-royal couple, who brings a power base all her own. Whether you like it or not, it’s clearly her on-show comfort zone.</p><p>And, really, what single show is watched by as many people as the Super Bowl? Her appearance is as much a performance as any she officially performs.</p><p>Indeed, since last September Ms. Swift has modeled so many luxury labels in various N.F.L. suites that they have turned into a veritable Avenue Montaigne.</p><p>In the September 2024 kickoff game, she wore a denim Versace corset with matching denim Grlfrnd cutoffs and thigh-high patent leather Giuseppe Zanotti boots. The next month she sported (no pun intended) an off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood minidress with platform boots. In November, she was in another corset — a black Victoria’s Secret number — and more Versace (this time a chief’s red and black checkered miniskirt suit).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In January, during the playoffs, she wore a Chanel romper with a Chanel pearl belt, bouclé jacket and quilted Chanel bag. And for the A.F.C. championship game, it was a Louis Vuitton logo-bedecked jacket, beanie, gloves, bag and boots.</p><p>In other words, whether or not a proposal actually happens after the Super Bowl, fashion and football have clearly pledged their troth.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vanessa Friedman has been the fashion director and chief fashion critic for The Times since 2014.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vanessa-friedman">More about Vanessa Friedman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/travis-kelce">Travis Kelce</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
