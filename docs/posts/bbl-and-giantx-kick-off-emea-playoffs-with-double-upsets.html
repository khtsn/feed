</span>. Both of the perceived underdogs took wins to move on to the upper semifinals to face the number one seeded teams.</p>



<p>In their second outing against FNATIC this year, BBL <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/429385/fnatic-vs-bbl-esports-champions-tour-2025-emea-kickoff-ubqf" target="_blank">once again</a> came out on top with a 2-1 victory over the reigning EMEA champions. Having already qualified to Champions, there was less at stake for FNATIC, but their map pool has been showing signs of weakness since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. For BBL, this win brings them one step closer to Champions qualification. One more win will take them into the top four and give them at least an extra three Championship points, giving them a great chance at qualification. To get there however, they will have to take on <span data-ref-id="4">

</span>, currently looking in form as the best team in EMEA.</p>

<p>On map one, FNATIC opted to pick Corrode, showcasing the map for the first time in the team&#39;s history. On the new map, with a unique Vyse and Astra comp, FNATIC started with a hot 5-0 start, capitalizing on some missteps from BBL. However, they lost the following anti-eco round when <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> ran out of time in the clutch. This was one of three rounds that FNATIC lost due to the clock on their attack side, a symptom of their slow style that they live and die by. With their eco win, BBL completely swung the momentum and tied the score at 6-6 at the half.</p>

<p>On the defense sided Corrode though, six rounds wasn&#39;t nearly enough for BBL, and especially not when <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span> finds an ace and 4k on the pistol and bonus respectively. These two rounds let FNATIC easily coast to a 13-7 victory.</p>



<p><em>kaajak all but wins the map on his own.</em></p>

<p>Next was BBL&#39;s map pick, where they chose Ascent, a map where FNATIC have been struggling recently. In their last outing, they got <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/511573/team-liquid-vs-fnatic-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-w4/?game=226494&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">thrashed</a> by <span data-ref-id="7">

</span> in a 13-1 loss, exposing the weaknesses in their Chamber composition. Taking advantage of these faults, BBL felt in control throughout the whole map. With great utility combinations between their three initiators, they had great success with site hits on the attack, and were constantly disrupting FNATIC&#39;s early round plans on defense. Adding on top a great performance from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20144/lewn">
		LewN	</a>
</span> on Jett, and BBL took a convincing 13-7 map win of their own.</p>

<p>For the final map of Haven, FNATIC pulled out a brand new comp for them, for the first time switching off of the Yoru Iso comp that they pioneered. Now with kaajak on Neon, they finally had some pace on their attack side, differing from their usual slow style. Despite a 1v3 from Magnum in the pistol round, FNATIC started the map hot, with kaajak winning the round two eco off of two nasty sheriff shots. They then pedaled up to an 8-4 half, with Boaster proving to be a thorn in BBL&#39;s side. However, come the second half, BBL came alive. Eight rounds in a row they took, abusing FNATIC&#39;s weaker site holds. After <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span> clawed back one round, BBL closed out the map 13-9 to complete the upset.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="10">

<p>Despite claiming the number two seed in group Alpha, GIANTX was generally not expected to do damage in playoffs. Much more respect was given to NAVI, who had seemed the more consistent team, only being bested by the likes of Team Liquid and FNATIC. However, GIANTX showed up big today, taking a 2-1 victory to move on to face Team Liquid themselves. The path to Champions is long and rough for GIANTX, but they intend to keep fighting for it.</p>

<p>The first map of this matchup was a complete wash in NAVI&#39;s favor. On their map pick, they completely outclassed GIANTX. Everyone on NAVI was firing on all cylinders, including <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/109/ange1">
		ANGE1	</a>
</span>, who went 7-0 against the opposing duelist <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11332/ara">
		ara	</a>
</span> in the head-to-head. GIANTX only mustered three defense rounds, with most of their attempts at early aggression getting completely shut down. NAVI took a 9-3 lead at the half, then closed it out not much later 13-5.</p>

<p>Not going down without a fight, GIANTX woke up on their map pick of Haven. They immediately started out with a pistol round win to get things going for them early. NAVI quickly responded back to tie the game at 2-2, but GIANTX pulled ahead off the back of some big individual plays and clutches. The two teams then went back and forth for the last five rounds, ending the half with a 7-5 score in favor of GIANTX.</p>


<p><em>Some crispy Sheriff flicks from <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/34684/westside">
		westside	</a>
</span></em></p>

<p>GIANTX started the second half with another pistol win, giving them a four round lead. NAVI fought back with a couple of rounds, but GIANTX eventually managed to string together three straight rounds to close out the map 13-8. ara put up a nuclear performance, going 28-10 on the map with a 1.81 rating as the series moved to the final map.</p>


<p><em>An aggressive set play melts NAVI in seconds.</em></p>

<p>Riding the momentum from Haven, GIANTX came into Ascent completely in control. They once again started the map with a pistol round, and once NAVI let the bonus round slip, GIANTX were cruising. A big clutch from <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5550/grubinho">
		grubinho	</a>
</span> let them push their lead up to 6-0, putting NAVI in dire straits.</p>


<p><em>Despite the best efforts of <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/384/shao">
		Shao	</a>
</span>, NAVI can&#39;t find their first round.</em></p>

<p>Some mistakes from GIANTX let NAVI get their first and second round, but they struggled to find any other wins. They only managed to get their third round at the very end of the half, with a messy clutch from ANGE1. 9-3 was the score at the half, leaving NAVI with a major comeback needed to stay alive.</p>

<p>NAVI were given an injection of hope in the second half by finding a flawless pistol round, but weren&#39;t able to push it any further when they lost the bonus round. That hope was even further dashed when ara won a 1v2 the round after. Yet another clutch from grubinho gave GIANTX match point, and they soon closed out the map 13-6 to win the series.</p>


<p><em>ara shatters NAVI&#39;s chances of a comeback.</em></p>
