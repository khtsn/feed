    <h1>Trump’s Advisers Battle Over Tariff Goals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump is planning to gather his cabinet in the Rose Garden this week to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/31/us/trump-tariffs-news" title="">announce a sweeping plan for global tariffs</a> that he promised would correct decades of unfair trade relationships and stop other countries from “ripping off” the U.S. He has taken to referring to Wednesday, when the tariffs are set to be unveiled, as “Liberation Day.”</p><p>It remains unclear, however, whether Trump’s plan will result in higher levies on other nations, lower ones, or a mix — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/tariffs-estimates-consumers.html" title="">or what exactly his goal is</a>. Many economists expect Americans will pay higher prices, and investors also appear uncertain about the economic impact of the plan: The S&amp;P 500 rose slightly today, but finished March with its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/business/stocks-nikkei-sp500.html" title="">worst monthly decline in more than two years</a>.</p><p>Trump has described the tariffs as a negotiating tool that could force other countries to drop their trade barriers, ultimately resulting in lower tariffs. But he has also talked about the tariffs as a way to raise revenue and shift supply chains back to the U.S., which would be a result of sustained higher tariffs. The president’s supporters have pushed both conflicting goals, but ultimately the president will decide a path forward.</p><p>Trump and his allies have occasionally acknowledged that the tariffs would likely, at least temporarily, impose additional costs on consumers. They are hoping to sell the public on a provocative idea: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/business/trump-tariffs-higher-prices.html" title="">Cheap stuff is not the American dream</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thibaud Moritz/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2b21a729">France’s far-right leader was barred from running for office</h2><p>Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far right, was found guilty today of embezzlement for overseeing a scheme to pay her party’s staff with money intended for E.U. business. The verdict <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/europe/france-marine-le-pen-embezzlement-2027-election-ban.html" title="">barred her from running for public office for five years</a> — effectively removing the front-runner from France’s 2027 presidential race.</p><p>Le Pen has denied any wrongdoing, but she will be able to run in 2027 only if she secures a more lenient ruling on appeal, which is difficult but not impossible. Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s 29-year-old protégé, will be a likely presidential candidate in her absence.</p><p><strong>An analysis: </strong>Millions of Le Pen’s supporters are now adrift and angry, our Paris bureau chief Roger Cohen explained.
