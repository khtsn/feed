Israeli officials have said the blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from being smuggled into the enclave.</p><p>The blockade has remained in place during the 20 months of war that have followed a deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. Israel recently also barred the entry of humanitarian aid into the territory for roughly 80 days, bringing the population to the brink of famine, according to international aid organizations. It has since supported an aid delivery system that has been marred by violence and shunned by humanitarian groups.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The voyage of the Madleen was only the latest attempt by activists to breach the Gaza blockade.</p><p>A ship called Conscience left Tunisia in late April carrying humanitarian aid for Gaza.

The passengers and crew were not harmed, but the mission was abandoned.</p><p>In 2010, nine passengers aboard the Mavi Marmara, part of a flotilla carrying aid from Turkey to Gaza, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/world/middleeast/01flotilla.html" title="">killed in an Israeli commando raid</a>, causing international outrage and damaging Turkish-Israeli relations. A 10th passenger died from his wounds years later.</p><p>Israel said at the time that its soldiers, some of whom had rappelled onto the ship from helicopters, came under ambush and were attacked with clubs, metal rods and knives.</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Rehovot, Israel, and Jiawei Wang from Seoul.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.</p></div><div><p>Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter, based in Washington.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
