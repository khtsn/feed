Under moonlight, the six men shuffled to the village church.</p><p>There a priest led them in a whispered prayer, his voice barely audible over the sound of crashing waves; the tide was high that day. Saltwater pooled in parts of the village, which is on Fanalei Island, an ever-shrinking speck of land that is part of the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific.</p><p>They paddled out in wooden canoes before first light, cutting through the darkness until they were miles away from shore. After hours of scanning the horizon, one of the hunters, Lesley Fugui, saw a fin slice the glassy water. He raised a 10-foot-long bamboo pole with a piece of cloth tied to the end, alerting the others of his discovery. Then he made a phone call to his wife. He had found dolphins. The hunt would begin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/00solomon-dolphins-04-mkzp/00solomon-dolphins-04-mkzp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/00solomon-dolphins-04-mkzp/00solomon-dolphins-04-mkzp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/00solomon-dolphins-04-mkzp/00solomon-dolphins-04-mkzp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An aerial view of a small island, lush with greenery, surrounded by a body of water.

Some conservationists say the slaughter is cruel and unnecessary. But for the 130 or so residents of Fanalei, the traditional hunt has taken on renewed urgency as climate change threatens their home. They say they need the dolphins for their lucrative teeth, which are used as local currency, to buy land on higher ground and escape their sinking home.</p><p>Each tooth fetches 3 Solomon Islands dollars (roughly $0.36) — a price set by the chiefs of Fanalei — and a single hunt of around 200 dolphins can bring in tens of thousands of dollars, more than any other economic activity on the island.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“We feel sorry, too, for killing the dolphins, but we don’t really have a choice,” Mr. Fugui said.

The once fertile land has been ruined by encroaching saltwater. The government has promoted seaweed farming as a source of income, while overseas conservation groups have offered cash to end the hunts. But the ocean remains both an existential threat and the villagers’ most profitable resource. Government research suggests the island could be underwater by the end of the century.</p><p>“For a low-lying island like ours, we witness with our own eyes how sea rise is affecting our lives,” said Wilson Filei, the head chief of Fanalei.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Over time, dolphin teeth have allowed the villagers to pay for a new church, a sea wall and an extension to the local primary school.</p><p>During the hunting season, which runs from January through April, people here can kill up to a thousand dolphins, but the hunters say that the weather is becoming increasingly unpredictable, making it harder for them to locate and trap a pod.</p><p>While dolphin meat is eaten and bartered with neighboring islands for food, betel nuts and other products, the teeth are the true prize of the hunt. They are used for cultural activities, and families of prospective grooms buy them by the hundreds to give to a woman during a traditional bride price ceremony.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-14"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/00solomon-dolphins-09-mkzp/00solomon-dolphins-09-mkzp-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/11/multimedia/00solomon-dolphins-09-mkzp/00solomon-dolphins-09-mkzp-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/12/135646_1_00solomons-dolphins-supply-boat_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A supply ship carrying passengers, food and other essential goods arrives at Fanalei, drawing villagers from across the region and temporarily tripling the island’s population.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A supply ship typically arrives every two weeks, drawing villagers who offload the goods and transport them to the island.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matthew Abbott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dolphin teeth necklaces for sale at a market in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In recent years, most villagers have fled to a neighboring island. They continue to hunt dolphins from there, saying they need to buy more land to house those left behind and support their growing population.</p><p>Dolphin hunting is a community affair in Fanalei. When Mr. Fugui raised his flag that morning, he set off a cacophony of delight. Children climbed trees to watch the hunters and cheered “kirio” — dolphin in the local Lau language — so that every resident would know that the hunt had started. Men in canoes hanging close to shore broke through the waves into the open ocean to help the hunters form a semicircle around the dolphins and corral them to land.</p><p>The teeth, once collected, are shared among every family according to a strict tier system: The hunters get the largest share (“first prize”); married men who didn’t participate get the next largest portion; and the remaining teeth are divided among widows, orphans and other households without a male representative.</p><p>Village leaders also set aside a portion of the teeth in what they call a “community basket” for major works. One day, they hope this will include the purchase of land to expand a resettlement village on the larger South Malaita Island. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Playing soccer on a narrow strip of sand, exposed only at low tide.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Altar boys preparing in the back of Fouele church before a Sunday service.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Building a new house on Fanalei Island.

After spotting the dolphins, Mr. Fugui and the other hunters started beating fist-size rocks under the water to drive the pod toward the shore.

The dolphins scattered and the men returned empty-handed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Halfway through this year’s season, there was only one successful hunt in Solomon Islands, where a village near Fanalei killed over 300 dolphins.</p><p>Experts say it’s unclear whether dolphin hunting is sustainable. Rochelle Constantine, a marine biologist who teaches at the University of Auckland, and Kabini Afia, a climate and environmental researcher from the Solomon Islands, said that some of the more commonly hunted species appear to have healthy populations. But the effects of the hunt are still unclear on more coastal and smaller dolphins.</p><p>For the people of Fanalei, the more pressing question isn’t the future of the dolphins — it’s their own survival in the face of rising seas.</p><p>“Dolphin hunting may be our identity,” Mr. Fugui said, “but our lives and the lives of our children — that’s what’s important.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-33"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/18/world/00solomons-dolphins-binoculars-watch-cover/00solomons-dolphins-binoculars-watch-cover-superJumbo.png" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/18/world/00solomons-dolphins-binoculars-watch-cover/00solomons-dolphins-binoculars-watch-cover-superJumbo.png" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/03/19/136072_1_solomon-dolphons-beach-binoculars3_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Watching a hunt from a beach.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></section></article></div></div></div>
