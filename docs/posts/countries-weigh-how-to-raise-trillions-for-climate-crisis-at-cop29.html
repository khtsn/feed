How much? From where?

The election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States all but guarantees that the world’s richest country will not chip in. (Mr. Trump has said he would withdraw from the global climate accord altogether, as he did during his first term.)</p><p>So now what?</p><p>Several creative ideas are circulating to raise money for countries to invest in renewable energy and adapt to the dangers of climate change. They include levying taxes, tackling debt and pushing international development banks to do more, faster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The new proposals come with steep hurdles of their own, but the traditional way of raising money — passing around the hat and asking donor countries to make pledges — has failed to meet the need.</p><p>The last time a climate finance goal was established, in 2009, rich countries promised to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020. They were two years late in meeting that target, and about 70 percent of the money came as loans, infuriating already heavily indebted countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the Baku climate talks, known as COP29, negotiators aim to set a new climate finance target.

Without a large money pledge, emerging economies may well balk at demands to clean up their climate pollution more quickly, which would ultimately harm the citizens of rich countries.</p><p>“Let’s dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity,” the United Nations’ climate agency leader, Simon Stiell, said on Monday. “An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the developing world, anger is mounting. Last year, low-income countries shelled out <a href="https://unctad.org/publication/world-of-debt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an estimated $847 billion</a> on interest payments alone, far exceeding funds they received from developed countries for climate finance.</p><p>Rajiv Shah, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said wealthier countries must find new ways to invest “at a scale that helps developing economies begin climate transitions that can better lives and prevent climate change’s worst.”</p><p>Here’s what’s on the table as countries <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-thwaites/getting-here-there-scaling-climate-finance-ncqg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hunt for new money</a>.</p><h3 id="link-3357c467"><span><strong>Taxing the problem</strong></span></h3><p>The simplest formula is a global price on carbon.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines invoked it after a hurricane hit this year. There’s pressure on the International Monetary Fund to expand a similar mechanism.</p><p>Then there’s debt relief in exchange for protecting nature: Development banks back a new loan with friendlier terms. In exchange, the country commits to conservation or climate projects, like restoring coral reefs, as Belize <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/world/americas/belize-coral-reef-preservation.html" title="">did recently</a>. Although such deals have been criticized for not reducing costs enough for developing countries, a <a href="https://www.debtfornature.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coalition of nonprofits</a> aims to scale up the deals to create $100 billion in funding.</p><h3 id="link-78f15a55"><span><strong>Supercharging development banks</strong></span></h3><p>Lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have been under pressure to offer much more money as grants and low-interest loans. That requires the banks’ donor countries to pony up more money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Bank is currently taking pledges to <a href="https://ida.worldbank.org/en/replenishments/road-to-IDA21" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replenish the pot of money</a> it uses to dispense aid to the poorest nations.

It’s not clear how the current round will shake out.</p><p>“The most important thing is long-term cheap finance,” said Kevin Gallagher, a climate finance expert at Boston University.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund has another card to play: a financial instrument called “special drawing rights,” which are allocated to the Fund’s members and can be redeemed for cash. In the wake of the pandemic, the I.M.F. allowed countries in need to dip into the unused funds. Advocates say those reserves could provide at least <a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/beyond-crises-the-future-of-special-drawing-rights-as-a-source-of-development-a-621605/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$200 billion a year</a> for climate resilience. The governing board of the I.M.F. has not agreed to go that far.</p><h3 id="link-406bcf54"><span><strong>Nudging private investment</strong></span></h3><p>Private investors supply nearly as much climate finance as governments and development banks, usually for moneymaking energy projects, according to a <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">review by the Climate Policy Institute</a>. They could invest much more, experts say, and countries should make it easier for them to do so, by reforming markets and redirecting subsidies away from fossil fuels, for instance.</p><p>Another potential funding source: companies that want to offset their own emissions, either as part of a domestic carbon tax system or to fulfill voluntary commitments. These markets have had their problems, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/climate/how-to-fix-carbon-offsets.html" title="">still funnel billions of dollars a year</a> to developing countries.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Somini Sengupta is the international climate reporter on the Times climate team.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/somini-sengupta">More about Somini Sengupta</a></span></p></div><div><p>Lydia DePillis reports on the American economy.
