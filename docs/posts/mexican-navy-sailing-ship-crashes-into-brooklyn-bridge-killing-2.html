Mayor Eric Adams said <a href="https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/1923956324737351832" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a social media post</a> after midnight that two had died and two were in critical condition. He said the ship had lost power before the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The ship had been docked at Pier 17 in Manhattan, just below the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>On Saturday night, it was supposed to head south and sail out of New York Harbor, with a stop on the Brooklyn waterfront to refuel before heading onward to Iceland.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Instead, at about 8:30 p.m., the Cuauhtémoc was apparently headed in the wrong direction, never intending to sail under the Brooklyn Bridge, said a spokesman for the city’s Office of Emergency Management.</p><p>In videos posted on social media, a tugboat could be seen near the Cuauhtémoc, which appeared to be moving backward, stern first, when it crashed.</p><p>The vessel lurched but stayed upright as it came to a stop at Brooklyn Bridge Park, according to social media video and images from the scene. Its masts appeared to be badly damaged.</p><p>At a news conference on Saturday, the authorities said the pilot who was assigned to navigate the Cuauhtémoc out of the channel experienced “mechanical issues.” The National Transportation Safety Board will be doing a full investigation of the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Nick Corso, 23, was finishing dinner with friends at a restaurant nearby when they saw the ship heading toward them.</p><p>He thought at first that the vessel would clear the bridge, he said, but then “the top lights on the mast disappeared behind the bridge and I was like, oh, it’s not going to make it.”</p><p>When the top of a mast hit the underside of the bridge, he said, “you could hear it snap.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Emergency workers walk with a bloodied man." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17xp-boat-thbg/17xp-boat-thbg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/79e4a0b9-7229-5148-809b-d41769fc21b9" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emergency workers assisted crew members who were on the ship.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At Pier 16, where the injured were brought, a large crowd gathered by the waterfront, and emergency vehicles with lights flashing filled South Street. Periodically, emergency workers wheeled victims with neck braces on toward ambulances and loaded them in on gurneys. Whenever a new survivor appeared, the crowd broke into cheers and applause and chanted: “Mex-i-co! Mex-i-co!”</p><p>One woman with her head bandaged was pushed out on a gurney. She was weeping. Beside her walked two companions in white slacks and striped black-and-white tops. One had her left arm in a sling. The other had her head wrapped in white gauze.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>One man’s nose and uniform were smeared in dark blood and his chin was bandaged.</p><p>Not long after that, a man was wheeled out on a gurney. He held his thumbs in the air when he passed the crowd.</p><p>Octavio Muniz, 44, said he had come from his home in Newark specifically to see the ship because he is from Mexico.</p><p>Mr. Muniz said he had watched in horror as the masts toppled. The crowd around him began to scream and cry.</p><p>“It was horrible,” he said at Pier 16. “It was so sad.”</p><p>Just after midnight, the vessel, with its tall masts askew, docked at Pier 36. Crew members in life jackets, striped shirts and white pants quickly leaped off to secure the ship with ropes, calling out instructions to one another in Spanish.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The New York Police Department and other city agencies responded to the crash on Saturday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Cuauhtémoc<em> </em>is used to train seamen, captains and officers at Mexico’s Heroic Naval Military School, according to a <a href="https://sailleeuwin.com/news-stories/cuauhtemoc-press-release-australia-nz-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news release</a> from one of its cruises. It is a steel-hulled three-masted barque launched in 1982, about 300 feet long.</p><p>The Mexican Navy said in a statement that the Cuauhtémoc had set sail on April 6 from Acapulco on a mission with the goal of “exalting the seafaring spirit, strengthening naval education, and carrying the Mexican people’s message of peace and good will to the seas and ports of the world.”</p><p>It had planned to spend 254 days away making calls in New York; Kingston, Jamaica; Havana; Reykjavik, Iceland; Aberdeen, Scotland; Avilés, Spain; Bridgetown, Barbados; and London.</p><p>The tour stopped abruptly in New York, where the authorities promised an investigation into the episode. Government <a href="https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/files/cp2/CPB2_C09_WEB.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">infrastructure documents</a> show the bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet. The Cuauhtémoc’s masts were roughly 160 feet tall.</p><p>After the crash, all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge were briefly closed in both directions, the city’s <a href="https://x.com/NotifyNYC/status/1923923134618406926" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emergency management notification system</a> reported. Ydanis Rodriguez, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, said that the span was being inspected, but “information is there was not any major damage to the bridge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The Brooklyn Bridge, which took 14 years to build, was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/nyregion/brooklyn-bridge-140-years.html" title="">city’s first suspension bridge</a>. Since its triumphant construction over 140 years ago, the monolithic connector has become a quintessential part of New York City, tying together Brooklyn to Manhattan.
