    <h1>The House Voted to Avert a Government Shutdown</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The House approved legislation tonight to avert a government shutdown roughly six hours before it was set to begin. A majority of lawmakers in both parties voted to extend funding for the federal government into mid-March and approve disaster relief for parts of the nation still reeling from storms.</p><p>The bill moved to the Democrat-controlled Senate for a vote expected this evening. The outlook in the chamber was unclear, though top lawmakers predicted that senators were likely to accept what the House passed and avoid a crisis. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/20/us/government-shutdown-trump-news" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The vote in the House came after some last-minute chaos: An earlier bipartisan spending deal was abandoned after Donald Trump demanded that Congress also increase the debt limit. That led to a revolt in the House, which yesterday rejected a bill to fund the government. As the shutdown loomed, Speaker Mike Johnson agreed today to move forward with a slimmed-down deal that does not address the debt ceiling.</p><p>It was the kind of maneuvering that often happens as Christmas nears, our correspondent Catie Edmondson told me. “There tends to be a little bit of holiday magic when the lawmakers desperately want to go home for the holidays,” she said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The cordoned off Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Heiko Rebsch/DPA, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-12ba0cbb">A driver rammed a German Christmas market, killing 2</h2><p>A driver plowed a vehicle into a Christmas market in the city of Magdeburg in central Germany this evening, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/europe/germany-christmas-market-crash.html" title="">killing at least two people and injuring more than 65 others</a>, 14 of them severely.

In 2016, an extremist rammed a truck into a crowd in Berlin, killing 13.

Now I’m 21 and my sister is 17, and I’m still looking forward to beating her at the Pickle Hunt. — <em>Lauren Radicchi, Pawling, N.Y.</em></p></blockquote><p>This one was particularly fun because my family also hides a pickle ornament on our Christmas tree.

It turns out there’s no way a typical home could have powered so many lights in the 1980s. And even if the Griswolds found a way, it would have cost about $287 a day or $8,885 per month. If they used modern LEDs, it would still cost the family about $34 a day or $1,054 a month.</p><p>Have a dazzling weekend.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
