New tariffs were set to go into effect on imports from Canada, China and Mexico on Tuesday, but on Monday Mexico and Canada were granted a one-month delay.</p><p>“The European Union has abused the United States for years, and they can’t do that,” Mr. Trump said on Monday.</p><p>A head-spinning blitz of executive orders and policy reversals related to international trade, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/03/us/trump-usaid-news" title="">aid</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-world-health-organization.html" title="">agreements</a> has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" title="">come</a> out of the White House in the past two weeks. But one common thread is that Mr. Trump has directed the harshest penalties at some of America’s closest economic and military allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>One reason is that the United States has large trade deficits with Mexico, Canada and the European Union in addition to China, said Agathe Demarais, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p>“Trump is obsessed with trade deficits,” she said. And he may be “starting with the places where he feels he will have quick wins.”</p><p>Of course, trade surpluses are not necessarily any indication of a country’s economic health. The last time the United States had an overall trade surplus was 1975, when the American economy was still in a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-depressed-the-consumer-the-household-balance-sheet-and-the-1973-75-recession/#:~:text=THE%20RECESSION%20of%201973%2D75,most%20severe%20previous%20postwar%20recession." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">severe recession.</a></p><p>The United States did have a trade <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/articles/uktradewiththeunitedstates2023/2023#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20Bureau%20of,is%20inaccurate%20in%20their%20estimation." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surplus</a> in 2023 with Britain, according to the U.S. <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/us-international-trade-goods-and-services-november-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>. And that may help Britain avoid tariffs. “I think that one can be worked out,” Mr. Trump said, contrasting Britain with Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As for the European Union, Mr. Trump has characterized the bloc’s trade practices as an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTiuB1vUnI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“atrocity.”</a> But tariffs imposed by the United States and the European Union on each other are pretty similar.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Yangshan Port in Shanghai.

A 3.5 percent tariff on average is added to products from the European Union that head west across the Atlantic.</p><p>The disparities, however, are bigger on some items, like cars. The European Union tariff is 10 percent, compared with 2.5 percent from the United States. And E.U. tariffs on food and beverages are on average 3.5 percent higher than those set by the United States. Mr. Trump has long complained about both sectors.</p><p>The United States is the No. 1 buyer of E.U. exports, accounting for nearly 20 percent of the total in 2023, according to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=USA-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,of%20goods%20(13.7%20%25)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eurostat</a>.

Business leaders and trade associations are warning that the brewing trade war and the unpredictable way in which it is being waged could slow investment. American tariffs on European goods would also hurt companies when they were weakened by flagging demand at home and in China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark, left, with Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk.

In addition to the car companies, a web of auto parts suppliers, such as Bosch and ZF, have research and production plants there.</p><p>Asian and European stock markets fell on Monday, with some of the biggest drops in share prices among auto manufacturers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Economists at the Prognos Institute in Switzerland calculated that 1.2 million jobs in Germany were dependent on exports to the United States, and that as many as 300,000 of them could be endangered if tariffs against Europe came into effect.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump with Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, at the opening of a leather workshop in Texas in 2019.

In 2019, the United States briefly imposed 25 percent tariffs on French wines and Italian cheeses, as well as luxury leather handbags and luggage from brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci.</p><p>Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton empire, has sought to cultivate direct ties with Mr. Trump, who personally invited him to attend last month’s inauguration in Washington. At an earnings presentation last week, Mr. Arnault said that by lowering the corporate tax to 15 percent and “welcoming you with open arms,” Mr. Trump was making the United States more attractive for companies.</p><p>There can be reasons for a country to worry about too large a trade deficit, said Ms. Clausing, the Peterson Institute economist. But the United States is not facing those problems at the moment.</p><p>The trade deficit signals that American consumers are getting a lot of stuff from the rest of the world, she explained. If tariffs drive up prices and Americans have to pay more, as most economists expect, their standard of living will go down.</p><p>Liz Alderman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris, <!-- -->Melissa Eddy<!-- --> from Berlin and <!-- -->Jeanna Smialek<!-- --> from Brussels.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
