Taylor, a legal adviser for the State Department, also argued that the existing United Nations system to address climate change is sufficient, despite criticism that it has failed to stop the dangerous rise in global temperatures.</p><p>“The U.N. climate change regime, with the Paris Agreement at its core, is the only international legal regime specifically designed by states to address climate change,” Ms. Taylor said. “Cooperative efforts through that regime provide the best hope for protecting the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations.”</p><p>Left unaddressed in her remarks was how long the United States might remain a party to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/climate/biden-paris-climate-agreement.html" title="">Paris Agreement</a>, the 2015 deal in which nearly every country in the world committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Donald J. Trump pulled out of the accord during his first term as president, and is expected to do so again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Taylor’s remarks set off a flurry of condemnation from small island nations and environmental groups, who argue that more action is urgently needed. At a series of hearings this month, the first at the court addressing climate change, they are seeking to hold the United States and other large historical polluters accountable for damage to the planet.</p><p>Ralph Regenvanu, special envoy for climate change and environment for the island nation of Vanuatu, said he was disappointed with the position the United States, Australia, Saudi Arabia and China had taken in their statements.</p><p>“These nations, some of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters, have pointed to existing treaties and commitments that have regrettably failed to motivate substantial reductions in emissions,” he said. “Let me be clear: These treaties are essential, but they cannot be a veil for inaction or a substitute for legal accountability.”</p><p>Dr. Delta Merner of the Union of Concerned Scientists said that the United States had “resisted calls for climate accountability” in its statement despite its role as the world’s largest historical polluter of greenhouse gases.</p><p>“Instead of taking responsibility for its contributions to the climate crisis, the United States used its 30-minute slot to downplay the role of the courts for global climate action, emphasize nonbinding national commitments under the Paris Agreement, and reject the notion of historical responsibility,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The hearings are being held at the highest judicial body of the United Nations, sometimes called the world’s top court, in response to a request from the U.N. General Assembly for an advisory opinion about the obligations of states under international law on climate change. The court’s opinion could be taken into consideration in other cases before international and national courts, potentially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/climate/climate-lawsuits-major-cases.html" title="">spurring more lawsuits</a> against countries for failing to curb emissions.</p><p>The request to the court came after a campaign initially led by students in Vanuatu, which has taken <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/climate/vanuatu-president-nonproliferation-hague.html" title="">a leading role</a> in climate diplomacy. Representatives from more than 100 countries are set to speak before the hearings conclude on Dec. 13.</p><p>Laurence Tubiana, the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, who served as France’s top climate envoy when the Paris accord was reached, also raised alarms after the testimony by the United States.</p><p>“We cannot allow anyone to misuse the Paris Agreement to dilute their climate responsibilities and accountability,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karen Zraick covers legal affairs for the Climate desk and the courtroom clashes playing out over climate and environmental policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karen-zraick">More about Karen Zraick</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
