If the measure passes, it would lead to a formal, detailed report that could ultimately send the issue to the U.N. Security Council for possible retaliatory measures against Iran.</p><p>It’s unclear if European nations in particular are willing to delay a censure of Iran for blocking some inspectors from key nuclear sites and for dismantling cameras and other monitoring gear there. A companion to the new report indicated that U.N. inspectors still cannot gain access to a number of key nuclear sites, including ones that have been off limits for years, and the agency said it could no longer guarantee that nuclear fuel hasn’t been diverted to clandestine facilities.</p><p>During the visit to Tehran by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, the Iranians told of preparations to halt the enrichment process that has most worried American, European and Israeli officials, presumably in a show of seriousness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rafael Mariano Grossi, center left, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Mohammad Eslami, center right, head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, at a news conference in Tehran last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I hope it doesn’t happen,” Dr. Albright said of the possibility that the agency could drop its censure move. “An enrichment cap would be meaningless because Iran could restart production at a moment’s notice,” he said, “and it already has enough material in its stockpile to make enough fuel for four or five nuclear weapons.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The report said that during the last reporting period, Iran added 35 pounds to its stockpile of uranium enriched to a purity of 60 percent. That’s about 10 percent of what it has produced since it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks-uranium-explainer.html" title="">began its push</a> in early 2021 to make the near-bomb-grade material.</p><p>The report offered no indication that Iran was receiving technical help in its nuclear program from Russia, presumably in return for its help in Moscow’s war in Ukraine. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, made that assertion more than a month ago <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/09/10/blinken-russia-iran-ukraine-missiles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a speech</a>, but offered no details about what kind of help Iran was receiving.</p><p>Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> and <!-- -->David E.
