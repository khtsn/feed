On Monday, New York’s Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, issued a letter demanding the cuts be restored.</p><p>The initial reaction from Republicans was more muted, but by Wednesday, as it became clearer that the blowback to the firings was widespread, the Republican resistance grew more vocal, especially from districts in and around New York City, where the memory of 9/11 still resonates powerfully.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This staff reduction will only make it more difficult for the program to supervise its contracts and to care for its members who are comprised of the brave men and women who ran towards danger and helped in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks,” the members of Congress wrote in the letter.</p><p>It was largely written by Representative Andrew R. Garbarino, a Republican from Long Island, and co-signed by five other members from New York and Representative Chris Smith from New Jersey. The New York co-signers were Nick LaLota, Mike Lawler, Claudia Tenney, Nicole Malliotakis and Nick Langworthy, all supporters of Mr. Trump.</p><p>The World Trade Center Health Program’s 90-member staff was reduced by about 20 percent, as 16 probationary staff members who oversee and administer the program were fired and others took buyouts, according to congressional representatives, terminated employees and advocates for the program.</p><p>The program is overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under the Department of Health and Human Services, which was recently taken over by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Mr. Trump named as secretary.</p><p>The cuts were part of widespread agency layoffs, in which several thousand probationary Health and Human Services workers were terminated last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The representatives also urged Mr. Trump to restore funding for research being done by the New York Fire Department that compares incidence rates of illness in their ranks with those of other urban departments — a grant that was deemed “nonessential.”</p><p>“This could not be further from the truth,” said the letter.</p><p>Dr. David J. Prezant, chief medical officer for the Fire Department, said on Wednesday that “this study is critical because without it, we cannot definitively prove that illnesses are World Trade Center-related.”</p><p>The program provides vital medical care for its members and conducts research on the health impact of the attacks and related conditions.</p><p>Advocates say the cuts would delay new enrollment and make fewer staffers available to address patients’ problems and assist with diagnoses and treatment.</p><p>“These cuts are really critical,” said Anthony Gardner, 48, who said he received a termination notice on Saturday. “They could really be the difference between life and death for some members.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The team was already bare bones and understaffed to begin with, so I’m really hoping Secretary Kennedy looks at these cuts and hopefully reconsiders and prevents any further reductions,” said Mr. Gardner, who handled communications for the program.</p><p>In their letter to Mr. Kennedy on Monday, Mr. Schumer and Ms. Gillibrand noted that when they met with him before his confirmation hearing, Mr. Kennedy had committed to ensuring that 9/11 emergency workers and survivors would continue to get necessary care.</p><p>In the letter, they urged him to reverse “the rash and counterproductive termination” of staff members to ensure services for “those who answered the call on 9/11 and are now sick with respiratory ailments, cancer and other conditions.”<br/></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The 9/11 program is overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Drew Angerer/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The program, which now helps 137,000 members, was created by Congress in 2011 as part of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to provide treatment for emergency workers, cleanup crews and those living in Lower Manhattan who were sickened by airborne toxins at ground zero.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It also includes those who were exposed at the crash sites in Shanksville, Pa., and at the Pentagon.</p><p>The cuts would be likely to worsen an existing backlog to new entrants to the program, said John Feal, a retired construction worker from Long Island who was injured while helping with cleanup and recovery efforts at the World Trade Center.</p><p>“The cuts are reckless and inhumane — they inflict more damage on survivors who have suffered for the last 24 years,” said Mr. Feal, who partnered with the host of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart, to lobby members of Congress to support the compensation fund.</p><p>“Without it doing its job, people will die, it’s that simple,” Mr. Feal said of the fund. “If you have stage-3 lung cancer, you’re going to wait longer to get your illness certified.”</p><p>Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to messages on Wednesday, nor did White House officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Benjamin Chevat, executive director at Citizens for Extension of the James Zadroga Act, called for the jobs to be restored and other halted operations restarted “so that 9/11 responders and survivors can get the care that they need and deserve without delay.”</p><p>The cuts, he said, would reduce staff members’ ability to respond to patient complaints and intervene on prescription and treatment issues.</p><p>Commissioner Robert Tucker of the Fire Department called the program “a lifeline to sickened 9/11 responders who selflessly gave so much.”</p><p>He added, “This will hinder our efforts to provide treatment coverage for new conditions, which is a tragedy for all Americans who swore they would never forget.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Corey Kilgannon is a Times reporter who writes about crime and criminal justice in and around New York City, as well as breaking news and other feature stories.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
