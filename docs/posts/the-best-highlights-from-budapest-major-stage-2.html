<p>The series began on Pearl, with the two teams running near mirror compositions, with the only difference being the choice of the second Initiator. Playing Sova, <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/21486/sarahcat">
		sarahcat	</a>
</span> nearly aced MIBR on the first pistol of the lower final. After preventing the bonus round win, MIBR built momentum off of strong post-plants on B site. It looked as if MIBR would take the lead at the half, but Shopify adapted and tied the game 6-6.</p>

<p>MIBR won the second pistol round off some late-round chaos, but converted the bonus to extend the lead. Reaching round 17 down 10-6, a timeout from Shopify led to the first attack-round win. That was when the shotcalling from <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3063/mel">
		meL	</a>
</span> started to deliver Shopify a needed comeback, tying the map late at 11-11. An 11-8 lead disappeared for MIBR, as <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9185/dodonut">
		dodonut	</a>
</span> stepped up and Shopify won Pearl 13-11. </p>


<p><em>dodonut ends Pearl to complete the comeback on map one.</em></p>

<p>Split was next up, and MIBR won the first pistol off of its double-Duelist composition, but were unable to get around the double-Initiator from Shopify on the bound round. MIBR kept the lead starting on defense, winning clutches and landing big ultimates to reach the half up 9-3.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/31574/srn">
		srN	</a>
</span> gets two with the Raze ult to end the first half on Split.</em></p>

<p>A triple Sherriff buy from MIBR paid off as the team won another pistol to push Shopify into a tougher position. Shopify started to show some fight, but it was too late as MIBR won Split 13-6 to tie the series at 1-1.</p>

<p>Moving to Corrode, MIBR stuck to double-Duelist with the slight change of moving off Raze and to Waylay, while Shopify ran double-Controller and double-Initiator. MIBR secured the first pistol, and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4807/bstrdd">
		bstrdd	</a>
</span> stole an Odin for the bonus round conversion. MIBR were rolling through Shopify, but after a timeout led to Shopify winning its first round of the map, the adjustments were immaculate. Shopify went from a 6-0 deficit to a 6-6 tie at the half.</p>

<p>Shopify won the second pistol on Corrode to continue the round win streak and took its first lead of the map. Unable to convert the bonus, Shopify remained ahead thanks to some great calls and shots from IGL meL. Afterward, just like map one, dodonut stepped up to close out the map as Shopify won Corrode 13-7.</p>


<p><em>bstrdd gets four, but can&#39;t get the map win on Corrode.</em></p>

<p>Abyss was the first potential final map for the series, with MIBR finally swapping off the double-Duelist to a double-Initiator, while Shopify ran double-Controller. MIBR earned the first pistol, but after losing the bonus round, dodonut awoke with the Operator on Yoru. After playing only Waylay up to this point in the series, the Yoru from dodonut looked clean as they ended the first half with 16 kills as Shopify was up 8-4.</p>

<p>However, the second half started perfectly for MIBR, winning pistol and converting the bonus to erase the four-round deficit and forcing multiple ties late into the map. Someone was going to step up to win the map for one of the squads, and it was sarah from Shopify.</p>


<p><em>sarah frags through four opponents to win a late round on Abyss.</em></p>

<p>Even as Shopify went on an eco soon after, sarah landed three Sheriff shots to put Shopify on series point. Then, for the third time in the series, dodonut won the final round to finalize the 13-11 scoreline and lock in the series victory for Shopify Rebellion Gold.</p>

<p>The star of the series was dodonut, who played an amazing series as the sole Duelist on Shopify. She ended the series with a 1.32 match rating, 85 kills, 160 ADR, and 18 first kills.</p>

<p>With this win, Shopify Rebellion Gold makes it to another Game Changers Championship final and has an opportunity to win its third straight title in the circuit by defeating <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581494/team-liquid-brazil-vs-shopify-rebellion-gold-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-gf" target="_blank">Team Liquid Brazil in an upper bracket final rematch</a>. As for MIBR GC, the team is officially eliminated from the tournament after a great run through the lower bracket, finishing in third place.</p>
