</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Among these urban counties, how much they shifted toward Mr. Trump is correlated with how diverse their population is. At one end, Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is, has the lowest nonwhite population share and made no shift at all. At the other, the Bronx and Miami have the highest nonwhite share and made large shifts toward Mr. Trump.</p><p>It’s possible that dissatisfaction with city conditions is part of what has pushed some Black, Asian and Hispanic voters away from Democrats, or to stay home on Election Day (a number of those voters who sat out this election <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/upshot/election-turnout-harris-trump.html" title="">may not have voted Democratic</a> even if they had gone to the polls). But similar shifts happened outside of cities, especially in places with more Hispanic residents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“That shifting was happening everywhere — so it’s happening in Lawrence, Mass., as much as it’s happening in the Rio Grande Valley, it’s happening in the Central Valley of California, it’s happening in Grand Rapids and Detroit,” said Carlos Odio, a co-founder of Equis Research, a Democratic-leaning group that focuses on Latino voters. “These places are so different that the only thing they have in common is that the kinds of people who are switching, they identify as Hispanic.”</p><p>He and other researchers and pollsters will now spend months trying to understand why ties have broadly loosened between Hispanic voters and the Democratic Party. But the answer is probably not a story that fits in New York but fails along the Rio Grande.</p><p>In cities where more granular precinct data is available, the same demographic pattern <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/28/us/elections/precinct-city-maps.html" title="">recurs at the neighborhood scale</a>: Overall, Mr. Trump is most popular in precincts where white residents are the largest group by population, but he made the smallest<em> gains</em> in such places this year. The broadest gains he made were often in Hispanic neighborhoods, whether they’re predominantly Mexican, Puerto Rican or Dominican.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-13"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="up-cities-results-analysis" data-id="100000009849897" data-source-id="100000009849897"><div slug="up-cities-results-analysis" data-sourceid="100000009849897" id="embed-id-100000009849897">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Among core urban counties, some voting differences clearly can’t be explained by basic diversity numbers. Why did Brooklyn, an East Coast liberal enclave, shift 11 points more than Washington, D.C., another East Coast liberal enclave with a similar share of nonwhite residents? Why did the Detroit area shift so much more than Milwaukee, when both are similarly diverse and subject to swing-state dynamics?</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>There are also nuances within racial and ethnic groups, white voters included. Detroit’s white population differs from Milwaukee’s — Wayne County, Mich., has one of the country’s largest communities of Arab Americans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/dearborn-michigan-trump-arab-voters.html" title="">who broke away from Democrats</a> over the war in Gaza (census data currently counts people of Middle Eastern and North African descent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/25/us/census-race-ethnicity-middle-east-north-africa.html" title="">as white</a>). Washington’s white voters also differ from Brooklyn’s — the nation’s capital, which shifted less than one point toward Mr. Trump, has the lowest share of white working-class adults of all of these urban counties.</p><h2 id="link-342d60b9">Other potential factors</h2><p>There is no denying that over the past four years, many big cities have faced acute problems distinct from the surge in inflation that angered voters nationwide.</p><p>To test whether those ills were related to the rightward shifts, we compiled data on the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/03/estimating-county-level-regional-price-parities-public-data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local cost of living</a>, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/methodology-zori-repeat-rent-27092/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">growth in rents</a> and <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/data/hpi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">home prices</a>, <a href="https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::residential-construction-permits-by-county/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new housing permits</a> and <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hdx/pit-hic/#2024-pit-count-and-hic-guidance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">homelessness</a>. We looked at where migrants have settled, using <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">court records from federal deportation cases</a>. We considered <a href="https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long pandemic school closures</a>. To identify where residents may have been disaffected enough to pack up and leave, we measured which urban counties had lost population share since 2019. We also considered the places <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-in-the-United-St/kn79-hsxy/about_data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit hardest by Covid deaths</a>.</p><p>Then we modeled whether these factors were able to predict how an urban county voted in the election.</p><p>Some data was incomplete, and many of these variables overlap, making it difficult to disentangle their effects statistically. When we sized them up individually, only some of these factors correlated with election results. After we controlled for race, those effects faded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Three measures, looked at together, did help to fill in some of the differences between urban counties that remained after considering race: the share of white adults without a college degree, the local cost of living and migrant arrivals. But race still remained far and away the most important factor.</p><p>In an election year when voters were broadly upset about inflation, perhaps it mattered more in big cities, often already expensive places to live. But it doesn’t appear that voters shifted more in places where housing costs had risen the most. Big cities are also places where homelessness and high rents are longtime issues, said Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. That might make it less likely they can explain recent political changes.</p><p>Several of the counties that shifted significantly to the right also received among the most migrants since 2021, including Miami-Dade in Florida, much of New York City, and Essex and Union Counties in New Jersey. (This is also another difference between Brooklyn and Washington.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/multimedia/urban-trump-shift-pmjk/urban-trump-shift-pmjk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/multimedia/urban-trump-shift-pmjk/urban-trump-shift-pmjk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/multimedia/urban-trump-shift-pmjk/urban-trump-shift-pmjk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Woman holding sign" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/multimedia/urban-trump-shift-pmjk/urban-trump-shift-pmjk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/multimedia/urban-trump-shift-pmjk/urban-trump-shift-pmjk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/multimedia/urban-trump-shift-pmjk/urban-trump-shift-pmjk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/05/multimedia/urban-trump-shift-pmjk/urban-trump-shift-pmjk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c20fd2e1-ebfd-58a7-a5f5-76f744e65385" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A campaign rally for Donald Trump at Crotona Park in the South Bronx, held in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Counties with long school closures did shift more toward Mr. Trump nationwide than counties where school returned to normal faster. But after accounting for race, the effect largely disappears. Because long closures happened broadly across big cities (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/us/politics/school-reopening-black-families.html" title="">often reflecting the concerns</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/us/covid-school-reopening-virtual-learning.html" title="">of nonwhite families</a>), they also can’t explain the voting differences among urban counties. For example, highly diverse New York City, San Francisco, Baltimore, Atlanta and New Orleans had widely varying election shifts. But all of them had long school closures.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>One other factor we didn’t measure is crime, given that crime data is particularly spotty and difficult to compare across places. In politics, perceptions of crime may also matter more than actual crime, and the two trends often <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">point in different directions</a>. So we don’t dismiss that crime fears may influence voters in a presidential election; we just can’t measure them.</p><p>Our overall analysis doesn’t mean that urban residents are unbothered by local problems. But that anger may not have much to do with choosing the country’s president.</p><p>If anything, said the Vanderbilt political scientist John Sides, U.S. politics have become increasingly nationalized — dominated by issues and dynamics at the national level. The theory of Democratic cities in disarray implies the opposite: that in big cities, a national election was actually localized.</p><p>Imagine a scenario, Mr. Sides suggested, where cities still experienced the same problems — subway crime in New York, a housing crisis in Los Angeles — but there had been no nationwide surge in inflation. Who wins that presidential race in a different national environment? Quite likely the Democrat, he said, and then perhaps people wouldn’t be having this same conversation.</p><p>Some urban voters did clearly express frustration with local conditions this year — in local elections.
