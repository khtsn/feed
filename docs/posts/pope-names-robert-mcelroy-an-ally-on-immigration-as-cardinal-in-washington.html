Trump is inaugurated and signals that Pope Francis is establishing his own priorities in the face of the incoming administration.<span>  </span>Many powerful American Catholics, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, have aligned themselves with Mr. Trump’s efforts against immigration and abortion.</p><p>Cardinal McElroy, 70, is a longtime supporter of the pope’s pastoral agenda, and is known for regularly speaking out on the inclusion of migrants, women and L.G.B.T.Q. people in the Catholic church and in the United States.</p><p>He will succeed Cardinal Wilton Gregory, 77, the first African-American to be made a cardinal,<span>  </span>a member of the church’s highest governing body.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At a news conference at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington on Monday morning, Cardinal McElroy directly addressed Mr. Trump’s immigration proposals, stating that plans for a “wider, indiscriminate, massive deportation across the country” would be “incompatible with Catholic doctrine.”</p><p>While the Catholic church teaches that a country has the right to control its borders, it also centers the “dignity of every human person,” he said.</p><p>Cardinal McElroy also spoke briefly in Spanish, directly addressing the archdiocese’s Hispanic community, reminding them that the church was the mother of all — “todos, todos, todos,” he repeated — especially in difficult times.</p><p>His presence in Washington will stand in contrast to prominent Catholics in Mr. Trump’s administration. Mr. Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, advanced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/us/politics/trump-vance-nativist.html" title="">hard-line anti-immigrant agenda</a> on the campaign trail last year. Alongside Mr. Trump, Mr. Vance called for mass deportations, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/vance-trump-legal-immigrants.html" title="">promised to end legal immigration programs</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/haitians-springfield-ohio-pets.html" title="">spread baseless rumors</a> that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing and eating pets. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/jd-vance-catholic-church-conversion.html" title="">represents the traditionalist wing of the church</a>, which has gained strength in Republican circles as it pushes against the rise of secularism.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s nominee for ambassador to the Holy See, Brian Burch, is the longtime president of Catholic Vote, a group that helped to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/jd-vance-pennsylvania-catholic.html" title="">mobilize conservative Catholics to support Mr. Trump for his opposition to immigration</a>, abortion, and transgender rights. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As bishop of the San Diego diocese, along the border with Mexico, Cardinal McElroy has a history of standing with immigrants, who represent a significant constituency for the Catholic church both globally and in the U.S.</p><p>As an undergraduate at Harvard University, he studied with Oscar Handlin, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/us/oscar-handlin-historian-who-chronicled-united-states-immigration-dies-at-95.html" title="">prominent scholar</a> who shifted public views about the role of immigration in American history. </p><p>Shortly after Mr. Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Cardinal McElroy, then a new bishop in San Diego appointed by Pope Francis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/us/houses-of-worship-poised-to-serve-as-trump-era-immigrant-sanctuaries.html" title="">told a Catholic immigration conference</a> that it was “unthinkable” to stand by as Mr. Trump promised to deport millions of immigrants.</p><p>He <a href="https://cmsny.org/publications/bishop-robert-mcelroy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> Mr. Trump’s policy as “an act of injustice which would stain our national honor,” and equated it with the United States’ internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and its dispossession of Native Americans.</p><p>He also <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2017/09/05/san-diego-political-religious-leaders-slam-trumps-decision-to-end-daca/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke out</a> when President Trump tried to end the program that protects from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/biden-daca-immigration.html" title="">deportation</a> about 700,000 immigrants, known as Dreamers, who entered the country as children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As other Catholic bishops sought to make abortion their pre-eminent issue, Cardinal McElroy often argued that abortion was only one of several critical priorities of Catholic moral teaching. When conservative bishops targeted President Biden, America’s second Catholic president, with a proposal in 2021 to deny politicians communion because of their support of abortion rights, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/18/us/targeting-biden-catholic-bishops-advance-controversial-communion-plan.html" title="">pushed back</a>, saying that under such a proposal, the sacrament, “which seeks to make us one, will become for millions of Catholics a sign of division.”</p><p>Cardinal McElroy has made a case for the “<a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2023/01/24/mcelroy-synodality-inclusion-244587" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">radical inclusion</a>” of women and L.G.B.T.Q. people in church life and leadership. In 2022, Pope Francis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/29/world/europe/pope-francis-21-new-cardinals.html" title="">made him a cardinal</a>, and therefore eligible to vote on the pontiff’s successor.</p><p>Past leaders of the archdiocese of Washington have navigated the inherently political nature of the posting in their own ways. A scholar of American history by training, Cardinal McElroy is a rare prelate who holds a doctorate from Stanford University in political science, and he has not shied away from contemporary controversies, either in the church or in the nation.</p><p>“Our political society has been poisoned by a tribalism that is sapping our energy as a people and endangering our democracy,” he wrote in <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2023/01/24/mcelroy-synodality-inclusion-244587" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">America Magazine</a>, a Jesuit publication, in 2023. “And that poison has entered destructively into the life of the church.”</p><p>In December, as Mr. Trump promised to crack down on immigration once again, Cardinal McElroy and 11 other bishops from California <a href="https://cacatholic.org/statements/am-i-not-here-i-who-am-your-mother/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> in support of “our migrant brothers and sisters.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We want to assure you that we, and our mother, the Church, stand with you in these days of anxiety,” they wrote, promising “to advocate for your dignity and family unity.”</p><p>The date of Cardinal McElroy’s installation has not yet been set, though the diocese of San Diego stated that it would take place in March. A new bishop of San Diego remains to be appointed.</p><p>Though the archdiocese of Washington is home to about half as many Catholics as the diocese of San Diego, it is one of the most prominent postings in the country. The archdiocese includes the nation’s capital, as well as major institutions like the Catholic University of America and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Catholic church in North America.</p><p>Cardinal Gregory moved to Washington in 2019 from Atlanta, where he was archbishop, following a tumultuous period when church leaders in Washington were at the center of America’s sexual abuse crisis. Pope Francis elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 2020, at a time of widespread calls for racial justice across the country and within the church. Cardinal Gregory plans to retire, but to remain in Washington.</p><p>Elisabetta Povoledo<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elizabeth Dias is The Times’s national religion correspondent, covering faith, politics and values.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/elizabeth-dias">More about Elizabeth Dias</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>14</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Pope Names Supporter of Migrants to Lead Archdiocese of Washington<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
