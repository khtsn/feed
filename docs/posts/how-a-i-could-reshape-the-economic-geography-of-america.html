    <h1>How A.I. Could Reshape the Economic Geography of America</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Chattanooga, Tenn., a midsize Southern city, is on no one’s list of artificial intelligence hot spots.</p><p>But as the technology’s use moves beyond a few big city hubs and is more widely adopted across the economy, Chattanooga and other once-struggling cities in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and South are poised to be among the unlikely winners, a recent study found.</p><p>The shared attributes of these metropolitan areas include an educated work force, affordable housing and workers who are mostly in occupations and industries less likely to be replaced or disrupted by A.I., according <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4874104" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to the study</a> by two labor economists, Scott Abrahams, an assistant professor at Louisiana State University, and Frank Levy, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These cities are well positioned to use A.I. to become more productive, helping to draw more people to those areas.</p><p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4874104" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The study</a> is part of a growing body of research pointing to the potential for chatbot-style artificial intelligence to fuel a reshaping of the population and labor market map of America. A.I.’s transformative force could change the nation’s economy and politics, much like other technological revolutions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This is a powerful technology that will sweep through American offices with potentially very significant geographic implications,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, where he studies the regional effects of technology and government policy. “We need to think about what’s coming down the pike.”</p><p>At issue is a new and rapidly growing breed of the technology known as generative A.I., which can quickly draft business reports, write software and answer questions, often with human-level skill. Already, predictions abound that generative A.I. will displace workers in call centers, software developers and business analysts.</p><p>That pattern of technology disruption has happened before. The industrial revolution mechanized agriculture, pushing workers off farms and into cities. Modern cars and roads brought the rise of the suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. Factory automation and globalization, accelerated by the internet, destroyed jobs in traditional manufacturing centers, depopulating parts of the Midwest and South.</p><p>While uncertainty remains about how fast and how far into workplaces generative A.I. will reach, a series of studies have concluded that <a href="https://www.gspublishing.com/content/research/en/reports/2023/03/27/d64e052b-0f6e-45d7-967b-d7be35fabd16.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the impact is likely to be substantial</a>, perhaps automating the equivalent of millions of jobs.</p><p>To date, the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/building-ai-cities-how-to-spread-the-benefits-of-an-emerging-technology-across-more-of-america/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regions benefiting the most</a> from the rapidly progressing technology have been a handful of metro areas where scientists are building A.I., including Silicon Valley.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But those places are also some of the ones most apt to face issues as A.I. gets better and can automate jobs, according to the labor economists’ study. Centers of technology and office work including San Jose, San Francisco, Washington, New York and Boston are home to large numbers of high-paid workers, from business analysts to computer programmers, whose tasks involve generating words or code, which is what A.I. does well.</p><p>But exposure to A.I. does not necessarily translate to sweeping job losses. These cities, the economists note, have proved to be among the most resilient, dynamic places in the country, able to withstand setbacks and recover.</p><p>In their paper, the two labor economists identified nearly two dozen metropolitan areas expected to benefit from the broader adoption of A.I. technology, including Dayton, Ohio; Scranton, Pa.; Savannah, Ga.; and Greenville, S.C.</p><p>Chattanooga is already attracting technology-enabled businesses and workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Evan Shelley, wearing a blue jacket, a black T-shirt and beige pants, stands with one hand leaning on the trunk of a yellow car." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv/AI-MIGRATE-1-03-gtcv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/49a4e607-fa8e-54f1-bb58-a8a38ca2e531" decoding="async" width="600" height="480"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evan Shelley describes his start-up, Truck Parking Club, as “Airbnb for truck parking.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Evan Shelley moved to Chattanooga from Miami last year, bringing his start-up with him.

Their expertise, Mr. Shelley said, is a crucial asset and a selling point. But the start-up is developing generative A.I. for its mobile app to answer basic questions and to assist its customer service workers.</p><p>Chattanooga’s city-owned utility, <a href="https://epb.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EPB</a>, has been a tech pioneer, offering some of the world’s fastest internet service for more than a decade, and it remains an innovative leader. Last year, EPB began offering a <a href="https://www.chattanoogaquantum.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commercially available quantum network</a> to let businesses and scientists experiment with the emerging technology of quantum computing.</p><p>The city government is experimenting with chatbot technology, training the A.I. on the text of its local laws, regulations and ordinances. The software will answer questions or operate as a conversational assistant to walk citizens through tasks like getting a business license.</p><p>“We’re trying to prepare our people for working with A.I., focus on the benefits and make the most of it,” said Tim Kelly, the mayor of Chattanooga.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Chattanooga has nurtured other start-ups in logistics, shipping and trucking, taking advantage of its location in “Freight Alley,” connected by interstate highways to Atlanta; Nashville; Knoxville, Tenn.; and Birmingham, Ala.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Truck Parking Club links tens of thousands of long-haul truckers to more than 1,100 parking locations around the country.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><a href="https://shappi.com/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shappi</a>, a start-up shipping consumer goods to South America, moved to Chattanooga from San Diego two years ago, in part thanks to investors in the area.
