<p>MIBR opened the series with their pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581500/g2-gozen-vs-mibr-gc-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr3/?game=240158&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, where they steamrolled <span data-ref-id="2">

</span> 13-4 in their previous match. Up against MIBR&#39;s double-Duelist composition, G2 adopted an unorthodox approach to their defense, frequently stacking four on one site in the preround. Undeterred, MIBR barreled through anyways, winning out firefights on both sides to take an early 6-2 lead. G2 scraped a couple more rounds through aggressive pushes from the stack, but MIBR ended the half still ahead 8-4. </p>

<p>Down 10-4 after dropping the second pistol, G2 began to pull things back largely thanks to the heroics of <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/20064/vania">
		Vania	</a>
</span>, who clutched a 1v3 in round 17 followed by a 4K in round 18. </p>


<p><em>Vania brings G2 back into the game with a pivotal 1v3.</em></p>

<p>With the economy stacked in their favor, G2 ran the score all the way back to 10-10 and then to 12-10, seemingly primed to complete the comeback, but MIBR won two key rounds with multikills of their own to force overtime.</p>

<p>Back on their favored side of attack, MIBR won a flawless round and proceeded to win Bind 14-12, denying the G2 comeback attempt. Vania still ended at the top of the standings with a 24/17/9 KDA, 1.40 rating, and 170 ADR on Brimstone. For MIBR, <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/31574/srn">
		srN	</a>
</span> came the closest in terms of fragging, with the Raze putting up 22 kills, 167 ADR, and seven first bloods.</p>

<p>The next map was G2&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581500/g2-gozen-vs-mibr-gc-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr3/?game=240159&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a>. As it was the first time playing the map in this event for both teams, both made slight changes to their previous compositions, with G2 shifting from double-Duelist to double-Sentinel and MIBR going from double-Initiator to double-Controller. </p>

<p>G2 delivered on their favored side of defense, dominating the first half to a 10-2 scoreline. <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/24149/amy">
		amy	</a>
</span>&#39;s Chamber and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/17323/mimi">
		mimi	</a>
</span>&#39;s Sage positioned on the extremities proved too much for MIBR to handle as G2 consistently found first picks and countered MIBR&#39;s slow defaults with proactive reclears. </p>

<p>Any hope of an MIBR comeback was shut down after G2 immediately won an eco after losing the pistol, taking the score to 12-3. The map finally ended after an ace from Vania, who outdid her own Bind performance with an outstanding 26/11/7 KDA, 391 ACS, and a 2.04 rating. </p>


<p><em>Vania puts an end to Sunset on her own.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581500/g2-gozen-vs-mibr-gc-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr3/?game=240160&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a> delivered another thriller, although it didn&#39;t seem to be that way at first as G2 snowballed a pistol and a bonus into another commanding 10-2 defensive half. Everything in the first half went the way of G2, from crucial duels to late-round clutches as they brought themselves three rounds away from winning the series.</p>

<p>MIBR needed heroes, and heroes emerged. <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/4807/bstrdd">
		bstrdd	</a>
</span> in particular stole the show with a bold push through the enemy Cosmic Divide for a 3K in round 17 followed by an anti-eco ace in round 18 to pull the score back to 11-7 and set the comeback in motion. </p>


<p><em>bstrdd takes a risk and it pays off when her team needs it the most.</em></p>

<p>Even a Showstopper triple kill from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/43744/akita">
		Akita	</a>
</span> to get G2 to 12-8 wasn&#39;t enough. As MIBR rose, thriving in chaotic rounds that came down to the wire, G2 began to crumble; a missed Astra pull from Vania in a 1v1 postplant at 12-10 gave way to overtime, where MIBR won two decisive rounds to complete a comeback of epic proportions and win the map 14-12 and the series 2-1. </p>

<p>bstrdd ended at the top of the scoreboard at 29/18/8, 303 ACS, and a 1.40 rating, putting up an unbelievable 22 kills and 447 ACS on defense. <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/14690/lissa">
		lissA	</a>
</span> was also hugely impactful, racking up 22 kills and recording seven first bloods on Viper throughout the map. </p>

<p>“Even if it was 10-2, I don&#39;t care, nobody cared in our team, we know our potential and we know we can win this championship,” lissA asserted in the post-match interview.</p>

<p>MIBR continues to march onward in the lower bracket, sending G2 home for the second year in a row and securing two Brazilian teams in the top four. They will next play the winners of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/581499/karmine-corp-gc-vs-kr-blaze-game-changers-2025-championship-seoul-lr3/?game=all&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Karmine Corp GC versus KRÜ BLAZE</a> for the right to advance to the lower final.</p>
