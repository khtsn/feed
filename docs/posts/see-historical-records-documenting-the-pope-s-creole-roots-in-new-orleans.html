</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The documents also suggest a story not uncommon among some American people of color who underwent such journeys: a switch in racial categorization from Black to white. One of the pope’s brothers, John Prevost, 71, who lives in the suburbs of Chicago, confirmed the family’s ancestry but told The New York Times that he and his brothers always considered themselves to be white.</p><p>As for his mother, he said, “I really couldn’t tell you for sure. She might have just said Spanish.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-d911"><span><strong>1870</strong></span></h3><p>Perhaps the earliest known record of the pope’s maternal grandfather, Joseph Martinez, is a listing in the 1870 census, taken when he was 6. Martinez’s father is listed as Jacques Martinez, 48, a tailor, while his mother, Marie, 43, “keeps house.” The birthplace of everyone in his family is indicated as Louisiana.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h3 id="link-d937"><span><strong>1887</strong></span></h3><p>Joseph Martinez married Louise Baquié, the pope’s maternal grandmother, on Sept. 17, 1887. Martinez is listed on the marriage certificate as a native of Haiti. Baquié is the daughter of Ferdinand Baquié and Eugenie Grambois.</p><p>Both of Louise’s families had long New Orleans roots. The archdiocese of New Orleans unearthed records documenting the marriage of her parents in 1864, and the baptism of her mother — one of the pope’s great-grandmothers — in 1840 at St. Louis Cathedral. The baptismal font where she received her first sacrament remains there today.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-dbf9"><span><strong>1900</strong></span></h3><p>Joseph and Louise Martinez are both recorded as New Orleans residents on the 1900 census. They had two daughters at the time, Irma and Margaret, and an aunt appeared to be living at their address. All are listed as “B” for Black.</p><p>The occupation of Joseph, who appears on Line 6, is noted as “cigar maker,” and his place of birth as “Hayti,” lining up with the origin on his marriage certificate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h3 id="link-dc01"><span><strong>1908</strong></span></h3><p>The document below from 1908, known as a settlement (or probate in other jurisdictions), divides the possessions of Joseph’s parents between their heirs. Those assets included a home worth about $800 at the time. Mr. Honora, the genealogist, noted that there are “Beaucoup New Orleans family names” among the various heirs, documenting the links between the pope’s grandfather and many other New Orleans families.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h3 id="link-dc18"><span><strong>1910</strong></span></h3><p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sbrWX-fvWylDtSDp32sChBnpY_5ebl9I/view?usp=drive_link" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1910 census</a> misspells the Martinez family’s surname on Line 35 as “Martina,” and lists their race as “W,” for white. Joseph’s birthplace is listed as “S. Domingo,” capital of the Dominican Republic (and possibly, faintly above, “West Indies”?). The record appears to indicate Joseph’s father was Maltese and his mother was Spanish.</p><p>There are now three different places of origin listed for the pope’s maternal grandfather on various historical documents: Louisiana, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Mr. Honora said it wasn’t uncommon at the time for people to change their responses to record takers — part of the challenge of such research.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h3 id="link-dc19"><span><strong>1911</strong></span></h3><p>The family appears to have moved to Chicago after the 1910 census, though the exact date of their migration north is uncertain. This is a digital record from Cook County of the birth certificate of Mildred Martinez, the pope’s mother, who was born in Chicago and later known as Millie Prevost after she married. Her race is listed as white. (Other documents, also from Cook County, indicate her birth year as 1912.)</p><p>The birthplace of her father is listed as Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, while her mother, listed here as “Louise Baquiex,” is identified as a New Orleans native. The races of her parents are not indicated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h3 id="link-dc37"><span><strong>1920</strong></span></h3><p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18CaN1SELqBDUHv40UUulCx7gnByMgRCd/view?usp=drive_link" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1920 census</a> shows the Martinez family, including Mildred, Joseph and Louise’s youngest daughter, in Chicago. The records starting on Line 31 again indicate their race as white.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Richard Fausset, based in Atlanta, writes about the American South, focusing on politics, culture, race, poverty and criminal justice.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Pope Leo XIV</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Echoing Francis in First Mass: </strong>In Pope Leo XIV’s advocacy of the poor, migrants and a more open church, many people see the new pope as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/pope-leo-mass-catholic-church.html">continuation of his predecessor</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeing the First American Pope as Hardly American:</strong> Catholics around the world were skeptical at first about an American pope.
