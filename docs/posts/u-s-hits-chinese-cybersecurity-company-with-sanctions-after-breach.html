blaming it for helping Chinese hackers infiltrate U.S. communications systems and conduct surveillance across four continents.</p><p>In an announcement, the department said the company, Integrity Technology Group, had supported a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as Flax Typhoon in a campaign to break into foreign networks between the summer of 2022 and 2023, saying it found the group had “routinely sent and received information from Integrity Tech<strong> </strong>infrastructure.”</p><p>The action came after the Treasury Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/politics/china-hack-treasury.html" title="">revealed in a letter to lawmakers</a> this week that a Chinese intelligence agency had breached its systems in what appeared to be an espionage operation, gaining access to the workstations of government employees and unclassified documents.</p><p>A spokesman for the department did not specify whether Flax Typhoon had been implicated in the attack on the Treasury Department’s systems, or whether the sanctions were merely part of a larger operation to disrupt China’s cybercapabilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The sanctions also follow the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/china-hacking-telecommunications.html" title="">much more damaging revelation</a> last year that a group linked to Chinese intelligence agencies and known as Salt Typhoon had hacked U.S. telecommunications networks, targeting the telephone conversations and text messages of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/trump-vance-hack.html" title="">an array of top political figures</a>, including President-elect Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/salt-typhoon-hack-what-we-know.html" title="">Salt Typhoon</a>, Flax Typhoon is among a handful of groups that Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly identified</a> as being linked to Chinese intelligence and responsible for a range of state-sponsored cyberattacks. The group has been active since 2021 and appears focused on targets in Taiwan and the United States, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p><p>“The Treasury Department will not hesitate to hold malicious cyberactors and their enablers accountable for their actions,” Bradley T. Smith, an acting under secretary of the Treasury, said in a statement. “The United States will use all available tools to disrupt these threats as we continue working collaboratively to harden public and private sector cyberdefenses.”</p><p>In September, the F.B.I. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/court-authorized-operation-disrupts-worldwide-botnet-used-peoples-republic-china-state" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it had taken down a network of 200,000 consumer devices in the United States and abroad that had been compromised with malware and weaponized by Flax Typhoon.</p><p>The sanctions announced on Friday generally prohibit financial institutions and individuals from transacting with Integrity Technology Group, and freeze any of its assets in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>It was not immediately clear what the breach of the Treasury Department may have achieved, but the agency represents an attractive target for state-sponsored hackers because of its Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is responsible for imposing sanctions and determining which individuals represent a threat to national security. </p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/microsoft-corporation">Microsoft Corporation</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/office-of-foreign-assets-control-united-states-treasury">Office of Foreign Assets Control (United States Treasury)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/treasury-securities">Treasury Securities</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Last Days in Office: </strong>Still stinging from the election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/us/politics/biden-regrets-reflection.html">a weary President Biden</a> is pushing for his final priorities but has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/biden-final-days-in-office.html">largely absented himself</a> from the national conversation about Donald Trump.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clemency: </strong>Biden commuted the sentences of nearly all prisoners on federal death row, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/us/politics/biden-commutes-37-death-sentences.html">sparing the lives of 37 men</a> ahead of Trump’s plan to restart federal executions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foreign Policy: </strong>Biden and his aides have boasted of how they have strengthened U.S. alliances.
