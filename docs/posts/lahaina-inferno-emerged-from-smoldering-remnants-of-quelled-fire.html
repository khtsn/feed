Residents have previously described how the flames emerged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/us/hawaii-maui-lahaina-fire-contained.html" title="">in the same area where firefighters had spent the morning battling a blaze</a> triggered by downed power lines. Heavy winds rapidly stoked the renewed flames into residential streets, leaving many with little chance to escape.</p><p>But until now, local authorities had left open the possibility that there could have been something else that triggered the blaze that swept through Lahaina. Now, in a report released jointly with the Maui County Department of Fire and Public Safety, investigators with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives concluded along with local investigators that the initial fire had never been fully extinguished — and was able to reignite and spread.</p><p>Brad Ventura, Maui’s fire chief, said at a news conference on Wednesday that a rekindled fire is something that nobody wants to see happen. But he said the department was confident in the actions of the firefighters who were on scene that day and had made the decision to depart.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“We stand behind them on their decision,” he said. “It is hard. We will be working with them, but we will be standing by them.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More than a year after the fire, Maui officials are still formulating a plan for rebuilding.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The new report traces the origin of the initial fire to power lines that broke in high winds on the morning of the fire, Aug. 8, and were then re-energized. Fire crews arrived at about 6:40 a.m. and raced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/01/us/hawaii-maui-fire-timeline.html" title="">to contain that blaze</a>.</p><p>Local fire officials said on Wednesday that the crews went beyond due diligence, suppressing the fire and remaining on scene for more than five hours after it appeared to have been extinguished. With heavy machinery, crews built fire breaks to help ensure that the area was safe. By afternoon, there were no flames or smoke or glowing materials on scene, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The last fire crews departed around 2:18 p.m., returning to their station to eat and recharge.</p><p>Within minutes, the fire was spreading again and soon began consuming homes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Jeff Giesea, the county’s assistant fire chief, said there were several theories about how embers could have smoldered but gone undetected. He said a piece of burning material might have been buried under dirt and ash until wind uncovered it again. Heavy machinery used to create the fire break could have pushed some smoldering material into an area where it eventually found new fuel to grow, he said.</p><p>Jonathan Blais, the special agent in charge of the A.T.F. division overseeing the investigation, said the fire crews had spent substantial time and resources on scene.</p><p>“I believe the Maui Fire Department did everything possible to extinguish the morning phase of that fire,” he said.</p><p>The rapid spread of the fire turned the situation into the deadliest U.S. wildfire in the past century. Escape routes were blocked by downed power lines. Cell coverage faltered. Evacuation warnings were delayed. Fire hydrants ran dry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Wednesday’s report is part of a series of investigations that have identified a range of failures in both preparedness and response. These failures have included inadequate management of parched vegetation, a lack of planning for the dangerous weather conditions and poor coordination among the different officials responding to the crisis.</p><p>The state attorney general’s office has said that no criminal charges are expected. The utility company that operates the power lines, Hawaiian Electric, has agreed to pay the largest share <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/maui-wildfire-hawaii-settlement.html" title="">of a $4 billion legal settlement</a>.</p><p>State officials have pursued new investments in managing vegetation, local agencies are working to improve their wildfire preparedness, and Hawaiian Electric has begun pre-emptive power shut-offs in areas where storms could pose a particular risk of wildfire.</p><p>More than a year after the fire, many of the properties in Lahaina have been cleared of debris, but Maui officials are still formulating a plan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/us/lahaina-maui-fire-history-rebuild.html" title="">for rebuilding</a>. Government leaders have discussed moving some residents to new neighborhoods and rebuilding historic wetlands that are a cherished part of Native Hawaiian history. Officials also face community divisions about how to rebuild the waterfront, where buildings perched over the water drew tourists to shop and dine.</p><p>Thousands of people are still waiting to rebuild their homes.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
