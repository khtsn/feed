Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, N.C.</p><p>On Friday, the Army released the names of two male aviators who were killed in the crash, but in an extraordinary step, it did not identify Captain Lobach, who was the co-pilot of the helicopter, citing her family’s request for privacy.</p><p>The issue of Captain Lobach’s identity was particularly sensitive because President Trump has blamed diversity, without evidence, for the crash. Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the disaster.</p><p>On Saturday, however, the Lobach family issued a statement through the Army that described her achievements and qualifications. Captain Lobach was an R.O.T.C. graduate from the University of North Carolina and joined the Army in January 2019. She twice served as a platoon leader and company executive officer in the 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir, Va. With more than 450 flight hours, she was certified as a pilot in command.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Army officials said on Friday that Captain Lobach was undergoing her annual evaluation flight, with Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Lloyd Eaves serving as her evaluator. Officer Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Md., and Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Ga., were also killed in the crash.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-army">U.S. Army</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How the World Is Reeling:</strong> President Trump’s order to halt most foreign aid has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/world/asia/trump-usaid-freeze.html">intensified humanitarian crises and raised questions</a> about the United States’ reliability as a global leader.</p></li><li><p><strong>Musk’s Twitter Takeover Tactics:</strong> Federal agencies have offered exits to millions of employees and tested the prowess of engineers — just like when Elon Musk bought Twitter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/technology/musk-doge-x-playbook.html">The similarities have been uncanny</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prosecutors Dismissed:</strong> The Justice Department’s campaign of retribution against officials who investigated Trump and his supporters accelerated with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/prosecutors-us-attorneys-office-trump-firings.html">firing of more than a dozen federal prosecutors at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington</a>, according to a department memo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Bureau Chief Fired:</strong> Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was fired, prematurely ending a five-year term that was scheduled to run through late 2026. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/business/cfpb-rohit-chopra.html">He was known for his aggressive enforcement and expansion of consumer protection laws</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Halt on Climate Spending:</strong> Trump’s order that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/climate/trump-ira-climate-spending-halt-jobs-construction.html">all federal climate spending be paused</a> is paralyzing federal agencies, causing confusion in states and cities, delaying construction projects and forcing some companies to furlough workers.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
