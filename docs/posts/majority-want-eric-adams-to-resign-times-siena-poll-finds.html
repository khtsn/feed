Williams, the city’s public advocate and another potential candidate, received the support of 6 percent of Democratic voters. The Democratic candidates who had already entered the race at the time of the poll — including the city comptroller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/brad-lander-mayor-adams.html" title="">Brad Lander</a>; his predecessor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/nyregion/scott-stringer-nyc-mayor-race.html" title="">Scott M.

Her office produced an investigative report in 2021 concluding that Mr. Cuomo had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/nyregion/cuomo-biden-sexual-harassment.html" title="">sexually harassed nearly a dozen women</a> while he was governor.

And 52 percent of voters — and 58 percent of Democrats — viewed Mr. Cuomo favorably. About 36 percent of Democratic voters viewed Mr. Cuomo unfavorably, which may work against him under the city’s relatively new ranked-choice voting system.</p><p>By way of comparison, just 30 percent of voters and 32 percent of Democrats viewed Mr. Adams favorably, and 62 percent viewed him unfavorably.</p><p>Christine Zhang<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-5ae85221"><span>How This Poll Was Conducted</span></h3><p>Here are the key things to know about this poll from The New York Times and Siena College:</p><ul><li><p>Interviewers spoke with 853 voters in New York City from Oct. 20 to 23, 2024.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Times/Siena polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish. Overall, more than 98 percent of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for this poll. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/us/elections/times-siena-nyc-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">here</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For this poll, interviewers placed nearly 90,000 calls to more than 38,000 voters.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree. You can see more information about the characteristics of our respondents and the weighted sample at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/us/elections/times-siena-nyc-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">results and methodology page</a>, under “Composition of the Sample.”</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The margin of sampling error among registered voters is about plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When the difference between two values is computed — such as a candidate’s lead in a race — the margin of error is twice as large.</p></li></ul><p>You can see full results and a detailed methodology <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/us/elections/times-siena-nyc-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">here</a>.
