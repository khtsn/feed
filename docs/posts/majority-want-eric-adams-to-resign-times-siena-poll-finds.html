But results showed her running about 10 percentage points behind President Biden’s numbers in 2020, suggesting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/upshot/trump-poll-new-york.html" title="">some Democratic erosion in American’s largest city</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump, a Republican, is particularly strong with men, 33 percent of whom support him, and Hispanic voters, mirroring his growth in popularity among those key groups in national polls.</p><p>Mr. Trump still has little shot of winning New York’s 28 electoral votes, but his modest gains could be a good sign for Republican House candidates in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/nyregion/ny-voter-guide-house-races.html" title="">key New York swing races</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump recently visited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-policy.html" title="">a barbershop in the Bronx</a> and is scheduled to hold a rally at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan on Sunday. It is unusual for a major party candidate to take time away from the swing states so late in the campaign, but the city provides a useful backdrop for two of the key themes of his campaign: the crime rate and immigration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Forty-eight percent of New York City’s registered voters view crime as “out of control,” while 39 percent said it was a major problem, but not out of control; just 12 percent said crime was not a problem.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>New Yorkers had more mixed views on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nyc-migrant-crisis-explained.html" title="">the influx of 210,000 migrants</a> who have arrived in the city in the last few years, often in need of city services. Slightly more — 46 percent — said that migrants resettling in New York had been a benefit to the city than the 39 percent who said they were a burden.</p><p>Concerns about crime and immigration topped the list of what New York voters said were the most important problems facing the city, at 27 percent and 19 percent, followed closely by the 15 percent who mentioned the cost of living and poverty and the 13 percent who said rising housing prices were the most important issue.</p><p>When it came to the mayor, most New Yorkers said they knew at least something about Mr. Adams’s criminal case, and 76 percent of voters said they believed he had done something either illegal or unethical.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Voters are less certain about whether Ms. Hochul should remove Mr. Adams from office: 47 percent said she should, while 43 percent said the governor should not intercede.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The Times/Siena poll did not ask about a hypothetical special election, which would be triggered if Mr. Adams were to resign.</p><p>But other Democrats appear to be in much stronger standing among voters ahead of next year’s regularly scheduled primary. Given New York City’s overall Democratic tilt, that contest has typically produced the candidate favored to win the general election.</p><p>In this case, Mr. Cuomo and Ms. James, two candidates exploring a potential run, would likely be the early front-runners, with 22 percent and 19 percent of the primary vote. Mr. Adams was the choice of 12 percent of registered Democrats.</p><p>Jumaane D. Williams, the city’s public advocate and another potential candidate, received the support of 6 percent of Democratic voters. The Democratic candidates who had already entered the race at the time of the poll — including the city comptroller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/brad-lander-mayor-adams.html" title="">Brad Lander</a>; his predecessor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/nyregion/scott-stringer-nyc-mayor-race.html" title="">Scott M.

Overall, more than 98 percent of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for this poll.

The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For this poll, interviewers placed nearly 90,000 calls to more than 38,000 voters.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree. You can see more information about the characteristics of our respondents and the weighted sample at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/us/elections/times-siena-nyc-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">results and methodology page</a>, under “Composition of the Sample.”</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The margin of sampling error among registered voters is about plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error.
