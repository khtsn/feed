But Kashmir’s fate was left undecided.</p><p>Within months, both India and Pakistan had laid claim to the territory. A military confrontation ensued. The Hindu ruler of Kashmir, who had at first refused to abdicate his sovereignty, agreed to make the region part of India in exchange for a security guarantee, after militias from Pakistan moved into parts of his territory.</p><p>What followed was the first war that India and Pakistan would fight over Kashmir.</p><p>Years later, in 1961, <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/04/27/98437164.html?pageNumber=21" title="">the former ruler of Kashmir passed away</a> in Bombay.

No Indian prime minister had visited Pakistan in a decade.</p><p>The summit — between the leaders of adversaries that each now had nuclear arms — produced signed documents affirming their mutual commitment to normalizing relations.</p><p>“We must bring peace to our people,” Pakistan’s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, said at a news conference, as Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India smiled at his side. “We must bring prosperity to our people.

A few months later, Mr. Sharif was deposed in a military coup led by a Pakistani general who, it was later determined, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/world/asia/pervez-musharraf-dead.html" title="">had directed the military incursion</a> that started the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters throwing stones in Srinagar in August 2019, days after India stripped Kashmir of its partial autonomy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atul Loke for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>After the war in 1999, Kashmir remained one of the world’s most militarized zones. Near-constant unrest in the territory brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war several times in the years that followed.</p><p>The last major flare-up was in 2019, when a bombing in Kashmir <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/world/asia/pulwama-attack-kashmir.html" title="">killed at least 40 Indian soldiers</a>. Indian warplanes conducted airstrikes in Pakistan in retaliation, but the conflict de-escalated before becoming an all-out war.</p><p>A more lasting move came later that year, when the Indian government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-jammu.html" title="">stripped Kashmir of a cherished status</a>.</p><p>For all of Kashmir’s modern history — since its Hindu ruler acceded to India — the territory had enjoyed a degree of autonomy.

Internet connections were severed. Phone lines were cut. Mr. Modi’s government began directly administering the territory from New Delhi, and it imprisoned thousands of Kashmiris, including political leaders who had long sided with India in the face of separatist militancy.</p><p>The government’s heavy-handed approach stunned observers around the world. But the results, as far as India was concerned, justified the means. A new era of peace seemed to ensue. Acts of terrorism declined.
