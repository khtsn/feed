</span>&#39;s Neon. RRQ quickly demonstrated why they had selected the map, dominating with proactive pushes, steadfast site holds, and improbable retakes. RRQ&#39;s impenetrable defense netted them an 11-1 first half despite allowing Gen.G to plant the spike six times. </p>

</span> overcome the odds to extend their lead.</em></p>

<p>Gen.G managed to scrape together a few rounds in the second half, but the gap was too wide for any hope of a comeback and RRQ closed out Fracture 13-6. While every member of RRQ put up a strong performance, it was <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4866/kushy">
		Kushy	</a>
</span> on Sova leading the charge with 19 kills to 10 deaths, 272 ACS, and a 1.53 rating.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430520/gen-g-vs-rex-regum-qeon-champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff-ubqf/?game=196429&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a> threatened to go in a similar direction for Gen.G as RRQ opened the map 6-2, thriving in firefights early on. However, Gen.G finally began to show signs of life; individual hero plays from Foxy9 and <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/34974/karon">
		Karon	</a>
</span> seemed to give the Korean squad the push they needed to bring the scoreline back to 7-5 at the half. Fully revitalized, Gen.G&#39;s defense in the second half was near-perfect as they won seven consecutive rounds, this time with the ironclad setups and quick reactions that previously characterized them as one of the most consistent teams of 2024. </p>

</span> 4Ks.</em></p>

<p>Gen.G ultimately closed out Lotus 13-8. Foxy9 led the server in a statement performance with 20 kills to 13 deaths and a 1.45 rating, while Karon followed close behind with 17 kills to 10 deaths and a 1.33 rating. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430520/gen-g-vs-rex-regum-qeon-champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff-ubqf/?game=196430&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a> was the decider. RRQ opted for the standard Sova-Breach, while Gen.G brought out their signature Viper with Neon as their Duelist of choice. Unlike the previous maps, both teams struggled to break away from one another—RRQ picked up the first bonus, but Gen.G responded with three rounds of their own. Almost every round offered something different, ranging from individual brilliance from Foxy9 to a well-coordinated A hit from RRQ to just about every level of chaos in between, resulting in a 6-6 first half.</p>

<p>Tensions in the second half rose even higher than the first. Kushy secured the pistol for his side, but Gen.G immediately won the eco round. RRQ&#39;s decisive holds and retakes got them to 12-10, but Gen.G forced overtime by the skin of their teeth and fragged out in the most important moments to win Haven 14-12 and narrowly claim the series.</p>

<p>The bracket takes Gen.G straight to an upper semifinal match against DRX, where Foxy9 will face his former team. “I will show you guys, and <span data-ref-id="19">
