The official and others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal discussions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Waltz, a traditional Republican hawk who never made the public evolution toward Mr. Trump’s foreign policy views that Secretary of State Marco Rubio did, has been arguing internally for sharp sanctions against Russia if it fails to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine. Mr. Waltz made that suggestion as recently as Monday at a meeting with the president and senior members of his national security team.</p><p>Mr. Trump has been reluctant to take anything but symbolic action against Russia, though at times he has threatened on social media to impose sanctions and tariffs.</p><p>And Mr. Waltz has been under siege by external allies of Mr. Trump for weeks, including the far-right activist Laura Loomer, who prompted the president to have Mr. Waltz fire several National Security Council staff members for what she perceived as disloyalty to Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Trump has been loathe to fire anyone from cabinet-level positions since he took office a second time, seeking to avoid the headlines about the chaos that engulfed his first term.</p><p>Mr. Trump fired his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, within four weeks of his inauguration in 2017, saying he did so because Mr. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about talks he held with the Russian ambassador. Mr. Trump ran through four national security advisers in his first term.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent for The Times, reporting on President Trump.</p></div><div><p>David E.
