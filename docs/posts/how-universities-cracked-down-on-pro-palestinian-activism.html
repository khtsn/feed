About 50 people have been arrested so far this school year at protests on higher education campuses, according to numbers gathered by The New York Times, compared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/campus-protests-arrests.html" title="">over 3,000</a> last semester.</p><p>When students have protested this fall, administrators have often enforced — to the letter — new rules created in response to last spring’s unrest. The moves have created scenes that would have been hard to imagine previously, particularly at universities that once celebrated their history of student activism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Harvard temporarily banned dozens of students and faculty members from libraries after they participated in silent “study-ins” — where protesters sit at library tables with signs opposing the war in Gaza — though a similar protest did not lead to discipline in December 2023. At Indiana University Bloomington, some students and faculty members who attended candlelight vigils were referred for discipline under a new prohibition on expressive activity after 11 p.m. University of Pennsylvania administrators and campus police officers holding zip ties told vigil attendees <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/09/penn-vigil-button" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to move</a> because they had not reserved the space in compliance with new rules.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Indiana University Bloomington, some students and faculty members who attended candlelight vigils were referred for discipline under a new prohibition on expressive activity after 11 p.m.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeremy Hogan/The Bloomingtonian</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And at Montclair State University in New Jersey, police officers often outnumber participants in a weekly demonstration where protesters hold placards with photos of children killed in Gaza and the words “We mourn.”</p><p>“They say it’s to keep us safe, but I think it’s more to keep us under control,” said Tasneem Abdulazeez, a student in the teaching program.</p><p>The changes follow federal civil rights complaints, lawsuits and withering congressional scrutiny accusing universities of tolerating antisemitism, after some protesters praised Hamas and called for violence against Israelis.</p><p>Some students and faculty have welcomed calmer campuses. Others see the relative quiet as the bitter fruit of a crackdown on pro-Palestinian speech. They worry President-elect Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/us/politics/trump-rally-campus-protests.html" title="">called for universities</a> to “vanquish the radicals,” could ratchet up the pressure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In many cases, universities are enforcing rules they adopted before the school year began. While the specifics vary, they generally impose limits on where and when protests can occur and what form they can take.</p><p>Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors and an associate professor of media studies at Rutgers, said the restrictions have made people afraid.</p><p>“They feel like they’re being watched and surveilled,” he said. “I think there’s a strong degree of self-censorship that’s taking place.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers set up crowd-control barricades at Montclair State University in November near students who were holding an event to support Palestinians.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">MSU 4 Palestine</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But Jewish students who felt targeted by protesters have praised the rules — and the speed at which universities are enforcing them — for helping to restore order and safety. Naomi Lamb, the director of Hillel at the Ohio State University, said the school’s new protest policies seem to be working well.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I appreciate the response of administrators to ensure that there is as little antisemitic action and rhetoric as possible,” she said.</p><p>Some of the tactics protesters used last semester have been met with stringent responses this school year. At the University of Minnesota, 11 people were arrested after they occupied a campus building. Last school year, some universities let protesters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/nyregion/columbia-students-hamilton-hall.html" title="">occupy buildings overnight</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/nyregion/new-school-faculty-protest-encampment.html" title="">even for days at a time</a>.</p><p>At Pomona College, the president invoked “<a href="https://www.pomona.edu/administration/president/statements/posts/community-update-regarding-disciplinary-action" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extraordinary authority</a>” to bypass the standard disciplinary process and immediately suspend or ban some pro-Palestinian protesters who took over a building on Oct. 7 of this year. A college spokeswoman said the unusual move was justified because the occupation had destroyed property, threatened safety and disrupted classes, and noted that students were given opportunities to respond to the allegations against them.</p><p>At some campuses, protesters have taken up new tactics to challenge the new restrictions.</p><p>Study-ins like those at Harvard have also taken place at <a href="https://www.thelantern.com/2024/10/photo-gallery-students-for-justice-in-palestine-hosts-study-in-for-northern-gaza-at-thompson-library/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ohio State</a>, <a href="https://tulanehullabaloo.com/67420/news/pro-palestine-protestors-hold-all-day-study-in-at-library/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tulane University</a> and the <a href="https://thedailytexan.com/2024/10/11/palestine-solidarity-committee-hosts-week-of-action-to-mark-oct-7-one-year-anniversary/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>. Students typically wear kaffiyehs and tape signs to their laptops with messages like “Our tuition funds genocide.”</p><p>“It’s kind of designed to put the administration in this bind of either you ignore it, or you enforce rules but you look like kind of a jerk,” said Jay Ulfelder, research project manager at Harvard’s Nonviolent Action Lab.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>A Harvard spokesman said that a January 2024 statement from university leadership made clear that <a href="https://provost.harvard.edu/statement-interim-president-deans-harvard-university-rights-and-responsibilities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demonstrations are not permitted</a> in libraries or other campus areas used for academic activities.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Harvard temporarily banned dozens of students and faculty members from libraries after they participated in silent “study-ins.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>During Sukkot, the Jewish holiday that celebrates the harvest, members of the anti-Zionist organization Jewish Voice for Peace set up “solidarity sukkahs” at about 20 schools including Northwestern and the University of California, Los Angeles. The sukkahs, or huts, commemorate the structures the Israelites lived in while wandering in the desert for 40 years and are often decorated with gourds, fruit and lights. JVP members added signs saying “Stop Arming Israel.”</p><p>The sukkahs were removed at nine universities, according to JVP, with administrators citing new rules prohibiting unauthorized structures.</p><p>When facilities workers arrived with power tools to tear down the sukkah at Northwestern, JVP members told them it was <a href="https://outorah.org/p/205846/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrong to do so</a> before the end of the weeklong holiday, said Paz Baum, a senior. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“They do not care about our ability or right to practice our religion,” Ms. Baum said. “They only care about limiting Palestinian speech.”</p><p>The new restrictions may not be the only factor behind diminished protest activity this semester. Some protest groups have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/columbia-pro-palestinian-group-hamas.html" title="">embraced more violent rhetoric</a> — praising Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, for example — alienating some students who had sympathized with their cause.</p><p>Some things have not changed, however: There is still little consensus about what it means for a campus to be safe and when speech critical of Israel crosses the line into antisemitism.</p><p>At Montclair State, where pro-Palestinian demonstrators have criticized the number of police officers and administrators at their events, President Jonathan Koppell said he was trying to strike a balance between “competing priorities.”</p><p>In an interview, Dr. Koppell said the officers stationed at protests are necessary to protect everyone on campus, including the protesters. He noted that demonstrations on campus have been peaceful and people have “engaged responsibly.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He added that some community members want him to prohibit the pro-Palestinian gatherings altogether, something he has resisted.</p><p>“You have a desire for some people to be able to say whatever they what, wherever they want, whenever they want,” Dr. Koppell said. “And you have some people who would like to see an environment where there’s an absolute limitation on people’s ability to protest.”</p><p>“Anybody who wants an absolute in either direction is going to be unhappy,” he added.</p><p>Even as universities crack down, administrators and faculty say the federal government under Mr. Trump could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/trump-higher-education-policy-universities.html" title="">try to force further changes</a> at institutions.</p><p>Still, much remains unclear about what could happen. His pick to lead the Department of Education, Linda McMahon, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/linda-mcmahon-trump-education-secretary.html" title="">less education experience</a> than is typical of education secretaries in the past and has publicly said little about campus protests.</p><p>Abed A. Ayoub, the executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said he did not think Mr. Trump could make campuses more hostile to pro-Palestinian protests than they already are.</p><p>“Are they going to continue with their crackdown on anti-Israel speech? I think they will,” he said, referring to universities. “That’s not because Trump is in office. They started this. It’s been happening.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabelle Taft is a reporter covering national news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabelle-taft">More about Isabelle Taft</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/harvard-university">Harvard University</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/indiana-university">Indiana University</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/montclair-state-university">Montclair State University</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/pomona-college">Pomona College</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/linda-mcmahon">Linda McMahon</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/25/us/university-crackdowns-protests-israel-hamas-war.html">1312</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Colleges and the War in Gaza</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Leaders Debated Response</strong><strong>: </strong>Messages among leaders at Harvard and other universities, published by House Republicans, reveal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/harvard-oct-7-emails-israel-hamas-attack.html">discussions on how to balance public statements about the war</a> and how to negotiate with protesters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Academic Freedom</strong><strong>: </strong>Universities have cracked down on professors for pro-Palestinian activism, saying they are protecting students and tamping down on hate speech. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/faculty-protests-academic-freedom-tenure-discipline.html">Faculty members say punishments have put a “chill in the air</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Columbia University:</strong> The university has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/columbia-professor-shai-davidai-banned.html">temporarily barred a vocal pro-Israel professor from campus</a>, saying he repeatedly harassed and intimidated employees.</p></li><li><p><strong>U</strong><strong>niversity of Michigan</strong><strong>:</strong> In a tense meeting, the school’s student government restored funding for campus activities and clubs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/umich-pro-palestinian-funding-student-clubs.html">which had been paused for months in protest of the war in Gaza</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brown: </strong>The university had made a deal with pro-Palestinian students to consider their demands if they ended a protest encampment. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/brown-university-divestment-israel-hamas-war.html">But the university board voted against divestment</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
