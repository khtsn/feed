    <h1>Inside a Pro-Harris Ad Portraying Trump as Fighting for Billionaires Like Him</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Future Forward, the main super PAC backing Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, is running this 30-second ad, “</em><a href="https://adm0.page.link/8gss" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fight for Us</em></a><em>,” on television stations in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania this week at a cost of $3.5 million, according to AdImpact.</em></p><p><em>Here’s a look at the ad, its accuracy and its major takeaway.</em></p><h2 id="link-2c6436f">On the Screen</h2><p>The ad opens on a shot of a middle-aged white woman with a concerned expression on her face. She’s the narrator, and she identifies herself as a teacher. She is shown in her kitchen, unpacking groceries and looking at the receipt, opening her mail while seated at her dining table, and briefly speaking to the camera.</p><p>Video clips show the billionaires Elon Musk, in white tie, and Jeff Bezos followed by Donald J. Trump, both in black tie. Mr. Trump is then seen in a grainy video clip addressing a group of donors from a lectern at his Mar-a-Lago club, and, under the headline “Trump,” his words are subtitled: “I know 20 of you and you’re rich as hell,” and, “We are going to give you tax cuts.”</p><p>From there, the ad spins through clips of Ms. Harris giving a speech — “Kamala Harris: cut taxes for working people,” the first of several headlines mirroring the narration says — and greeting different kinds of American workers: in hard hats and bright yellow safety vests, in a kitchen, at an electrical workers’ union and elsewhere.</p><p>As Mr. Trump is seen in white golfing attire and a white “Make America Great Again” baseball cap, gold type tees up the ad’s conclusion: “Trump fights for billionaires like him.” And white type drives it home: “Kamala Harris fights for working people.”</p></div></div>
