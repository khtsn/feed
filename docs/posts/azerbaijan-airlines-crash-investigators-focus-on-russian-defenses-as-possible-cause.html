They spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. Caliber, a news outlet in Azerbaijan that is close to the government, also reported that the country’s investigators believe a Russian Pantsir system was responsible.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>U.S. intelligence agencies do not have definitive information yet, but U.S. officials said there are preliminary indications that the plane was shot down by a Russian antiaircraft system, mostly likely a surface-to-air missile.</p><p>The Kremlin earlier Thursday warned against making any immediate judgments about the cause.</p><p>“The investigation is ongoing. We need to wait for its conclusions,” Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told reporters.</p><p>Some Russian pro-military bloggers have also pointed the finger at Russian air defenses. Yuri Podolyaka, a popular blogger, said in <a href="https://t.me/yurasumy/20097" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post</a> on Telegram on Wednesday that the airplane likely had been “incidentally shot down by an air defense system.”</p><p>Another Telegram channel, Fighterbomber, which is believed to be run by Capt. Ilya Tumanov of the Russian Army, <a href="https://t.me/fighter_bomber/19310" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> a video that it said showed it was unlikely that a bird strike had punctured the fuselage. The New York Times verified the video, which shows the tail section of the aircraft resting upside down about three and a half miles from the end of the airport in Aktau, Kazakhstan. The tail is peppered with dozens of small holes. It is unclear what caused the holes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The tail of the plane is peppered with dozens of small holes.

Flightradar24 said the available data indicated the plane had problems with altitude control, and cited images from the crash site that it said showed “puncture damage” to part of the aircraft.</p><p>The plane crashed while trying to make an emergency landing in Aktau, Kazakhstan, about 260 miles east of Grozny, on the shore of the Caspian Sea. Of the 62 passengers and five crew members on board, 38 were killed, according to Kazakhstan’s authorities.</p><p>Besides Azerbaijan and Russia, authorities in Kazakhstan said they had opened a criminal investigation into the crash. Kazakhstan’s transportation authority said in <a href="https://t.me/kolikpress/20227" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Thursday that the plane’s manufacturer, the Brazilian jet maker Embraer, would also be examining the crash along with the Brazilian Air Force.</p><p>While en route to Grozny, the flight was diverted because of fog, Russian state news agencies reported. Soon after the crash, Russia’s state aviation authority said that the plane had hit a flock of birds, causing it to attempt an emergency landing, the state-run <a href="https://t.me/rian_ru/274589" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RIA Novosti</a> news agency reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But aviation experts and military observers expressed skepticism of that account, citing the recent military activity in the area near the flight path, the available information from aviation sources and videos and images posted by survivors.</p><p>The area around Grozny has been the scene of aerial battles in recent weeks involving drones, usually launched by Ukraine, and Russian air defenses. Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security company, said in a note to its clients on Wednesday that the Azerbaijan Airlines plane had likely been struck by Russian air defenses “during an incident of misidentification.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial in St. Petersburg, Russia, to the victims of the crash.
