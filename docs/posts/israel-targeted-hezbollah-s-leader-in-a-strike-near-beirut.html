    <h1>Israel Targeted Hezbollah’s Leader in a Strike Near Beirut</h1>

The strikes appeared to have been the most intense in the area since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began last October. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The target of the strike was Hassan Nasrallah, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader?smid=url-share" title="">the cleric who has led Hezbollah since 1992</a>, according to Israeli and American officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear whether Nasrallah had been killed.</p><p>Lebanon’s health minister said the bombing had caused the “complete decimation” of four to six residential buildings in the Dahiya, a group of crowded neighborhoods south of Beirut where Hezbollah dominates. At least two people were killed and 76 others were wounded, the health ministry said, though that toll is likely to rise because others are believed to be trapped under the rubble.</p><p>The attack came just after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel gave a defiant speech at the United Nations General Assembly, in which he defended his government’s handling of the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and vowed to continue fighting despite international calls for a cease-fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dekle Beach, Fla., today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3ea1d3ca">Hurricane Helene destroyed large swaths of the Southeast</h2><p>Helene crashed ashore overnight as a powerful Category 4 storm, bringing tree-snapping winds and devastating flooding to much of the Southeast. At least 41 people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/weather/hurricane-helene-florida" title="">have been reported dead across four states</a>, though officials said that toll would likely rise.</p><p>The storm left damage stretching from South Florida into the mountains of Appalachia. In the densely populated Tampa Bay region, neighborhoods were underwater; in southern Georgia, search teams pulled trapped residents out of damaged buildings; and in North Carolina, more than two million people were under flood warnings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President Kamala Harris will make her first visit to the border since beginning her campaign, and the first since 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-71a95df1">Harris is visiting the border</h2><p>Later tonight, Kamala Harris is set to make her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/us/politics/harris-border-visit-trump.html" title="">first visit to the nation’s southern border since 2021</a>, when President Biden assigned her the task of tackling the root causes of migration.
