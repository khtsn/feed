Few, though, have prolonged a disrobing more daringly than Maria Ewing, who in the Royal Opera’s production excerpted in this clip, stands, stark and unflinching, for some 25 seconds before collapsing to the ground.</p><p>By then, nudity had become far more prevalent in mainstream culture, including on opera stages. This was a long way from early Salomes — who tended to sit the scene out entirely, ceding it to a double — and even from Mary Garden, who achieved notoriety appearing in flesh-colored silk back when the opera was still a shocker, frequently subject to censors’ bans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Grace Bumbry at the Royal Opera.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hulton Archive, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Part of the allure of the Dance of the Seven Veils over the past 120 years has been voyeuristic, sometimes fostered by the singers themselves.

The dance began with Salome (played by the renowned stage animal Karita Mattila) dressed in a version of a man’s tuxedo jacket with tails, which she removed to reveal a black halter top. This bit of play with gender, the scene implied, was a key part of her strategy in seducing her stepfather.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-c2c0364">Salome Under Attack</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-20"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/14cul-salome-dance-29457-cover/14cul-salome-dance-29457-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/14cul-salome-dance-29457-cover/14cul-salome-dance-29457-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/12/139778_1_14cul-salome-dance-29457_wg_480p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">June Anderson at Opéra Royal de Wallonie in Liège, Belgium.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Opéra Royal de Wallonie-Liège</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The Dance of the Seven Veils is, in its most literal form, Salome performing for her stepfather — and, by extension, for the audience.

Marguerite Borie’s production gives the dance some of the unsettling atmosphere of a gang rape, as Salome (June Anderson) is circled and pursued by a group of men. Part of her unveiling, in this case, is those men ripping off layers of her clothes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/arts/music/heartbeat-opera-salome-review.html" title="">A recent staging</a> by the small New York company Heartbeat Opera, too, flipped the mood from a jokey start into something far more ominous, as her stepfather and others surrounded and molested her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-24"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/14cul-salome-dance-30647-cover/14cul-salome-dance-30647-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/14cul-salome-dance-30647-cover/14cul-salome-dance-30647-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/13/139941_1_14cul-salome-dance-30647_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Elza van den Heever and Kate Lellos Doherty at the Met.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Metropolitan Opera</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Claus Guth’s new production at the Metropolitan Opera, which runs through May 24, is updated from the ancient world to a dour mansion at the turn of the 20th century.
