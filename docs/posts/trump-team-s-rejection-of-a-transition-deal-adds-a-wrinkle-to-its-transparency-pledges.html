    <h1>Trump Team’s Rejection of a Transition Deal Adds a Wrinkle to Its Transparency Pledges</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After initially missing an Oct. 1 deadline, Mr. Trump’s team this week signed an agreement with the White House that will begin formal briefings led by departing administration members. But Mr. Trump has continued to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/us/politics/trump-transition-briefings.html?smid=nytcore-android-share" title="">refuse to sign an agreement with the Justice Department</a> that would allow the F.B.I. to run security checks for transition staff. Without clearances, Biden administration officials cannot share classified information with many transition team members.</p><p>This week, Mr. Trump’s team published an <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/2024%20Ethics%20Pledge%20Trump.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ethics plan</a> for its transition staff. Though President Biden’s staff accepted the plan in its agreement with Mr. Trump, the plan may run afoul of the Presidential Transition Act, which mandates that such plans detail how a president-elect himself will address his own conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump’s plan does not appear to do that.</p><p>Representatives for the Trump transition team and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>“This engagement allows our intended cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power,” Susie Wiles, Mr. Trump’s incoming chief of staff, said in the statement on Tuesday about the agreement with the White House.</p><p>During his 2016 presidential transition, Mr. Trump signed the agreement with the G.S.A. By his inauguration, the transition had about 120 employees and disclosed $6.5 million in funds raised, as well as $2.4 million in reimbursements from the federal government.</p><p>Ken Bensinger<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
