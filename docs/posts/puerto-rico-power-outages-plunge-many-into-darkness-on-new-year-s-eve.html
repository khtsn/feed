island, which has long been plagued with widespread power outages, residents woke up with a familiar feeling of resignation and deep frustration, as officials warned that the power outage could persist through New Year’s Eve<span>  </span>celebrations.</p><p>Only about 13 percent of Puerto Rico’s 1.4 million utility customers had power on Tuesday morning in what was described as a “systemwide” blackout, according to Luma Energy, which supplies power to the U.S. territory. The company said it had restored service to about 44,700 customers — about 3 percent of those affected<span>  </span>— by 1 p.m., but did not specify how many remained without power.</p><p>Luma <a href="https://x.com/lumaenergypr/status/1874081905856885124" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that “preliminary findings point to a fault on an underground line.” It said that it planned to restore power in phases and that “the entire process will take between 24-48 hours, conditions permitting.” The company said in a separate statement that service had been restored to the San Juan Medical Center and Municipal Hospital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Josué Colón, the director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, <a href="https://www.telemundopr.com/noticias/puerto-rico/josue-colon-restablecer-el-servicio-electrico-podria-tomar-varios-dias/2677208/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Telemundo</a> that he believed restoration would take several days.</p><p>Puerto Rico has faced a series of blackouts since 2017, when Hurricane Maria severely damaged the island, including its power grid.</p><p>The blackout appeared to be significantly bigger than more recent outages this summer. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/us/puerto-rico-outage.html" title="">A blackout in June</a> left about 350,000 customers without power. In August, 700,000 lost power <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/puerto-rico-power-hurricane-ernesto.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">in the wake of Hurricane Ernesto</a>.</p><p>“We are demanding answers,” the territory’s governor, Pedro Pierluisi, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/govpierluisi/posts/pfbid02B5yhSoU7HVoXDf3bq4zs95BNVyN6uLLnGPgHKtux9rcuMzWmui6y1TgK1jSoch8El" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>. Power companies, he added, “must expedite the restart of the generating units outside the fault area and keep the people duly informed about the measures they are taking to restore service throughout the island.</p><p>Luma handles the distribution of energy in Puerto Rico, while a company called Genera provides the power. Both are private and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-power-outages-genera-luma-538a5314e5307f5dd424e9bdcf67f895" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have faced criticism</a> in recent years for the island’s often-faulty grid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Emailed requests for comment on Tuesday morning generated automated replies from representatives for both companies saying they would be unavailable until January.</p><p>Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, the busiest in Puerto Rico, said in a statement on Tuesday that it was “operating normally thanks to electric generators.” A person at the administrator’s office of the Hospital Caribbean Medical Center in Fajardo, P.R., said that the facility was operating normally, relying on four generators.</p><p>The blackout threatened to put a damper on the New Year holiday, which Puerto Ricans typically celebrate by gathering in town squares and family homes — to drink, eat typical holiday dishes and set off fireworks.</p><p>Ilia Quiñones said her morning appointment at a beauty salon was canceled because Plaza Las Américas, the largest mall on the island, had largely shut down. She was supposed to do her hair for an annual New Year’s celebration her sister hosts for about 50 relative at a ranch in Gurabo, a mountainous town just south of San Juan.</p><p>Her sister had been planning the party for more than a month, but the celebrations were now in limbo because the ranch does not have a generator. The family was now considering whether to still hold the party under the night sky using battery-powered lanterns </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Bring your own lantern,” Ms. Quiñones quipped, adding: “People are so used to this already that we’ve gotten used to mediocrity.”</p><p>Fabián and Vanessa Rodriguez woke up in Guaynabo, a San Juan suburb, without electricity and plowed ahead with their plans, which luckily did not require any electricity: a jog near San Juan’s old city, followed by a plunge at the beach.</p><p>Though they have a generator at home, they were checking their neighborhood’s WhatsApp group to see if the power had come back. It had not.</p><p>“We’re just hoping this doesn’t go on for too long,” Mr. Rodriguez said, noting that while he did not place all the blame on LUMA, he was still severely disappointed. </p><p>His wife, Vanessa, quickly interjected.</p><p>“Not me, I blame all of it on LUMA,” she said, adding that she was sorry for all the families who had planned to roast <em>pernil</em>, a slow-roasted pork dish that is a mainstay of Puerto Rican holiday festivities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Edel Cora, 35, an Uber Eats driver who was doing delivery runs in San Juan, could only grin and mask his frustration with sarcasm: “Puerto Rico does it better,” he said, referencing a well-known slogan the island’s government has used to attract tourists.</p><p>He owned a generator, but he said he did not plan to turn it on. Instead, he would get dressed after getting off work, head out and visit whichever relative had electricity, “to drink and shoot fireworks.” </p><p>“I’m not surprised,” Mr. Cora said. “No one is.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luis-ferre-sadurni">More about Luis Ferré-Sadurní</a></span></p></div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victor-mather">More about Victor Mather</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.
