Even so, some bars, restaurants and cafes without backup generators had to close, losing out on heavy cruise ship foot traffic, to the chagrin of their owners.</p><p>At a Walmart in Humacao, in eastern Puerto Rico, more people were filling their shopping carts with water bottles and lanterns instead of liquor and chips.</p><p>Ilia Quiñones said her morning appointment at a beauty salon had been canceled because Plaza Las Américas, the largest mall on the island, had largely shut down. She was supposed to do her hair for an annual New Year’s celebration her sister hosts for about 50 relatives at a ranch in Gurabo, a mountainous town just south of San Juan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Her sister had been planning the party for more than a month, but the celebrations were now in limbo because the ranch does not have a generator. The family was considering whether to hold the party under the night sky using battery-powered lanterns.</p><p>“Bring your own lantern,” Ms. Quiñones quipped, adding, “People are so used to this already that we’ve gotten used to mediocrity.”</p><p>An <a href="https://lumapr.com/pagina-de-inicio-de-la-respuesta-de-emergencia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">update from the power company</a> on Tuesday evening showed that thousands of customers’ service had been restored, but about 86 percent remained without power. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, the busiest in Puerto Rico, and key health facilities appeared to have electricity, in some cases relying on backup generators.</p><p>Puerto Rico has faced a series of blackouts since 2017, when Hurricane Maria severely damaged the island, including its power grid.</p><p>The blackout appeared to be significantly bigger than more recent outages this summer. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/us/puerto-rico-outage.html" title="">A blackout in June</a> left about 350,000 customers without power. In August, 700,000 lost power <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/puerto-rico-power-hurricane-ernesto.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">in the wake of Hurricane Ernesto</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We are demanding answers,” the territory’s governor, Pedro Pierluisi, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/govpierluisi/posts/pfbid02B5yhSoU7HVoXDf3bq4zs95BNVyN6uLLnGPgHKtux9rcuMzWmui6y1TgK1jSoch8El" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>. He added that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had on Tuesday granted Puerto Rico a two-year extension in its authorization for the use of temporary generators, to provide added capacity through 2027.</p><p>The White House said that President Biden had spoken by phone Tuesday evening with Mr. Pierluisi to discuss the power outage and offer any federal assistance needed.</p><p>Luma handles the distribution of energy in Puerto Rico, while a company called Genera generates the power. Both <a href="https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-power-outages-genera-luma-538a5314e5307f5dd424e9bdcf67f895" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have faced criticism</a> in recent years for the island’s often-faulty grid.</p><p>Hugo Sorrentini, a spokesman for Luma, said that the blackout had originated at a switch yard, a control hub of sorts where electricity is directed from a power plant onto transmission lines. At the switch yard in Costa Sur, a neighborhood in southern Puerto Rico, an underground wire failed, causing the plant to “basically trip and cause a cascading effect that took out other generation units,” Mr. Sorrentini said.</p><p>The power system is not equipped to sustain the loss of that much generation at one time, and the system shut down entirely, he said. Now, Mr. Sorrentini said, the system needs to be “ramped up slowly to prevent regression.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ivan Baez, the vice president of government and public affairs at Genera, said that all of the company&#39;s power generators that were in service before the blackout were still prepared to provide service but that Luma had to first reconnect transmission lines before power could be fully restored.</p><p>Critics of Luma, which took over operation of the power grid from the island’s bankrupt public utility, have called for reviews of the company’s progress.</p><p>Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón, who will be sworn in on Jan. 2, said on social media that “we can’t keep relying on an energy system that fails our people.” She has promised to appoint an “energy czar” to oversee improvements to the energy system.</p><p>Ruth Santiago, a member of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council who lives in Salinas, P.R., said that Congress had allocated about $20 billion in funding for Puerto Rico’s electrical system but that Luma had not made good use of that money and had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-power-electricity-budget-outage-1fa186f46591945c922864dd719295fc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deferred maintenance of equipment because of budget issues</a>. She also criticized the company for focusing on initiatives, such as installing smart meters, that do not address the larger issue of blackouts.</p><p>Juan Saca, the chief executive of Luma, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/117665/witnesses/HHRG-118-II24-Wstate-SacaJ-20240926.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Congress in September that the company “works every day to replace aging and failing infrastructure with new, reliable equipment.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“These are long-term reliability investments, not quick fixes, and making the necessary structural changes is a monumental and time-consuming task, but we are making significant progress,” Mr. Saca said, noting that the company had installed more than 17,000 poles to withstand the strong winds that frequently batter the island.</p><p>He added that previous “financial mismanagement” under Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which previously managed the island’s power network, had slowed progress.</p><p>The island’s power grid suffered from underinvestment even before the damage caused by Hurricane Maria, said Laura Kuhl, a professor at Northeastern University who has written about energy policies in Puerto Rico.</p><p>In 2019, the Puerto Rican government passed an ambitious climate policy that called for the island to operate entirely on renewable energy by 2050, she said. It also set a midway target of 40 percent renewable energy by 2025. But progress has lagged, she said, and as of now, about 7 percent of the system runs on renewable resources.</p><p>Fossil fuels, which still provide the bulk of energy generation on the island, have to be imported to Puerto Rico, which makes energy more expensive for residents and also makes the island dependent on shipments of natural gas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For now, the island was weathering yet another holiday without power.</p><p>Fabián and Vanessa Rodriguez woke up in Guaynabo, a San Juan suburb, without electricity and plowed ahead with their plans, which luckily did not require any electricity: a jog near San Juan’s old city, followed by a plunge at the beach.</p><p>Though they have a generator at home, they were checking their neighborhood’s WhatsApp group to see if the power had come back. It had not.</p><p>“We’re just hoping this doesn’t go on for too long,” Mr. Rodriguez said, noting that while he did not place all the blame on Luma, he was still severely disappointed.</p><p>His wife, Vanessa, quickly interjected.</p><p>“Not me — I blame all of it on Luma,” she said, adding that she was sorry for all the families who had planned to roast pernil, a slow-roasted pork dish that is a mainstay of Puerto Rican holiday festivities.</p><p>Edel Cora, 35, an Uber Eats driver who was doing delivery runs in San Juan, could only grin and mask his frustration with sarcasm. “Puerto Rico does it better,” he said, referencing a well-known slogan the island’s government has used to attract tourists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He owns a generator, but he said he did not plan to turn it on. Instead, he would get dressed after getting off work, head out and visit whichever relative had electricity, “to drink and shoot fireworks.”</p><p>“I’m not surprised,” Mr. Cora said. “No one is.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luis-ferre-sadurni">More about Luis Ferré-Sadurní</a></span></p></div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victor-mather">More about Victor Mather</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.
