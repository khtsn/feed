</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Taken together, proposed changes and the expiration of the subsidies could threaten the viability of the Obamacare markets themselves, which have more than tripled in size since 2014, and currently cover 24 million people.</p><p>“This bill poses a seriously existential threat to the future of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces in a way that we haven’t seen since 2017,” said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.</p><p>These losses would be in addition to those from the bill’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/upshot/republicans-medicaid-states-plans.html" title="">many</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/upshot/medicaid-republicans-work-requirement.html" title="">changes</a> to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Cuts to Medicaid are expected to cause 7.8 million more people to be uninsured by the end of a decade.</p><p>The White House is broadly supportive of the changes, said Kush Desai, a spokesman, who contended the bill would lower premiums for certain enrollees and reduce fraud in the Obamacare marketplaces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It is unclear whether the Senate, which returned from recess this week, will make any major changes to the Obamacare provisions of the policy bill or extend the extra tax credit funding.</p><h2 id="link-7df09f00">More paperwork, less generous benefits</h2><p>The bill’s changes to the marketplaces can be thought of in three large categories.</p><p><strong>By imposing additional paperwork requirements, the bill would make it harder to sign up for insurance and qualify for tax credits. </strong>The Republican bill would unwind much of the automation built into Obamacare by design. The current system allows most people to sign up for coverage and financial assistance in one online session by allowing systems to automatically ping electronic databases to confirm key details, like income and citizenship.</p><p>Instead, the bill would require more people to present original documents at the time they enroll for coverage, and require marketplace workers to manually check them. People who can’t easily prove their income is correct would not receive subsidies, with no grace period. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“It’s a huge increase in administrative costs,” said Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California, the largest state marketplace. “You can try and invest in technology, but at the end of the day it’s a lot of people looking at documents.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Obamacare plans, like insurance or 401(k) plans that people get at work, automatically renew at the end of the year. The House bill would end that practice. If it passes, enrollees will instead have to repeat the sign-up process each year or risk losing federal assistance.</p><p>Theo Merkel, a special assistant to the president who sits on the Domestic Policy Council, said the provisions were appropriate given the value of the subsidies.</p><p>“The idea of just requiring people to verify their income in some way prior to getting thousands of dollars in government benefits is a very reasonable ask,” he said.</p><p>Critics of the changes say the new paperwork requirements and the tight time frame for completing them — the bill would also halve the annual enrollment window, from 90 days to 45 — mean many people would lose coverage simply because they didn’t gather and verify documents in time.</p><p><strong>Second, the bill would make Obamacare more expensive for many patients.</strong> A proposed tweak to a federal formula would allow insurers to cover a smaller share of medical costs. Another proposal would slightly increase the share of people’s incomes they could be asked to pay for health insurance. A third would require enrollees to pay the government back any extra tax credits they received because they incorrectly estimated their income (under current law, these so-called “reconciliation” payments are capped for low-income enrollees).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Third, the bill would block many legal immigrants, including refugees and those on student visas, from using government subsidies. </strong>The Obamacare marketplaces have always prohibited undocumented immigrants from accessing tax credits, but this additional exception will cause around one million immigrants to become uninsured. Ms. Gasteier, the director of the Massachusetts marketplace, estimates that this group makes up about 55,000 of the state’s 400,000 enrollees.</p><p>“We expect they would not be able to afford the coverage that they’re in today and would drop coverage and become uninsured,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-5463e159">The state of Obamacare today</h2><p>Obamacare enrollment is at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/obamacare-enrollment-aca-trump.html" title="">record high</a>. The marketplaces include Americans who don’t get insurance from their jobs, including low-income gig workers, middle-income freelancers and high-income entrepreneurs. Much of the increased coverage is because of pandemic-era legislation that made premium tax credits <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/upshot/stimulus-obamacare-lower-costs.html" title="">more generous</a>, lowering the out-of-pocket cost to buy insurance across the income spectrum.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Growth has led to a spike in federal spending, from $43 billion in 2019 to $143 billion in 2025. The Biden administration celebrated that growth as the realization of the Affordable Care Act’s original aim of expanded health coverage. A growing body of evidence suggests that such health insurance not only protects people’s finances but also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/health/medicaid-cuts-congress.html" title="">saves lives</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But the extra spending has raised concerns among some Republicans that insurance has become too subsidized, too easy to get and too vulnerable to fraud.</p><p>House Republicans and conservative health policy experts who have advised them on the legislation say the changes in the bill are meant to ensure only eligible people get federal help.<span>  </span>They have made similar arguments about new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/upshot/medicaid-republicans-work-requirement.html" title="">reporting requirements</a> the bill establishes for the Medicaid program.</p><p>Brian Blase, the president of the Paragon Institute, a conservative health research group, has published <a href="https://paragoninstitute.org/newsletter/the-great-obamacare-enrollment-fraud/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">papers</a> arguing fraud is widespread in the marketplaces. He said the new checks would ensure that people who receive federal tax credits actually qualify for the help.</p><p>“Should people have to do something when the taxpayer is bearing most of the cost? Yes, that’s a no-brainer,” he said. “They are making a claim of government benefits. It’s not too much to ask that they spend 15 to 30 minutes updating their information.”</p><h2 id="link-1ccdcd18">What it would mean for the market</h2><p>In general, the kind of people most likely to slip through the cracks are younger, healthier people, who may decide health insurance is not worth the trouble, Ms. Corlette said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“People who are high-risk, high-need are going to crawl through broken glass,” she said. “It’s the healthy, young folks who are going to say: ‘Oh man, forget it. I’m going to go uninsured.’”</p><p>The loss of younger, healthier enrollees could unsettle entire marketplaces, potentially driving up the cost of insurance and discouraging some insurers from participating. Early in Mr. Trump’s first term, the markets were so small that many places offered few insurance choices. And some rural counties came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/09/us/counties-with-one-or-no-obamacare-insurer.html" title="">close to having no insurers</a> offering Obamacare coverage at all. In recent years, as extra subsidies and more flexible enrollment rules have helped increase enrollment, the markets have become more costly for taxpayers, but also much more robust.</p><p>“The market will become a smaller, less healthy, more expensive place,” said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Her research suggests that the biggest effects are likely to be felt in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/upshot/theres-only-one-grocery-store-in-most-rural-areas-should-we-expect-two-health-insurers.html" title="">rural areas</a>, where enrollment is more sparse and there is little competition among hospitals to help moderate prices.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sarah Kliff is an investigative health care reporter for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Margot Sanger-Katz is a reporter covering health care policy and public health for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot">Upshot</a> section of The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Emergency Abortions</strong><strong>:</strong> The Trump administration announced that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-emergency-abortion-rule.html">revoked a Biden administration requirement</a> that hospitals provide emergency abortions to women whose health is in peril, including in states where abortion is restricted or banned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crucial Global Vaccination Programs: </strong>The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/health/trump-budget-global-health-polio.html">eliminates funding for programs that provide lifesaving vaccines</a> around the world, including immunizations for polio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump and Antisemitism:</strong> President Trump’s effort to punish Harvard over antisemitism is complicated by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/trump-antisemitism.html">extensive history of amplifying white supremacist figures and symbols</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Science Funding: </strong>Thousands of scientists, academics, physicians and researchers have responded to the administration’s executive order about “restoring a gold standard for science,” which puts Trump’s political appointees in charge of vetting scientific research and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/climate/executive-order-gold-standard-science.html">gives them the authority to “correct scientific information</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Kennedy Center: </strong>Ticket sales and subscription revenue at the John F.
