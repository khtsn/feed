If it passes the initial vote, it would be scrutinized in committees and subject to further votes, including in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of Parliament.</p><p>It would be the first time in nearly a decade that British lawmakers vote on assisted dying, a once-taboo practice that has seen increased interest and legalization among Western countries in recent years. Here’s what to know:</p><h2 id="link-e4ab4f1">What is the current law in Britain?</h2><p>It is <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/publication/assisted-suicide" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">illegal</a> to assist someone in the act of killing themselves in Britain. The proposed legislation only covers England and Wales, but a similar bill is being considered by Scotland’s Parliament.</p><p>Still, it is difficult to convict someone in these kinds of cases. According to the Crown Prosecution Service, the public prosecutor for England and Wales, 187 cases of assisted suicide have been referred to courts in the last 15 years; only four have been successfully prosecuted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is not legal to assist someone’s suicide in Scotland, but prosecutors there have said it is <a href="https://www.dignityindyingscotland.org.uk/assisted-dying/the-law/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exceedingly unlikely</a> that anyone would face charges for doing so, assuming the act was fully voluntary.</p><h2 id="link-32032d0c">What is allowed in other countries?</h2><p>Assisted dying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/19/assisted-dying-around-world-where-when-allowed-esther-rantzen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been legalized</a> in many parts of Europe and North America in the 21st century. Many <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10507858/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European countries</a>, including Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain, permit assisted dying under certain circumstances. In the United States, assisted dying is allowed in 10 states and in the capital, Washington.</p><p>The policies vary, but most include age limits, medical exams, certain requirements for physical and health condition, and waiting periods. In U.S. states where it is legal, it is typically up to physicians to determine a prescription of drugs for a person seeking an assisted death, according to Death With Dignity, a group that advocates for more lenient laws around assisted dying.</p><p>Britain’s ban on assisted suicide has led some people to travel abroad to end their lives. Dignitas, an assisted-dying organization based in Switzerland — long considered a leader in assisted dying policies — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/assisted-dying-dignitas-has-helped-540-british-people-die-mps-told" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told British lawmakers</a> last year that it had helped 540 British citizens die within Swiss borders.</p><h2 id="link-705c858e">What is being debated now, and why?</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/assisted-dying-bill-parliament-kim-leadbeater-labour-mp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bill</a>, introduced by Kim Leadbeater, a Labour lawmaker, would allow terminally ill patients to end their lives with medical assistance, subject to strict protocols. Although the full details of the bill have not yet been published, it is expected that it would allow assistance only for people who had been given a limited prognosis, such as up to six months to live.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Leadbeater was able to introduce the bill after she was one of a group of backbench lawmakers selected in a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy84myxm4l0o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lottery</a> to bring new proposals before Parliament.</p><p>The debate over assisted dying practices was reignited in December, when the celebrated British broadcaster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/19/esther-rantzen-considering-assisted-dying-if-cancer-treatment-fails" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Esther Rantzen said</a> she would consider traveling abroad to end her life, given her diagnosis of terminal lung cancer. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he promised Ms. Rantzen that his government would allow a debate and a vote on the subject.</p><h2 id="link-298b40fe">How does the public feel about the practice?</h2><p>In a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/two-thirds-uk-public-continue-think-assisted-dying-should-be-legal-provided-certain-conditions-are" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent poll</a>, two-thirds of respondents in Britain said they believed assisted dying should be allowed, under certain conditions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Opponents of assisted dying initiatives in front of the Houses of Parliament in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ben Stansall/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Still, critics question whether the proposed law <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/assisted-dying-should-be-allowed-in-england-according-to-citizens-jury-13213748" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could be used to pressure vulnerable people</a>, including those with disabilities, to end their lives before they’re ready. The archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, who leads the Anglican Church, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9dn42xqg4o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the BBC this week</a> that the idea of assisted dying was “dangerous,” saying he believed it could lead to people who are not terminally ill “feeling pressured to ask for it.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3681b475">Will the law pass?</h2><p>The debate would be the first time British lawmakers have debated assisted dying since 2015, when members of Parliament <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/11/mps-begin-debate-assisted-dying-bill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overwhelmingly rejected</a> a proposal to allow assisted dying. Since then, many Western nations have legalized assisted dying, and there is increased public support for such measures.</p><p>Mr. Starmer — who supported the 2015 measure — has said the government will remain neutral in the debate, allowing lawmakers to vote according to their conscience rather than along party lines. He recently told journalists he believed the law should be changed.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
