The region is home to the Engels airfield, which hosts some of Russia’s long-range, nuclear-capable bombers.</p><p>While the ministry did not say how many drones had evaded air defenses, The New York Times confirmed that at least one strike targeted the airfield in Engels shortly after sunrise on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Videos and photographs shared by witnesses on social media and verified by The Times showed an explosion and a large plume of dark smoke rising from the base, and loud secondary explosions after the strike. The strike appeared to target a part of the airfield with several warehouses, which is described online as a weapons storage area.</p><p>The governor of the Saratov region, Roman Busargin, said on Thursday that civilians living near the airfield were being evacuated “for safety reasons” because of a fire on the base. About 30 houses were damaged overnight, he added in a post on the Telegram messaging app.</p><p>Ukraine’s military <a href="https://t.me/GeneralStaffZSU/22192" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a statement that had attacked the airfield. Kyiv has previously targeted the base, which it calls a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/world/europe/ukraine-russia-military-bases.html" title="">staging ground</a> for Russia’s long-running attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.</p><p>Russian forces also carried out further strikes on Ukraine overnight. Ukraine’s air force said on Thursday that Russia had launched 171 drones, 63 of which were shot down by air defenses. At least five people were killed and 26 injured across the country, according to local authorities.</p><p>While both Russia and Ukraine have agreed to temporarily stop targeting each other&#39;s energy infrastructure, how and when that pause will go into effect remains unclear. Those details were expected to be discussed at upcoming talks in Saudi Arabia — and Mr. Zelensky said on Wednesday night that “everything will continue to fly” until “there is an appropriate document” negotiating terms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Thursday, the Kremlin said that Russian and U.S. officials were hammering out the details for a new round of bilateral talks. Those talks will be held on Monday in Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, President Vladimir V. Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told Russian news agencies. </p><p>Mr. Zelensky has characterized some of the Kremlin’s proposals as stalling tactics to maneuver for military advantage and a better deal from Mr. Trump. On Thursday morning, he suggested the same in noting that Russian attacks had not stopped.</p><p>“Every day and every night up to a hundred drones and missile attacks also do not stop,” he <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/13633" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Telegram</a>. “With every such strike Russia shows the world its real attitude to peace.”</p><p>Nataliia Novosolova<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> and <!-- -->Malachy Browne<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Maria Varenikova covers Ukraine and its war with Russia.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-varenikova">More about Maria Varenikova</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Energy Infrastructure Strikes: </strong>Russia said it would agree to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-putin-call-ukraine-russia-ceasefire.html">limited cease-fire</a> that would stop attacks on energy targets as long as Ukraine does the same. Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia-energy-infrastructure.html">what that could mean for both countries</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Putin Digs In</strong><strong>:</strong> Although much of what President Vladimir Putin of Russia agreed to during his call with President Trump was spun as a concession, the Russian leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/trump-putin-call-russia-ukraine-war.html">stuck to the positions he has long held</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kidnapped Ukrainian Children</strong><strong>:</strong> The State Department has ended funding for the tracking of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, and American officials or contractors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-ukraine-abducted-children.html">might have deleted a database with information on them</a>, according to a letter U.S. lawmakers sent to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fresh Sushi in a Frontline Town</strong><strong>: </strong>Sushi has long been a popular indulgence in Ukraine.
