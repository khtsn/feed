    <h1>Ukraine Attacks Air Base Deep Inside Russia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Videos and photographs shared by witnesses on social media and verified by The Times showed an explosion and a large plume of dark smoke rising from the base, and loud secondary explosions after the strike. The strike appeared to target a part of the airfield with several warehouses, which is described online as a weapons storage area.</p><p>The governor of the Saratov region, Roman Busargin, said on Thursday that civilians living near the airfield were being evacuated “for safety reasons” because of a fire on the base. About 30 houses were damaged overnight, he added in a post on the Telegram messaging app.</p><p>Ukraine’s military <a href="https://t.me/GeneralStaffZSU/22192" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a statement that had attacked the airfield. Kyiv has previously targeted the base, which it calls a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/world/europe/ukraine-russia-military-bases.html" title="">staging ground</a> for Russia’s long-running attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.</p><p>Russian forces also carried out further strikes on Ukraine overnight. Ukraine’s air force said on Thursday that Russia had launched 171 drones, 63 of which were shot down by air defenses. At least five people were killed and injured across the country, according to local authorities.</p><p>While both Russia and Ukraine have agreed to temporarily stop targeting each other&#39;s energy infrastructure, how and when that pause will go into effect remains unclear. Those details were expected to be discussed at upcoming talks in Saudi Arabia — and Mr. Zelensky said on Wednesday night that “everything will continue to fly” until “there is an appropriate document” negotiating terms.</p></div></div>
