impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, for questioning in connection with insurrection charges that stem from his short-lived imposition of martial law last month.</p><p>Police buses started massing before dawn outside the hilltop presidential compound where Mr. Yoon has been holed up since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment.html?searchResultPosition=27" title="">he was impeached</a> — and suspended from office — by the National Assembly on Dec. 14. He was the first South Korean leader to place his country under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/what-is-martial-law-south-korea.html?searchResultPosition=33" title="">military rule</a> since the country began democratizing in the late 1980s.</p><p>Investigators and police officers gathered at the main gate of Mr. Yoon’s residence around dawn on Wednesday. Carrying ladders to get over barricades of buses that blocked the road, they reached the entrance to Mr. Yoon’s residence, where they held discussions with the president’s security guards and lawyers.</p><p>Around 8:30 a.m., Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer who ​serves as Mr. Yoon’s spokesman, posted on Facebook that the president had not yet been arrested and that his legal team was negotiating with investigators over the possibility of Mr. Yoon voluntarily submitting himself for questioning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The investigators have been braced for a repeat of the standoff that occurred on Jan. 3, when they first visited Mr. Yoon’s residence to serve a detention warrant. Then, they were outnumbered by presidential security agents and had to beat an embarrassing retreat after a standoff that lasted five and a half hours.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-fgqv/14skorea-president-fgqv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-fgqv/14skorea-president-fgqv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-fgqv/14skorea-president-fgqv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man stands on top of a ladder next to a bus amid a cluster of parked vehicles" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-fgqv/14skorea-president-fgqv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-fgqv/14skorea-president-fgqv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-fgqv/14skorea-president-fgqv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-fgqv/14skorea-president-fgqv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/2154db27-2b9d-57d7-890a-75ce3c346782" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A police officer climbed a ladder to get over a bus blocking the road to Mr. Yoon’s  residential compound in Seoul on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jun Michael Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Since then, the investigators have regrouped, saying they would bring in more police officers the next time they went to his residence.

The unfolding events have gripped the country, with news and social media channels livestreaming coverage.

His lawyers said he feared the investigators would detain him if he left his presidential compound.</p><p>During the last attempt to serve the warrant, the Presidential Security Service, a government agency assigned to protect the president and his family, outnumbered the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, or C.I.O., which sought to detain him with the help of the police. It deployed 200 bodyguards and soldiers to block 100 C.I.O. agents and police officers.</p><p>It was unclear how much manpower the presidential security team could muster in its efforts to stop the new attempt to detain Mr. Yoon.</p><p>A military unit guards the perimeter of the presidential compound. But after the first standoff, the Defense Ministry told the presidential security service that it could no longer use the soldiers to prevent the warrant from being served, because that was not one of their duties.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/choe-sang-hun">More about Choe Sang-Hun</a></span></p></div><div><p>Victoria Kim is a reporter based in Seoul and focuses on breaking news coverage across the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">More about Victoria Kim</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yoon-suk-yeol">Yoon Suk-yeol</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
