He was the first South Korean leader to place his country under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/what-is-martial-law-south-korea.html?searchResultPosition=33" title="">military rule</a> since the country began democratizing in the late 1980s.</p><p>Investigators and police officers gathered at the main gate of Mr. Yoon’s residence before dawn broke on Wednesday, but faced a barricade of buses and presidential security guards blocking the gate leading up to Mr. Yoon’s residence. The standoff was a repeat of when the investigators first visited his residence to serve a detention warrant on Jan. 3. Then, they were outnumbered by presidential security agents and had to beat an embarrassing retreat after a standoff that lasted five and a half hours.</p><p>The investigators have regrouped since their initial <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-detain.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">failed attempt to detain Mr. Yoon</a>, renewing their warrant and saying they would bring in more police officers the next time they visited his residence. Police officials said they planned to deploy 1,000 officers, including units specializing in targeting drug and organized crime gangs, and vowed to arrest any people who obstructed their way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Wednesday morning, with Mr. Yoon’s lawyers, lawmakers from his party and personnel from the presidential security service standing outside the compound gates, it appeared that he and his supporters were gearing up to resist the renewed effort for his detention.</p><p>Live footage of the street leading up to his compound in the morning showed a tense standoff in below-freezing temperatures, with some shoving and physical struggles at one point.</p><p>Since the first attempt to detain Mr. Yoon his<span>  </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-bodyguards.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">security guards</a> have<span>  </span>fortified the compound by deploying more buses and razor wire to block gates and walls. Mr. Yoon has vowed to “fight to the end” to return to office and said he won’t surrender to a court warrant that he considered illegal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-hgmt/14skorea-president-hgmt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-hgmt/14skorea-president-hgmt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-hgmt/14skorea-president-hgmt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Lights glow in. the dark outside a big building" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-hgmt/14skorea-president-hgmt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-hgmt/14skorea-president-hgmt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-hgmt/14skorea-president-hgmt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/14skorea-president-hgmt/14skorea-president-hgmt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7d775f66-4f6c-5aa9-8df4-56432abe7413" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When investigators first to serve the warrant on Jan. 3, they were outnumbered by members of Mr. Yoon’s Presidential Security Service who foiled the attempt.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jun Michael Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>South Korea’s acting president, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, warned government agencies involved in the standoff against violence.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“All the people and the international community are watching this,” he said in a statement. “We cannot tolerate physical violence for any purposes because it will irreparably damage the trust of the people and our international reputation.”</p><p>The effort to take in Mr. Yoon is the first time in South Korean history that the authorities are trying to detain a sitting president. The unfolding events have gripped the country, with news and social media channels livestreaming coverage. There are fears of a violent clash if neither side backs down.</p><p>A day before, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-court-impeachment.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">the Constitutional Court</a> began a hearing on whether to unseat Mr. Yoon, who did not show up. His lawyers said he feared the investigators would detain him if he left his presidential compound.</p><p>During the last attempt to serve the warrant, the Presidential Security Service, a government agency assigned to protect the president and his family, outnumbered the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, or C.I.O., which sought to detain him with the help of the police. It deployed 200 bodyguards and soldiers to block 100 C.I.O. agents and police officers.</p><p>It was unclear how much manpower the presidential security team could muster in its efforts to stop the new attempt to detain Mr. Yoon.</p><p>A military unit guards the perimeter of the presidential compound. But after the first standoff, the Defense Ministry told the presidential security service that it could no longer use the soldiers to block the serving of the warrant, saying this was not part of the soldiers’ duty.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victoria Kim is a reporter based in Seoul and focuses on breaking news coverage across the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">More about Victoria Kim</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
