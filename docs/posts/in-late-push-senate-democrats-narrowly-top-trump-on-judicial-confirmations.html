This was an accomplishment that will last generations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The intense year-end effort means that President-elect Donald J. Trump will enter the White House with far fewer vacancies than in 2017, when he took office with more than 100 judgeships open after Republicans blocked the Obama administration from filling court seats, including one on the Supreme Court.</p><p>Mr. Trump could get more if Mr. Biden signs congressionally approved legislation that would create about two dozen new federal court slots for him to fill, but the White House has said he would veto that bill.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
