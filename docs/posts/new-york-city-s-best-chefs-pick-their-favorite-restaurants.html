This year, on the occasion of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/dining/best-nyc-restaurants.html#" title="">our 2025 list</a>, we decided to pose a question to some of the chefs from the list itself: What’s your favorite restaurant in the city right now? Their answers show a perfectly New York variety of neighborhoods and cuisines. Some even overlap with The Times’s picks — but that’s purely delicious coincidence.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The Dungeness crab two ways at Wu’s Wonton King." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj/06FD-CHEF-FAVORITES1-mgpj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/1083b8ad-d9e7-59e4-b04c-33c979f8f399" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">An Rong Xu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>I like to go to restaurants that remind me of home, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/dining/wus-wonton-king-review-chinese-restaurant-nyc.html" title="">Wu’s Wonton King</a> does just that. It’s loud and chaotic in the best way, you order too much on purpose and spin the lazy susan for hours. The crab fried rice, loaded with sweet chunks of crab, is a must: I always finish the plate.

Mom up front, pops in back. The first time I ate there I was so full of joy that when the chef came out of the kitchen for a second, I just started clapping, and then everyone else joined in. I just wanted him to know how amazing his food was.

I do have a go-to order. The scallops dressed in a fiery red curry. The crispy zaab zaab wings, perfectly crunchy and seasoned with a duality of flavors. The steamed branzino still bubbling when it hits the table and draped in thinly sliced lime and herbs. Don’t skip on the crab curry and fried rice, too. Their hospitality is as warm as the flavors.

Our shop is just a mile down the road, and I grew up a few blocks away. As a kid, we would go there to celebrate special occasions. These days, it’s where I go with friends and family when I’m craving a home-cooked meal. Lately, my go-to orders are the baked clams and the tomahawk steak. The steak is always cooked to perfection, and the onions and vegetables served alongside it are incredible. I still don’t know how they manage to pack so much flavor into the veggies. I always make sure to grab a couple of bottles of their house wine. — Amit Maheepat, <a href="https://trinciti.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trinciti Roti Shop</a></p><p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rH8iP6T7KYYzi89J7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">135-58 Lefferts Boulevard (149th Avenue)</a></p><h2 id="link-5884627"><a href="https://www.sailor.nyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sailor</a></h2><p>Fort Greene, Brooklyn</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evan Sung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>I went for the first time a few weeks ago, and I couldn’t have been more impressed.

As a Lower Manhattan dingbat, going up there, it’s like a two hour Upper East Side vacation. The service is fine-dining tight but properly devoid of corny obsequiousness, and the people watching is, my god, incredible. My partner and I go once, maybe twice a year for special occasions, like it’s Tuesday and I have the night off. And, yes, we always order two Cajun chickens — every table gets the Cajun chicken. It’s not a cheap restaurant but it’s not supposed to be, it shouldn’t be. — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/dining/restaurant-review-superiority-burger-east-village.html" title="">Brooks Headley</a>, <a href="https://www.superiorityburger.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Superiority Burger</a></p><p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/cayGwkC5p25J4PqZ8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20 East 60th Street (Madison Avenue)</a></p><h2 id="link-15b679a2"><a href="https://www.smithereensnyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Smithereens</a></h2><p>East Village, Manhattan</p><p>In terms of the question of where to eat right now, I’m sticking to the East Village.

They are wok masters. I often have it on my mind. They have an old-school style of food, no compromise on flavor and full of technique from the old country. Then on the other hand you can have the best “Americanized” Chinese: General Tso, fried dumplings, egg rolls, Singapore mei fun. All the classics.

It is everything you could want from your neighborhood restaurant. It’s classic, relaxed and sexy, with food that is simple but deeply delicious, served in a snug dining room. It has a friendly bar and low lighting that makes you accidentally stay for hours. It’s hard not to return daily when the cocktails are this good, the big-bright salads are boasting the season’s latest and the pastas are this silky and saucy. I imagine it’s not easy being everything to everyone, but after 15 years Roman’s remains a New York institution showing us exactly what warm hospitality and really great food is. — Jess Shadbolt, <a href="http://www.kingrestaurant.nyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">King</a></p><p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eBzEEYqH8Pct2nCaA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">243 DeKalb Avenue (Vanderbilt Avenue)</a></p><h2 id="link-869e59a"><a href="http://www.thaidiner.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thai Diner</a></h2><p>NoLIta, Manhattan</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Thai Diner is one of those rare spots that manages to be both inventive and deeply comforting.
