Over the last four years, however, there has been a nationwide burst of political activity seeking to transform the curriculum in public schools.</p><p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/education/bible-schools-classrooms.html" title="">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/texas-bible-curriculum-public-schools.html" title="">Texas</a> have encouraged schools to imbue biblical themes into lessons, and Louisiana legislators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/louisiana-ten-commandments-ruling.html" title="">tried to require schools</a> to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom. Those states and 15 others, all Republican-leaning, have passed laws seeking to restrict how racism and gender can be discussed.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
