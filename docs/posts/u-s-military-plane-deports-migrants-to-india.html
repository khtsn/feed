More than 1,000 Indians were sent back to the country last year on commercial flights.</p><p>Officials in the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who enjoys a close relationship with President Trump, have expressed confidence that India is better positioned than most countries to deal with the Trump administration, and they have publicly expressed a willingness to accept deportees.</p><p>But Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, a minister in the state government of Punjab, where the plane landed on Wednesday, criticized Mr. Trump’s tough stance on illegal immigration and suggested that Mr. Modi’s government should do more to resist him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The Indian federal government must take this very seriously — after all, there are people from many Indian states who have been deported,” he said in an interview on Tuesday. “And what is their crime? They may have gone illegally, but it was for their livelihoods. I am greatly disheartened. President Trump must give these people another chance and, on humanitarian grounds, do a rethink of his decision.”</p><p>Mr. Dhaliwal said that he would be at the airport to receive the deportees and ensure that they were not treated as criminals.</p><p>The Pew Research Center estimated in 2022 that more than 700,000 undocumented Indian immigrants were living in the United States, more than from any country but Mexico and El Salvador. Recent reports in Indian news media said that just under 20,000 migrants were scheduled for imminent deportation.</p><p>Indians are among the migrants from around the world who have illegally entered the United States through Mexico in growing numbers in recent years. Last year, more than 25,000 Indians were arrested while trying to cross the southern border illegally, according to U.S. government data. Indian migrants also contributed to rising numbers of arrests at the northern border with Canada last year.</p><p>Hamed Aleaziz<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Suhasini Raj is a reporter based in New Delhi who has covered India for The Times since 2014.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/suhasini-raj">More about Suhasini Raj</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
