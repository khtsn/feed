Thursday that the military said were affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, killing at least 15 people and wounding 16 others, including women and children, according to Syrian state media.</p><p>In Syria, the state news agency, SANA, said Israel struck the al-Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus around 3:20 p.m. local time, damaging several buildings.</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli military said the attack had “inflicted significant damage” to a command center belonging to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militia backed by Iran. The military blamed the Syrian government for allowing the militia to operate from its territory.</p><p>“We are conducting deep strikes and striking frequently in Syria and along the Syria-Lebanon border to prevent weapons transfers to Hezbollah,” Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, said on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The attack occurred as the Israeli military continued a days-long barrage of strikes along the area south of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, on Thursday, targeting Hezbollah, a militant group backed by Iran. Israel’s military said it had killed a large number of Hezbollah fighters over the past week and had “struck and dismantled” more than 140 Hezbollah rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.</p><p>For years, Israeli warplanes have quietly launched attacks in Syria in an effort, the military says, to prevent Iranian proxies like Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad from operating there. Israel generally declines to comment on individual strikes, but over the past several weeks, Israeli officials have increasingly taken responsibility for the attacks.</p><p>Iranian news media reported on Thursday that an Israeli missile had hit a building in Damascus close to where a prominent Iranian official, Ali Larijani, was meeting with the director of Syria’s National Security Committee. Mr. Larijani was not injured, according to the Khabar Online news outlet.</p><p>Mr. Larijani, a former speaker of Parliament who is currently a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had been on a “special mission” to Syria on behalf of Mr. Khamenei, Iranian news media reported.</p><p>The Biden administration and other mediators are attempting to broker a cease-fire in the yearlong conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. They hope that a diplomatic settlement could help to end Israel’s campaign against Hamas, another militant group backed by Iran, and bring back the hostages held in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hezbollah began firing on Israel the day after the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, saying its bombardment was a sign of solidarity with its Gaza-based ally.</p><p>Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, on Wednesday said that any agreement to end the fighting must force Hezbollah to disarm and withdraw from areas near the Israeli border. Israel has also demanded that it must be able to crack down on Hezbollah should it violate the deal.</p><p>Hezbollah has so far given little indication that it would be willing accept those demands. While the group has been battered by the war, it is still managing to put up a fight, firing scores of rockets and drones into Israel daily and killing six Israeli soldiers on Wednesday in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Twenty-one people were killed on Wednesday in Israeli attacks on Lebanon, bringing the total killed since October 2023 to at least 3,386, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. Those figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In the meantime, the fighting has continued.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/14/multimedia/14mideast-lebanon-jcmp/14mideast-lebanon-jcmp-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The Dahiya, an area just outside Beirut, has been a frequent target of airstrikes since Israel stepped up its air war in Lebanon in September.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Lebanon’s state news media said the Israeli strikes on Thursday were concentrated in <a href="https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/justice-law/738601/violent-enemy-raid-targets-mraijeh-in-dahieh" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/justice-law/738596/violent-enemy-raid-targets-haret-hreik-roueiss-vic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">neighborhoods</a> of the Dahiya, the tightly packed cluster of neighborhoods adjoining Beirut that has been a frequent target of the Israeli military since it stepped up its air war in Lebanon at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-beirut-strike.html" title="">the end of September</a>.</p><p>In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said they had conducted “a series of intelligence-based strikes on Hezbollah weapons-storage facilities” in the Dahiya, which it called “a key Hezbollah terrorist stronghold.” It said the group had “systematically embedded its terrorist infrastructure amidst the Lebanese civilian population, cynically exploiting them as a human shield.”</p><p>The offensive began after almost a year of near-daily cross-border rocket attacks by Hezbollah and Israel that forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes in northern Israel.</p><p>On Thursday, Israel’s military said it had intercepted several drones launched at Israel, some toward the country’s north and at least one other toward the southern city of Eilat. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is also backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for four drones that had been aimed at northern Israel. There were no reports of damage from the drone attacks.</p><p>The United States on Thursday again voiced concerns over Israel’s intensifying bombing campaign in the Dahiya.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Certainly we would have concerns,” a State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said when asked about the Israeli strikes at a news briefing. “We do not want to see these kinds of operations in Beirut, especially as it relates to densely populated areas.”</p><p>In Gaza, Israel pressed ahead with a weekslong offensive in the northern part of the territory, which it says has become the locus of a Hamas resurgence. The military said on Thursday that it had launched airstrikes and ground raids over the past day, killing Hamas fighters there.</p><p>Israel’s offensive in northern Gaza has drawn international criticism for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/europe/northern-gaza-evacuation-risks.html" title="">heavy toll on civilians</a>, several hundred thousand of whom became trapped there when the operation began last month, according to United Nations agencies. Tens of thousands have since fled their homes.</p><p>On Thursday, Human Rights Watch released a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/11/14/israels-crimes-against-humanity-gaza" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> that accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity for forcing nearly all of Gaza’s 2.2 million Palestinians to flee their homes, and often advising them later to move from the places where they had sought shelter. Israel has said it warns residents to evacuate for their own safety.</p><p>“There is no plausible imperative military reason to justify Israel’s mass displacement of nearly all of Gaza’s population, often multiple times,” the report said. “Rather than ensuring civilians’ security, military ‘evacuation orders’ have caused grave harm.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>In a statement, Oren Marmorstein, a spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, called the report “detached from reality” and said Israel was working to uphold the international laws of war. “Israel views all civilian harm as a tragedy, while Hamas views all civilian harm as a strategy,” Mr. Marmorstein added.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A school turned shelter for displaced people was hit by an Israeli strike in Gaza City on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Issa/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
