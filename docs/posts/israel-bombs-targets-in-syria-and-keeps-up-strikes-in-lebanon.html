But the Israel Defense Forces have intensified strikes on Hezbollah’s infrastructure in Lebanon and targeted its leaders for assassination since the group began firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel from Gaza.</p><p>The strikes in Lebanon occurred the same day that Israeli fighter jets bombed sites in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that the military said were affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militia backed by Iran. The attacks killed at least 15 people and wounded 16 others, including women and children, according to Syrian state media.</p><p>The Israeli military said in a statement that the attack had “inflicted significant damage” to a command center belonging to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The military blamed the Syrian government for allowing the militia to operate from its territory.</p><p>“We are conducting deep strikes and striking frequently in Syria and along the Syria-Lebanon border to prevent weapons transfers to Hezbollah,” Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, said on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Syrian state news agency, SANA, said Israel struck the al-Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus around 3:20 p.m. Thursday local time, damaging several buildings.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A reported Israeli strike in the al-Mezzeh neighborhood of Damascus, Syria, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Louai Beshara/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Iranian news media reported that an Israeli missile hit a building in Damascus close to where a prominent Iranian official, Ali Larijani, was meeting with the director of Syria’s National Security Committee. Mr. Larijani was not injured, according to Khabar Online, an Iranian news agency.</p><p>Mr. Larijani, a former speaker of Parliament who is currently a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had been on a “special mission” to Syria on behalf of Mr. Khamenei, Iranian news media reported. No further details were released.</p><p>Israel’s military says it has killed a large number of Hezbollah fighters over the past week and has “struck and dismantled” more than 140 Hezbollah rocket launchers in southern Lebanon.</p><p>For years, Israeli warplanes have quietly launched attacks in Syria in an effort, the military says, to prevent Iranian proxies like Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad from operating there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Lebanese city of Baalbek and the wider region have seen intensifying bombardment in recent weeks. In a separate Israeli attack on Thursday in the city’s Al-Shaab neighborhood, eight other people, including five women, were killed and more than two dozen wounded, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. An Israeli strike in the southern town of Arab Salim also killed six people, including four paramedics, the health ministry said.</p><p>More than 145 health workers in Lebanon have been killed while on duty since the war began, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>The Biden administration and other mediators are attempting to broker a cease-fire in the yearlong conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. They hope that a diplomatic settlement could help end Israel’s campaign against Hamas, also backed by Iran, and bring back the hostages held in Gaza.</p><p>Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, on Wednesday said that any agreement to end the fighting must force Hezbollah to disarm and withdraw from areas near the Israeli border. Israel has also demanded that it must be able to crack down on Hezbollah should it violate such a deal.</p><p>Hezbollah has so far given little indication that it would be willing accept those demands. While the group has been battered by the war, it is still managing to put up a fight, firing scores of rockets and drones into Israel daily and killing six Israeli soldiers on Wednesday in southern Lebanon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Twenty-one people were killed on Wednesday in Israeli attacks on Lebanon, bringing the total killed since October 2023 to at least 3,386, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. Those figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>In the meantime, the fighting has continued.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/14/multimedia/14mideast-lebanon-jcmp/14mideast-lebanon-jcmp-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The Dahiya, an area just outside Beirut, has been a frequent target of airstrikes since Israel stepped up its air war in Lebanon in September.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Lebanon’s state news media said Israeli strikes on Thursday also hit <a href="https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/justice-law/738601/violent-enemy-raid-targets-mraijeh-in-dahieh" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/justice-law/738596/violent-enemy-raid-targets-haret-hreik-roueiss-vic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">neighborhoods</a> of the Dahiya, the tightly packed cluster of neighborhoods adjoining Beirut that has been a frequent target of the Israeli military since it stepped up its air war in Lebanon at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/middleeast/israel-beirut-strike.html" title="">the end of September</a>.</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli military said it had conducted “a series of intelligence-based strikes on Hezbollah weapons-storage facilities” in the Dahiya, which it called “a key Hezbollah terrorist stronghold.”</p><p>The United States on Thursday voiced concerns over Israel’s intensifying bombing campaign in the Dahiya.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“We do not want to see these kinds of operations in Beirut, especially as it relates to densely populated areas,” a State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said when asked about the Israeli strikes at a news briefing.</p><p>The near-daily cross-border rocket attacks by Hezbollah and Israel have forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes in northern Israel.</p><p>In Gaza, Israel pressed ahead with a weekslong offensive in the northern part of the territory, which it says has become the locus of a Hamas resurgence. The military said on Thursday that it had launched airstrikes and ground raids over the past day, killing Hamas fighters there.</p><p>Israel’s offensive in northern Gaza has drawn international criticism for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/europe/northern-gaza-evacuation-risks.html" title="">heavy toll on civilians</a>, several hundred thousand of whom became trapped there when the operation began last month, according to United Nations agencies. Tens of thousands have since fled their homes.</p><p>On Thursday, Human Rights Watch released a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/11/14/israels-crimes-against-humanity-gaza" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> that accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity for forcing nearly all of Gaza’s 2.2 million Palestinians to flee their homes, and often advising them later to move from the places where they had sought shelter. Israel has said it warns residents to evacuate for their own safety.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“There is no plausible imperative military reason to justify Israel’s mass displacement of nearly all of Gaza’s population, often multiple times,” the report said. “Rather than ensuring civilians’ security, military ‘evacuation orders’ have caused grave harm.”</p><p>In a statement, Oren Marmorstein, a spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, called the report “detached from reality” and said Israel was working to uphold the international laws of war. “Israel views all civilian harm as a tragedy, while Hamas views all civilian harm as a strategy,” Mr. Marmorstein added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A school turned shelter for displaced people was hit by an Israeli strike in Gaza City on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Issa/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Israel Bombs Sites in Syria and Keeps Up Strikes in Lebanon<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
