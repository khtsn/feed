So the country’s president, as well as the heads of the judiciary and Parliament huddled with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last month, according to two senior Iranian officials familiar with the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Khamenei had publicly and repeatedly banned engaging with Washington, calling it unwise and idiotic. The senior officials, in an unusual coordinated effort, urged him to change course, said the two officials, who asked not to be named to discuss sensitive issues.</p><p>The message to Mr. Khamenei was blunt: Allow Tehran to negotiate with Washington, even directly if necessary, because otherwise the Islamic Republic’s rule could be toppled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The country was already dealing with an economy in shambles, a currency plunging against the dollar and shortages of gas, electricity and water. The threat of war with the United States and Israel was extremely serious, the officials warned. If Iran refused talks or if the negotiations failed, the officials told Mr. Khamenei, military strikes on Iran’s two main nuclear sites, Natanz and Fordow, would be inevitable.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Natanz nuclear enrichment plant in Iran, which is buried about three stories into the desert.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Planet Labs PBC, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Iran would then be forced to retaliate, risking a wider war, a scenario that could further damage the economy and spark domestic unrest, including protests and strikes, the officials said. Fighting on two fronts posed an existential threat to the regime, they added.</p><p>At the end of the hourslong meeting, Mr. Khamenei relented. He granted his permission for talks, first indirect, through an intermediary, and then, if things proceeded well, for direct talks between U.S. and Iranian negotiators, the two officials said. </p><p>On March 28, Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/middleeast/iran-negotiations-trump-letter.html" title="">sent a formal reply</a> to Mr. Trump’s letter signaling its readiness for negotiations.</p><p>On Saturday, Iran and the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/iran-nuclear-talks-trump.html" title="">will hold the first round of talks in Oman</a>. If this progresses to face-to-face meetings, it would be a sign of a major concession by Iran, which has insisted it does not want to meet Americans directly. Iran still maintains the negotiations will be indirect — meaning each side will sit in separate rooms and Omani diplomats will carry messages back and forth — while the United States has said the two sides plan to meet directly. For both sides the stakes are huge.</p><p>“Mr. Khamenei’s turnaround demonstrates his long-held core principle that ‘preserving the regime is the most necessary of the necessities,’” said Hossein Mousavian, a former diplomat who served on Iran’s nuclear negotiating team on a 2015 deal and is now a visiting fellow at Princeton University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, once again affirmed that he would take military action against Iran “if necessary, absolutely,” if it fails to negotiate.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump in 2018 after announcing that the United States would withdraw from an international nuclear deal with Iran.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I’m not asking for much, they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” he said, adding, “I want them to thrive. I want Iran to be great.”</p><p>The talks come against the backdrop of a rapidly changing world order, from regional changes, to global tariffs and shifting alliances. The Iranian-backed militias in the region, Hamas and Hezbollah, have been crippled by Israel, and Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/world/middleeast/iran-general-syria-defeat.html" title="">lost a key ally in Syria after President Bashar al-Assad’s fall in December.</a></p><p>Iran’s powerful allies, Russia and China, have also encouraged Iran to resolve its nuclear standoff with the United States through negotiations. The three countries have held two meetings in Beijing and Moscow recently to discuss Iran’s nuclear program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Since Mr. Trump took office in January, Iranian newspapers and pundits have expressed concern about whether the country’s carefully cultivated alliance with Russia and China was at risk.</p><p>The Trump administration has engaged directly with Russia’s government on the Ukraine war and Iran. Mr. Trump has also pressured China to stop buying Iran’s sanctioned oil and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-issues-fresh-iran-related-sanctions-treasury-dept-says-2025-03-20/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">penalized</a> Chinese refineries that purchase oil from Iran.</p><p>Homayoun Falakshahi, head of the crude oil team at Kpler, a company that tracks oil shipments, said that since January, Iran exported about 1.6 million barrels a day of crude oil, mostly to China. His firm projects a drop of nearly half a million barrels a day if the United States expands its sanctions on China. That would have a big effect on Iran’s economy.</p><p>Economic concerns were part of the discussion as senior officials urged Mr. Khamenei to allow negotiations.</p><p>Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, a former commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corps and current conservative head of Parliament, told Mr. Khamenei that a war combined with a domestic economic implosion could quickly get out of control, according to the two senior officials who spoke to the Times about the meeting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf speaking in Tehran last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>President Masoud Pezeshkian told Mr. Khamenei that managing the country through its current crises was not tenable, the officials said. The government has announced new power cuts for Tehran this month, and for factories, threatening production lines. In the central city of Yazd, severe water shortages forced the closure of schools and government offices for two days this week.</p><p>On Saturday, Iran will be represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and the United States by the special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.</p><p>While the goals of the initial meeting are modest — to agree on a framework for negotiations and a timeline — if it goes well, a meeting between Mr. Araghchi and Mr. Witkoff would be possible as soon as Saturday, the Iranian officials said.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html" title="">The clock is ticking on Iran’s nuclear program.</a> Iran is now far closer to being able to produce a weapon than it was in 2018, when Mr. Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>After Mr. Trump exited that deal and imposed sanctions, Iran also moved to abandon some of its obligations under the deal, which curbed its uranium enrichment levels at 3.5 percent and advanced to 60 percent.</p><p>Iran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, though U.S. intelligence concluded earlier this year that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/iran-nuclear-weapon.html" title="">Iran was exploring a faster, if cruder, route to a weapon</a> if it chose to pursue one. The United Nations atomic agency, which monitors the nuclear sites, has said it has not found evidence of weaponization.</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the earlier deal was insufficient and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html" title="">that he wants a broader agreement.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On Saturday, Iran will be represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, right, and the United States by the special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, left.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>For his part, Mr. Khamenei has set some conditions and parameters for talks, according to three Iranian officials. He has given the greenlight to discuss the nuclear program — including strict monitoring mechanisms and significant reduction of the enrichment of uranium. But he said that Iran’s missiles are part of the country’s self-defense and are off limits, the officials said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Mousavian, the former nuclear negotiator, said Iran would never agree to demands by Washington and Israel to completely dismantle its nuclear program, adding that such a demand would be a “deal breaker.”</p><p>Iran is also open to discussing its regional policies and support for militant groups, the officials said, and would indicate a willingness to use its influence to defuse regional tensions, including with the Houthis in Yemen.</p><p>Mr. Khamenei appointed several of his top advisers and confidants — Kamal Kharazi on foreign policy, Ali Larijani on strategy and Mohammad Forouzandeh on military matters — to manage negotiations with Washington in close coordination with the foreign ministry, four Iranian officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Repainting an anti-U.S. mural in Tehran last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>In another sign of a softening of Iran’s position, Mr. Pezeshkian said on Wednesday in a public speech that Mr. Khamenei was open to allowing American businesses and investments to enter Iran’s largely untapped market. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The news of Saturday’s talks dominated the front pages of Iranian newspapers this week, and even the economy showed a small sign of a boost. The price of Iran’s currency, the rial, rallied slightly against the dollar on the black market. And Iran’s stock market opened with a surge for many companies.</p><p>Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the Crisis Group, an independent research group, said that, with Mr. Trump, Iran has a unique opportunity for a lasting deal with the United States and the potential to resolve a diplomatic rift nearly five decades long. Mr. Trump’s influence over Israel and the Republican Party, which has traditionally opposed a deal with Iran, would give any potential deal more weight.</p><p>“Time is too short, the stakes are too high, and the issues are too complicated for diplomacy to have a chance without the two key protagonists talking to each other,” said Mr. Vaez.</p><p>Leily Nikounazar<!-- --> contributed reporting from Brussels.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Farnaz Fassihi is the United Nations bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the organization, and also covers Iran and the shadow war between Iran and Israel.
