    <h1>Jacky Rosen Holds Off Sam Brown in Nevada, Keeping a Democratic Senate Seat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Brown’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Brown posted on X just minutes before the race call early on Saturday morning, writing that Nevada’s still counting thousands of ballots days after the election was “unacceptable,” and that “we deserve to know election results within hours, not a week later.”</p><p>Ms. Rosen, a former computer programmer and synagogue president, was seen as vulnerable, given Nevada’s swing state status. A political newcomer when she was asked by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/28/us/politics/harry-reid-dead.html" title="">Senator Harry M. Reid</a>, the influential Democrat who died in 2021, to run for office, Ms. Rosen cut a low profile as she cultivated a bipartisan, pragmatic image. That made it difficult for opponents to attack her, but also presented a challenge to Ms. Rosen’s efforts to define herself apart from a deeply unpopular Biden administration, especially to an electorate that is more transient than that of other states.</p><p>Republicans thought that made Ms. Rosen’s seat attainable as they worked to tie her to President Biden, and later to Vice President Kamala Harris. Lacking a deep bench of experienced politicians in Nevada, they turned to Mr. Brown, who has never held elected office but had a captivating personal narrative. He was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/28/us/politics/sam-brown-nevada-senate-race.html" title="">nearly killed in Afghanistan in 2008</a> when his vehicle ran over a roadside bomb, and was left permanently scarred after undergoing more than 30 surgeries during a three-year recovery.</p><p>Mr. Brown lapped the rest of the Republican field in the primary, but he quickly fell behind against Ms. Rosen, who was better-funded and bombarded him on the airwaves with advertisements highlighting his past comments opposing abortion, an issue on which he has since tried to moderate.</p><p>Mr. Brown, a relative newcomer to Nevada, struggled to gain traction and raise his profile, and surveys showed him trailing, sometimes by significant margins, throughout the fall. A televised debate in mid-October did little to change the trajectory of the race.</p></div></div>
