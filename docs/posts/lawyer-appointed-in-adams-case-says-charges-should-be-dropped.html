    <h1>Lawyer Appointed in Adams Case Says Charges Should Be Dropped</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prosecutors had argued that dismissal was necessary not because the case was weak but because it was hindering the mayor from assisting in President Trump’s immigration agenda. The motion’s provision allowing the Justice Department to reinstate charges against the mayor led Mr. Adams’s critics to argue that he would be more beholden to Mr. Trump than to his constituents.</p><p>Mr. Clement made his arguments in a 33-page brief filed with the judge, Dale E. Ho of Federal District Court in Manhattan — the latest chapter in a legal and political crisis that has called into question the probity and independence of federal prosecutions under Mr. Trump.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/nyregion/adams-case-who-is-paul-clement.html" title="">Mr. Clement</a>, a political conservative, was the U.S. solicitor general during President George W. Bush’s administration and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court.</p><p>The U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York had aggressively prosecuted Mr. Adams, a Democrat, ever since he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">indicted last year</a> on bribery, fraud and other counts. After the change in administrations, the Justice Department shifted positions and ordered the Southern District’s top prosecutor, Danielle R. Sassoon, to seek the dismissal.</p><p>She refused and quit, leading to a cascade of resignations by other prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington, while several of Mr. Adams’s campaign opponents called for him to step down.</p></div></div>
