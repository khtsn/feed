Clement, said the judge should not allow the Trump administration to use the threat of criminal charges to compel Mr. Adams’s political support. He recommended that the case be dismissed with prejudice, meaning the charges could not be brought again.</p><p>“A dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial sword of Damocles over the accused,” Mr. Clement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/clement-brief.html" title="">wrote in his filing</a>.</p><p>Mr. Clement’s brief could spell the end of the long-running case against the mayor, the first to be indicted in modern New York history. Though the judge, Dale E. Ho, is not legally bound to accept Mr. Clement’s recommendation, his guidance will likely be influential given that the judge requested that he weigh in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If Judge Ho follows it, the result could be the best possible outcome for Mayor Adams, whose administration has been in turmoil since his indictment in September. But the legal wrangling over the government’s attempt to abandon the case has left the mayor, who is facing re-election this year, even more politically damaged than he was before the process began.</p><p>High-ranking officials in President Trump’s Justice Department had asked Judge Ho to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning that the charges could be brought again. The officials did not argue that the case was weak, but rather that it was hindering Mr. Adams’s cooperation with the White House’s immigration agenda.</p><p>Their effort caused an uproar. Mr. Adams’s campaign opponents and critics throughout New York suggested that the arrangement would keep the mayor beholden to the president rather than to New Yorkers.</p><p>Mr. Clement wrote in his filing that “the prospect of re-indictment could create the appearance, if not the reality, that the actions of a public official are being driven by concerns about staying in the good graces of the federal executive, rather than the best interests of his constituents.”</p><p>If the case ends without the prospect of future charges, not only would the legal threat to the mayor essentially disappear, but so would a cudgel that Mr. Trump could wield against him to enforce his program of mass deportations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Adams’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department also had no immediate comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/nyregion/adams-case-who-is-paul-clement.html" title="">Mr. Clement</a>, a political conservative, was the U.S. solicitor general during President George W. Bush’s administration and has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court. He wrote that he had reached his 33-page conclusion in the face of the extraordinary circumstances of the government’s motion.</p><p>The U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York had aggressively prosecuted Mr. Adams, a Democrat, ever since he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">indicted last year</a> on bribery, fraud and other counts. After the change in administrations, the Justice Department shifted positions and ordered the Southern District’s top prosecutor, Danielle R. Sassoon, to seek the dismissal.</p><p>She refused and quit, leading to a cascade of resignations by other prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington, while several of Mr. Adams’s campaign opponents called for him to step down.</p><p>A top Justice Department official, Emil Bove III, filed the dismissal motion with Mr. Adams’s support. With no party opposing the motion, Judge Ho appointed Mr. Clement to help with his decision-making “via an adversarial process.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Judge Ho had made it clear that judges have little leeway in reviewing such motions and may deny them only where they are “clearly contrary to manifest public interest.”</p><p>William K.
