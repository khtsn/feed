It is the latest move in the administration’s crackdown on immigration, and will take effect on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-78b6090b">What countries are on the list?</h2><p>A full travel ban will affect citizens of the following countries:</p><ul><li><p>Afghanistan</p></li><li><p>Chad</p></li><li><p>Republic of Congo</p></li><li><p>Equatorial Guinea</p></li><li><p>Eritrea</p></li><li><p>Haiti</p></li><li><p>Iran</p></li><li><p>Libya</p></li><li><p>Myanmar</p></li><li><p>Somalia</p></li><li><p>Sudan</p></li><li><p>Yemen</p></li></ul><p>Partial restrictions will apply to citizens of other countries, meaning they cannot come to the country permanently or apply for certain visas. They are:</p><ul><li><p>Burundi</p></li><li><p>Cuba</p></li><li><p>Laos</p></li><li><p>Sierra Leone</p></li><li><p>Togo</p></li><li><p>Turkmenistan</p></li><li><p>Venezuela</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2993f541">What is the administration saying?</h2><p>Mr. Trump, who announced the ban in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/restricting-the-entry-of-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-other-national-security-and-public-safety-threats/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proclamation</a>, said it was intended to protect “the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.” It is his latest effort to further restrict immigration since returning to office in January, coming after his administration blocked asylum seekers at the Southern border, barred international students from Harvard University and ordered immigration raids across the country.</p><p>Cabinet officials in April had identified a list of countries where vetting and screening information surrounding visa applicants was “deficient” enough to warrant a full or partial suspension, the action said.</p><p>The order accused many countries of the list of exploiting the U.S. visa system and failing to cooperate with the United States on deportations. The action said citizens of some countries had a higher risk of overstaying their visas, which added to burdens on law enforcement agencies.</p><p>The announcement came days after an Egyptian man who overstayed his visa was arrested in Colorado and charged with attacking a group honoring hostages being held in Gaza. But Egypt is not subject to the ban.</p><h2 id="link-2e9f3404">What are the exceptions?</h2><p>The new travel ban does not apply to people with visas who are already in the United States, and it includes a few other exemptions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For example, Afghans eligible for the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Special Immigrant Visa program</a>, which is for those who helped the U.S. government during the war in Afghanistan, are excepted from the ban.</p><p>Other exceptions include green card holders, dual citizens and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-exceptions.html" title="">athletes or coaches traveling for a major sporting event held in the United States</a>, like the World Cup or the Olympics.</p><h2 id="link-4fed26e1">What are the reactions from the banned countries?</h2><p>The announcement provoked swift reaction from some of the affected countries.</p><p>Venezuela’s interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, called the U.S. government “fascist,” saying that “being in the United States is a big risk for anybody, not just for Venezuelans.”</p><p>The African Union released a <a href="https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20250605/statement-african-union-commission-us-travel-ban" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Thursday expressing concern and noting “the potential negative impact” the move could have on interpersonal relationships, commerce, education and “diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.”</p><p>Somalia’s ambassador to the United States — whose country Mr. Trump’s order labeled a “terrorist safe haven” — took a more conciliatory approach. The ambassador, Dahir Hassan Abdi, said in a statement that his government was “ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For immigrants from the affected countries who are already in the United States, the new policy has sparked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-immigrants-fear.html" title="">a wave of frustration and fear.</a> Many families are bracing for extended time apart as travel and reunion plans are upended by the new restrictions.</p><p>The State Department issued about 170,000 visas last year to people from the 12 countries on the list, most of which were nonimmigrant visitor visas for tourism, business or study. That is a small fraction of the millions of visas it issues every year.</p><h2 id="link-43b46f3f">How does this compare to the last Trump travel ban?</h2><p>In 2017, shortly after taking office, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html" title="">announced a ban</a> on travelers from seven mostly Muslim-majority countries. (Five of those countries are on the list again.) The move, announced in an executive order, took effect immediately and caused chaos, with hundreds of travelers being detained at airports.</p><p>After a legal battle, the Supreme Court eventually permitted a rewritten ban, and the list of countries later evolved. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ended the ban after taking office.</p><p>The new ban includes countries in more parts of the world and could affect more people than the bans Mr. Trump introduced during his first term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>This time around, Mr. Trump’s effort is more likely to withstand legal scrutiny, experts said, partly because of a longer lead-up to the announcement and the range of countries affected.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabella Kwai is a Times reporter based in London, covering breaking news and other trends.</p></div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Sending Migrants to Dangerous Countries</strong>: As the Trump administration ships migrants to countries around the world, it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/trump-deportations-migrants.html">abandoning a longstanding U.S. policy</a> of not sending people to places where they would be at risk of torture and other persecution.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Returns Abrego Garcia to Face Charges:</strong> Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/politics/kilmar-abrego-garcia-us-criminal-charges.html">flown back to the United States</a> to face charges of transporting undocumented migrants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/abrego-garcia-charges-explainer.html">Here’s what we know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Ban</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/us/haiti-trump-travel-ban.html">Sick children, families and businesses</a> are among the many people in Haiti, a country plagued by gang violence, likely to be hit hard by a U.S. travel ban.</p></li><li><p><strong>Surveillance Program</strong>: Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said that the Trump administration was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/politics/trump-quiet-skies-surveillance-program.html">ending a counterterrorism program used to conduct surveillance on air travelers</a>, contending that the program had been exploited to target conservatives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deportees in Djibouti:</strong> Homeland Security is holding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/us/trump-dhs-djibouti-deportees.html">eight deportees under 24/7 guard at a U.S. military base in Djibouti</a>.
