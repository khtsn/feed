Before his Monday evening speech <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/biden-democratic-national-convention-speech.html" title="">handing the reins</a> to Ms. Harris, they were already bracing for the waterworks.</p><p>“We were banking on him having four more years doing this,” said Rabbi Michael Beals — sometimes called “<a href="https://forward.com/forward-newsletters/looking-forward/628572/bidens-rabbi-and-i-debate-whether-its-time-for-the-president-to-step-aside/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Biden’s rabbi</a>” because of their longstanding relationship. He predicted tears.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Asked whether he thought Mr. Biden had been treated unfairly by his party, Mr. Beals responded by noting that a <a href="https://delshakes.org/summer-festival-julius-caesar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shakespeare festival in Delaware</a> this summer put on the play “Julius Caesar.”</p><p>“There’s this scene with, ‘Et tu, Brute?’ where all of his allies are taking knives and killing poor Julius Caesar,” he said. Turning back to Democrats’ revolt against Mr. Biden, he added, “I just couldn’t help but feel that some of them were his colleagues who have been around him for so long and — it was painful to watch.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-majorities-approve-president-biden-dropping-out-2024-race-dont-think-he-should-resign" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent Fox News poll</a>, 93 percent of Democratic voters approved of his decision to drop out, reflecting longstanding worries about his age that were supercharged by a disastrous debate.</p><p>And in interviews with convention attendees from Delaware, most made a point to stress their support and enthusiasm for Ms. Harris. She united her party around her candidacy with blazing speed, and the campaign reset has fueled a surge in Democratic energy after months of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html" title="">apathy and dread</a> about November.</p><p>“We have fallen in very nicely behind Vice President Harris, and we intend to support her with all the vigor that Joe would expect of us,” said Lydia E. York, Delaware’s state auditor. But, she acknowledged, “I’m not going to tell a tale, there’s a little bit of mixed emotion.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The election began with a “favorite son” at the top of the ticket, she said. “Now we’re arrived at convention, he’s not on the ticket.”</p><p>Even as many Democrats have been eager to turn the page, Mr. Biden’s allies in Delaware are focused on ensuring that he feels his party’s gratitude.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a top ally to Mr. Biden, said of the Democratic shake-up, “He’s at peace with it.

He’s optimistic about it,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally and co-chair of Ms. Harris’s campaign — who is also scheduled to speak Monday night — said in an interview. “My small role this evening is to help focus and emphasize just how grateful we all are for what Joe Biden’s done.”</p><p>At the breakfast, he led attendees through a practice round of “We Love Joe” chants, encouraging them to “go nuts” with the cheer during his speech. Some collected buttons that read, “I know Joe ’24.” The line was reminiscent of one from Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, whose endorsement of Mr. Biden in the 2020 campaign — “I know Joe. We know Joe. And most importantly, Joe knows us” — helped revive his floundering candidacy.</p></div></div><div><div><p>State Representative Kerri Evelyn Harris, the Delaware national committeewoman, said she thought Mr. Biden’s speech would generate excitement.</p><p>But, she added, noting the close personal connections many in the small state feel to Mr. Biden, “there’s going to be a sense of loss.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katie Glueck covers American politics with a focus on the Democratic Party.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-glueck">More about Katie Glueck</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2024-election-footer-carousel" data-id="100000009577677" data-source-id="100000009577677"><div>
