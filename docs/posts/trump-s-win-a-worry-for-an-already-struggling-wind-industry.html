They had “next to no orders,” said the company’s chief executive, Henrik Andersen.</p><p>Now, flush with the stimulus for renewable energy from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, Vestas is “running two shifts in the factories again,” and struggling to train people fast enough to staff them, Mr. Andersen said.</p><p>Despite this burst of activity, the wind industry overall still faces numerous challenges, including soaring costs. And after Donald J. Trump’s presidential victory, the critical question is whether the recent recovery will prove fleeting.</p><p>In recent decades, renewable industries like wind have seen sharp swings. The early <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/business/wind-power-europe.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">2020s were brutal for companies like Vestas</a>, which took a battering as the pandemic played havoc with their suppliers and inflation left them stuck with billions of dollars of unprofitable contracts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By raising prices and slowing the costly introduction of ever-larger turbines, companies have recovered financial health, although profits are still thin for an industry that needs to keep investing in new plants and technology to maintain the double-digit growth of recent years.</p><p>Vestas, based in Denmark, can be considered emblematic of the wind industry. Last week, it reported a profit of 127 million euros on €5.2 billion in revenue for the third quarter — not big money, but an improvement on the loss of €1.6 billion in 2022. “We have turned the corner on our turbine business,” Mr. Andersen said.</p><p>Today’s environment, though, is one of increased costs and reduced ambitions.</p><p>President Biden’s goal of having 30 gigawatts of wind power installed in the waters off the United States by the end of the decade now seems unattainable. Soeren Lassen, an offshore wind analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm, said around 40 percent of that number — still enough to power millions of homes — was more likely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Henrik Andersen, chief executive of Vestas, said the company had benefited from the government stimulus for renewable energy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Charlotte de la Fuente for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The British government’s ambition of roughly tripling the nation’s already large offshore generating fleet also seems out of reach. “The timeline is just too tight,” said Petra Manuel, an analyst at Rystad Energy, a consulting firm.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even that conservative expectation could prove optimistic, given Mr. Trump’s skepticism about green energy and, in particular, about offshore wind. Largely through delays in permitting, the first Trump administration hobbled what was a fledgling offshore wind industry.</p><p>The tariffs the president-elect threatens to impose on imported goods might also hit European manufacturers like Vestas. Not only is Europe at risk for tariffs, but turbine makers often rely heavily on parts from India and China, said Endri Lico, a Wood Mackenzie analyst.</p><p>Mr. Andersen said Vestas had become adept at minimizing the impact of tariffs and other disruptions in recent years.</p><p>The largest challenges facing wind, especially the offshore segment, is not what Mr. Trump may do, Mr. Lassen said, but costs, which have jumped in the United States and Europe, making wind projects more difficult to build and possibly raising electricity prices for consumers.</p><p>Bernstein, a Wall Street research firm, estimates that the price of land-based wind turbines, which sell for millions of dollars each, has increased 40 percent since 2021, while the cost of building wind farms off the United States has risen by a third, a big number for projects that cost billions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Solar power, the other main renewable technology, does not appear to be facing the same bottlenecks that have affected wind. Solar, which is continuing to get cheaper and is used more widely around the world, is on track to reach 593 gigawatts of capacity by the end of this year, surpassing industry estimates, according to <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/solar-power-continues-to-surge-in-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report from Ember</a>, a research firm.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wind turbine parts for Sunrise Wind, a large project to be built by Orsted off Montauk, N.Y.

Orsted, a Danish offshore wind giant, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/business/energy-environment/offshore-wind-energy-east-coast.html" title="">faced ballooning costs</a> on some of its American projects last year — especially those off New Jersey — pushing it to sell off holdings, including stakes in four British offshore wind farms.</p><p>The latest company to stumble is GE Vernova, whose giant offshore turbine, which looked to be a pioneering development, has turned into an albatross. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/ge-vernova-wind-turbine-blades.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">company recently took a $700 million charge</a> for losses after a turbine blade broke at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/business/energy-environment/marthas-vineyard-wind-farm-massachusetts.html" title="">Vineyard Wind</a>, a wind farm under construction off Massachusetts, and blade problems cropped up at another project off Britain.</p><p>GE Vernova recently laid off a group of managers and suspended workers at the factory that made the blades at its plant in Gaspé, Quebec, according to the CSN union, which represents employees there. GE Vernova said the company was “taking corrective actions at our blade facility.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Scott L. Strazik, the company’s chief executive, said recently that it did not foresee entering into further offshore contracts “without substantially different industry economics.”</p><p>His reluctance makes sense given that GE Vernova already has $3 billion in orders that he has characterized as loss making. But it will not help the drive to build cleaner power generation. The market needs these top suppliers to “expand capacity,” Mr. Manuel said. “But now they are actually backing out.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stanley Reed reports on energy, the environment and the Middle East from London.
