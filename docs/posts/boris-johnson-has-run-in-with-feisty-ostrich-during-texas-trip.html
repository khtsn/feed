He then grabs the steering wheel and drives away. The toddler hanging from Mr. Johnson‚Äôs arm keeps giggling.</p><p>It was not immediately clear on Monday when or where exactly the video had been taken, though social media posts by Ms. Johnson and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HCNews/posts/pfbid0uHsNnisef3EEDNHdEMA1ptnRkm2q3XLVTTziTZ7Hcvj4ALDwMbeeetzhUmHA5fEYl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local sightings</a> show the family on vacation in Texas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Other videos posted to Ms. Johnson‚Äôs account that appear to be from the same location show the family looking at deer and an aoudad, a goat-like animal. Another recent post from Ms. Johnson showed the family at Dinosaur Valley State Park, near Glen Rose, Texas.</p><p>Mr. Johnson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/world/europe/boris-johnson-covid-lockdown-rules.html" title="">was in Texas less than two years</a> ago to lobby for Republican support for Ukraine.</p><p>It is not the first time Mr. Johnson, who served as prime minister from 2019 until 2022, has been at the center of slapstick public mishaps that align with his colorful and oftentimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/07/world/europe/uk-prime-minister-johnson-resign.html" title="">chaotic tenure</a> as Britain‚Äôs leader.</p><p>In February 2021, Mr. Johnson struggled to put a latex glove on his hand at a vaccination center in Wales. It‚Äôs ‚Äúlike O.J. Simpson,‚Äù Mr. Johnson quipped, referring to the 1995 murder trial in which a glove, which was a key piece of evidence, did not fit Mr. Simpson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In July of that year, Mr. Johnson struggled to control his umbrella at a police memorial unveiling in central England.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Representatives for Mr. Johnson‚Äôs family could not immediately be reached on Monday for comment regarding the incident. Several wildlife parks in the area also did not immediately respond to requests for information about whether the Johnson family had visited them.</p><p>Stumpy‚Äôs Lakeside Grill, a restaurant in Granbury, Texas, posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stumpysgranbury/posts/pfbid02LBr1fdcsQ6LwuBkHP9WmqafiWTY52Rmbz9kSb2whU9SAqvB18mCXsTDffeXVsT57l" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a photo</a> of Mr. Johnson to social media on Saturday, noting that he had dined there.</p><p>‚ÄúWe are so honored to have him as our guest!!‚Äù the restaurant said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Livia Albeck-Ripka is a Times reporter based in Los Angeles, covering breaking news, California and other subjects.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
