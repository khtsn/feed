		<p>Rex Regum Qeon has defeated Paper Rex in their first-ever VCT Pacific best-of-five. The 3-2 victory pushes RRQ to the Stage 1 grand final, a rematch against the Southeast Asian squad&#39;s nemesis, Gen.G. Paper Rex ends the stage in third place, a result which earned them two Championship points for Champions: Paris qualification. </p>

<p>The match began on Fracture, with a dominant 13-2 win from Paper Rex. Two close maps followed, with RRQ recovering taking both Split and Pearl in overtime. Paper Rex stomped RRQ on Icebox, a 13-3 scoreline to force the series onto the decider map. A dominant attack set RRQ up for an easy win on Ascent, as the team closed out the last map 13-6. </p>

<p>The win means RRQ has the opportunity to earn a maximum of five Championship points, as well as earn a bye into the playoffs at the team&#39;s first-ever international tournament.</p>
