The police said they seized a number of books in the raids on Sunday.</p><p>The shops were initially closed on Monday, but later opened despite a judge ordering the two men, Mahmood Muna and Ahmed Muna, to remain in detention until Tuesday morning amid a police investigation. They were also ordered to be held under house arrest for five days following their release and banned from returning to their bookshops for 15 days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Famous Palestinian Bookshop in Jerusalem Reopens After Israeli Raid</h2><h4>Murad Muna, a brother of one of the bookshop owners detained in an Israeli police raid on the famous Educational Bookshop store in Jerusalem, said he was surprised by the crowd that showed up in solidarity after he reopened the store.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Is it usually this busy?” “No, today is over-busy.” “And why do you think that is?” “We were surprised from the solidarity of the people from all over the world and the local people.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/arts/10vid-jerusalem-bookshop-reopened/10vid-jerusalem-bookshop-reopened--verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Murad Muna, a brother of one of the bookshop owners detained in an Israeli police raid on the famous Educational Bookshop store in Jerusalem, said he was surprised by the crowd that showed up in solidarity after he reopened the store.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Lara Jakes/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Murad Muna, a relative of the two men and who reopened one of the stores on Monday afternoon, denied that the books sold there promoted violence.

If the Israeli authorities were seeking to make Palestinians fearful, he said, “This is our answer.”</p><p>The arrests reflected how Israel is tightening restrictions on free speech and cultural activities for Palestinians across the country. Since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israeli police have increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/magazine/israel-free-speech.html" title="">arrested Palestinian</a> citizens of Israel on charges of incitement to terror on social media and have shut down film screenings critical of the Israeli military or government in Haifa and Jaffa.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Educational Bookshop outlets are in East Jerusalem, a part of the city that Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and later annexed. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its undivided capital but most East Jerusalem residents are Palestinians, and the United Nations has deemed it occupied territory.</p><p>Over the years, the Muna family’s stores have hosted talks, film screenings and book launches, including one last July for the Pulitzer Prize-winning “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama” at another shop that they own nearby.</p><p>Its author, Nathan Thrall, was among a small crowd of protesters on Monday who gathered across from the entrance to the courthouse during the hearing. He and his wife, Judy, heard about the arrests through social media and WhatsApp groups.</p><p>He said the arrests will send “a very strong message” about police authority.</p><p>“It reflects a boldness, a sense that there will be absolutely no consequences, that they have total impunity, that they can go after two of the most well connected Palestinians in East Jerusalem” Mr. Thrall said.</p><p>David Grossman, a prominent Israeli novelist, said he knew Mahmood Muna and had visited his shop. “His arrest is outrageous,” he said in a phone interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The police also confiscated several books as part of the investigation. They did not return repeated calls and messages on Monday about their titles, content or how they were deemed offensive.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/EUpalestinians/status/1888939062100111369" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diplomats</a> from nine European countries, plus the European Union, attended the court hearing on Monday to show support for the two men. “I, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop,” the German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, <a href="https://x.com/gerambtlv/status/1888859490801287252?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a social media post</a>. ”I am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison.”</p><p>An Israeli human rights group, Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said the arrests were another step in efforts to intimidate and silence Palestinians by the Israeli authorities.</p><p>In a statement, the group added that the raids and arrests “cannot be separated from the unprecedented number of interrogations and arrests of Palestinians over expression-related offenses, nor from the broader trend of silencing the Palestinian voice and any social initiative or activity.”</p><p>Standing among the protesters at the courthouse, Eliana Padwa said she had visited the bookstores often since moving to Jerusalem from New York.</p><p>“They’ve been huge in my journey throughout the years, politically, learning about Palestine,” said Ms. Padwa, 26. “They provided a safe space for me to learn about this, to ask questions.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Feb. 10, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the relationship of the two men who were arrested at the Educational Bookshops.
