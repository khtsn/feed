The raid is part of a “political persecution aimed at silencing our voice in the public sphere,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Germany’s ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, wrote on X that he knew the Munas, the owners of the Educational Bookshop, which operates the two stores that were raided, as “peace-loving, proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open to discussion and intellectual exchange.”</p><p>Since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israeli police have increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/magazine/israel-free-speech.html" title="">arrested Palestinian</a> citizens of Israel on charges of incitement to terror on social media and have shut down film screenings critical of the Israeli military or government in Haifa and Jaffa.</p><p>The Educational Bookshop’s outlets are in East Jerusalem, a part of the city that Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and later annexed. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its undivided capital but most East Jerusalem residents are Palestinians, and the United Nations has deemed it occupied territory.</p><p>On Monday morning, protesters gathered outside a court in Jerusalem that was deliberating on the detention of the two men.</p><p>The brothers’ lawyer, Nasser Oday, said the two men would remain in detention until Tuesday morning, then be under house arrest for five days, pending an investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mai Muna, the wife of Mahmoud Muna, said the police went into the bookstores on the main commercial road in East Jerusalem around 3 p.m. on Sunday.</p><p>“They started throwing books off the shelves,” Ms. Muna said in a phone interview on Monday as she waited at the courthouse for her husband’s hearing. “They didn’t speak any English — they were looking for anything with a Palestinian flag.”</p><p>The two stores and a cafe have for decades been a cornerstone of Palestinian cultural and educational life in East Jerusalem, serving both locals and people from abroad and hosting talks and film screenings.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
