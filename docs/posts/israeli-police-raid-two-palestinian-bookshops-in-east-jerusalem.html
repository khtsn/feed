The police said they seized a number of books in the raids on Sunday.</p><p>The shops were initially closed on Monday, but later opened despite a judge ordering the brothers who own the stores, Mahmood Muna and Ahmed Muna, to remain in detention until Tuesday morning amid a police investigation. They were also ordered to be held under house arrest for five days following their release and banned from returning to their bookshops for 15 days.</p><p>Murad Muna, a brother of the two owners who reopened one of the stores on Monday afternoon, denied that the books sold there promoted violence. In fact, he said, the books passed Israeli censors when they were imported from abroad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We believe that this is a political, not a legal detention,” the lawyer for the two arrested men, Nasser Oday, said outside the courthouse in Jerusalem after the hearing.</p><p>In a statement, the police said the shops were searched on Sunday for books suspected of containing “inciting content.” It said detectives “encountered numerous books containing inciteful material with nationalist Palestinian themes, including a children’s coloring book titled ‘From the Jordan to the Sea.’”</p><p>The slogan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/world/europe/germany-river-to-sea-chant-fine.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">“from the river to the sea”</a> has long been a rallying cry for Palestinian nationalism and is usually interpreted by Israelis as a denial of their country’s right to exist.</p><p>Mahmood Muna&#39;s wife, Mai Muna, was in the courtroom on Monday as her husband was brought before the judge after spending the night in jail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ahmed Muna, left rear, and his brother Mahmood in court after their arrest on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Illean/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“They started throwing books off the shelves,” Ms. Muna said in a phone interview on Monday, describing the raids. “They were looking for anything with a Palestinian flag.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But hours later, one of the shops was jammed with customers and supporters as Murad Muna tried to keep up with nonstop sales that he said were a sign of solidarity.</p><p>“Today is overbusy,” Mr. Muna said from behind the cash register. If the Israeli authorities were seeking to make Palestinians fearful, he said, “This is our answer.”</p><p>The arrests reflected how Israel is tightening restrictions on free speech and cultural activities for Palestinians across the country. Since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israeli police have increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/magazine/israel-free-speech.html" title="">arrested Palestinian</a> citizens of Israel on charges of incitement to terror on social media and have shut down film screenings critical of the Israeli military or government in Haifa and Jaffa.</p><p>The Educational Bookshop outlets are in East Jerusalem, a part of the city that Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and later annexed. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its undivided capital but most East Jerusalem residents are Palestinians, and the United Nations has deemed it occupied territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Over the years, the Muna brothers’ stores have hosted talks, film screenings and book launches, including one last July for the Pulitzer Prize-winning “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama” at another shop that they own nearby.</p><p>Its author, Nathan Thrall, was among a small crowd of protesters on Monday who gathered across from the entrance to the courthouse during the hearing. He and his wife, Judy, heard about the arrests through social media and WhatsApp groups.</p><p>He said the arrests will send “a very strong message” about police authority.</p><p>“It reflects a boldness, a sense that there will be absolutely no consequences, that they have total impunity, that they can go after two of the most well connected Palestinians in East Jerusalem” Mr. Thrall said.</p><p>David Grossman, a prominent Israeli novelist, said he knew Mahmood Muna and had visited his shop. “His arrest is outrageous,” he said in a phone interview.</p><p>The police also confiscated several books as part of the investigation. They did not return repeated calls and messages on Monday about their titles, content or how they were deemed offensive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Several foreign diplomats attended the court hearing on Monday to show support for the Muna brothers. In a social media post, the German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, called them “peace-loving, proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open to discussion and intellectual exchange.”</p><p>An Israeli human rights group, Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said the arrests were another step in efforts to intimidate and silence Palestinians by the Israeli authorities.</p><p>In a statement, the group added that the raids and arrests “cannot be separated from the unprecedented number of interrogations and arrests of Palestinians over expression-related offenses, nor from the broader trend of silencing the Palestinian voice and any social initiative or activity.”</p><p>Standing among the protesters at the courthouse, Eliana Padwa said she had visited the bookstores often since moving to Jerusalem from New York.</p><p>“They’ve been huge in my journey throughout the years, politically, learning about Palestine,” said Ms. Padwa, 26. “They provided a safe space for me to learn about this, to ask questions.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
