    <h1>Jimmy Carter Casts His Ballot for Harris in Georgia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elections officials said they were not certain when Mr. Carter, who spent many days of his post-presidency on Carter Center election-monitoring missions around the world, first cast a ballot of his own. But in 1943, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1943/08/05/archives/georgia-approves-vote-at-age-of-18-balloting-backs-all-28-changes.html" title="">Georgia became the first state to lower its voting age to 18</a>; when Georgia voters decided to amend the state Constitution, Mr. Carter was months away from his 19th birthday.</p><p>Soon enough, though, he was in elected office himself. In 1962, he won a seat in the State Senate, after a chaotic scandal in which Mr. Carter’s opponent initially benefited from a ballot-stuffing scheme. (Decades later, Mr. Carter would <a href="https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/the-first-campaign-an-excerpt-from-jimmy-carters-new-memoir-a-full-life/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recall</a> that he was such an unknown then that a Georgia newspaper identified him as “Jerry Carter from Plains.”)</p><p>Mr. Carter cited the episode as a reason that he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/19/us/politics/rosalynn-carter-dead.html" title="">who died last year</a>, founded the Carter Center, a nongovernmental organization, after they left the White House in 1981. But before his defeat by Ronald Reagan, one of Mr. Carter’s earliest lobbying efforts as president <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/election-reform-message-the-congress" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focused on his ideas</a> about voter registration and campaign finance.</p><p>State records show that Mr. Carter has been an especially reliable voter as a former president. He has routinely cast ballots in general elections, of course, but has also been a fixture of primary runoffs and special elections. For more than a decade, he has exclusively voted by mail in the elections tracked by the state.</p><p>Mr. Carter still lives in Plains — the tidy city in southwest Georgia that he turned into an outpost of presidential politics nearly a half-century ago — and votes in Sumter County, where plenty of people still know him as “Mr. Jimmy.” A Republican presidential nominee last carried Sumter in 2004, when George W. Bush won it by 126 votes. </p></div></div>
