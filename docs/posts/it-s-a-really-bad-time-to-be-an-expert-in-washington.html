Sanger has covered six presidencies over more than four decades as a Times foreign correspondent and White House correspondent.</p></div></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2025-06-06T05:01:05-04:00">June 6, 2025, <span>5:01 a.m. ET</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The most dangerous occupation in Washington these days is being an expert.</p><p>Across West Executive Avenue from the White House, the offices that once buzzed with specialists at the National Security Council are now half vacant. Their dismissal reflects an administration not especially interested in the policy options developed by the specialists — many drawn from the State Department or the C.I.A. — who stayed deep into the night pressure-testing alternatives to immediate and long-simmering crises.</p><p>As Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters this week, the old structure did not fit the “top-down approach” of President Trump, who views the institution’s proper role as carrying out his decisions.</p><p>At the Pentagon, 14 advisory boards have been dismantled, with curt, thank-you-for-your-service notes sent to Democrats and Republicans alike. Some of the boards dealt with obscure matters. But others focused on vital issues, like rethinking the American nuclear arsenal as China’s nuclear buildup, Vladimir V. Putin’s episodic nuclear threats and Mr. Trump’s ambitious demand for a “Golden Dome” missile defense system have changed the nature of nuclear strategy.</p><p>Also gone: The board of experts who were trying to learn lessons from China’s astoundingly successful hack into the country’s telecommunications networks — where, by all accounts, they remain to this day. Then came historians at the State Department and the climate specialists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which employed experts in weather, oceans, climate and biodiversity. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The National Weather Service lost so many people that the agency had to hire them back. No such luck for researchers relying on the National Science Foundation, where projects are disappearing every month.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where many of the dismissed members of the National Security Council worked. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>No one killed off the expert advisory board at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as it deliberated whether healthy children should receive the Covid vaccine. They did not have to. While it weighed the pros and cons, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues announced that they had already made their decision.</p><p>When the history of these tumultuous past four months is written, it will doubtless focus on the moments when teams from the Department of Government Efficiency shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, when the president issued tariff threats to much of the world and when he went to war with Harvard. Less noticed, perhaps, may be the devastation of the expert class, which once dominated the city, moving between think tanks and government offices, generating alternative views in its best moments, engaging in groupthink at its worst.</p><p>Today, the experts are swelling the ranks of Washington’s suddenly unemployed.</p><p>To the MAGA faithful, each one of these disbanded groups is a victory for a trimmer government that follows the president’s wishes. To them, the National Security Council was the heart of the so-called deep state, whose members testified against Mr. Trump during his first impeachment inquiry. The raft of advisory committees mostly slowed down decision making, they argued, when they were not undercutting policies they did not like. Worse yet, they were the source of leaks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>So if an advisory committee of experts was not needed to help James K. Polk, the 11th president, figure out how to spread the United States to the West Coast, why do we need them to figure out the strategy for adding Greenland and Canada? (The expansionist Mr. Polk has been restored to a place of pride in the Oval Office — his portrait now hangs just below and to the right of Thomas Jefferson’s.)</p><p>Part of Mr. Trump’s problem with experts is their portrayal as neutral arbiters, more interested in the data than presidential spin. That is what has led to the White House this week trying to to discredit the Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that, yes, the new tax bill could really add $2.4 trillion to the national debt, no matter the spin. Lacking the authority to fire the budget experts there, the White House turned to casting them as politically biased.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rather than being informed by experts, Mr. Trump’s demand for a “Golden Dome” defense project has changed the nature of nuclear strategy. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And while every new president replaces board members and demands some fealty to the new leader’s ideology, what has happened in the past four months seems to some in the federal government more like China’s cultural revolution, where the only good ideas are the ones that flow from the leader, and both research reports and intelligence findings should support the president’s desires.</p><p>And when they are not, trouble follows. Just ask the National Intelligence Council, a small subset of intelligence experts — many drawn from academia — what happened when they came to the conclusion that the Venezuelan government was not controlling a criminal gang, an argument that Mr. Trump had used to justify deportations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>They were told to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/gabbard-intelligence-venezuelans-tren-de-aragua-trump.html" title="">“do some rewriting”</a> so the material could not be used against the president and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence. After the intelligence findings were left unchanged, the board’s leadership resisted and was removed. The whole institution is being moved into Ms. Gabbard’s organization, where its independent judgments can be better controlled.</p><p>At the Environmental Protection Agency, self-protective action has replaced scientific inquiry. “We’ve taken the words ‘climate’ and ‘green energy’ off every project document,” one scientist still in the government’s employ said recently, refusing to speak on the record for obvious reasons.</p><p>Veterans of Mr. Trump’s first term say these changes are a manifestation of the president’s bitter memories. “I think somebody convinced President Trump, based on his experience in his first administration, that his own staff would be the biggest obstructionists,” H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump’s second national security adviser, said at a conference on artificial intelligence and national security on Wednesday. (Mr. Trump’s current national security adviser, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is one of around a half dozen across both terms.)</p><p>While General McMaster, now at Stanford, said he did not object to shrinking the National Security Council staff, he worried that also lost would be the capacity to run “a deliberative process, which I think would be kind of nice on some of these issues, like tariffs, to clarify what you are trying to achieve.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Deliberative process” appears to be exactly what Mr. Trump is trying to avoid. And if that means eviscerating the expert class, so be it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>H.R.

General McMaster is hardly alone in concluding that some of the aid agency’s programs had “drifted.” Many Democrats say they agree, though almost never on the record.</p><p>But General McMaster gave voice to the question raised all over Washington when he asked, “Should you just crush the entire organization or recognize there is a mission for that organization to advance American interests?”</p><p>It was crushed, with foreign service officers, child health experts and others locked out of the offices. And that has led to both professional and personal angst.</p><p>“If you work in the field of maternal and child health, you are in trouble,” said Jessica Harrison Fullerton, a managing director at the Global Development Incubator, a nonprofit that is trying to fill some of the gaps U.S.A.I.D.’s dismantlement left. “Not only are you devastated by the impacts on the people you have been serving, but your expertise is now being questioned and your ability to use that expertise is limited because the jobs are gone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In fact, what many of Washington’s experts discovered was that crushing the organizations — and putting their experts out on the street — was the point of the exercise. It helped create a frisson of fear, and reinforced the message of who was in control. It has also led to warnings from more traditional Republicans that Mr. Trump’s demand for loyalty over analysis is creating a trap for himself.</p><p>“Groupthink and a blinkered mind-set are dangers for any administration,” said Richard Fontaine, the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, which, in the days of bipartisanship, described itself as a bipartisan think tank. “Pulling from multiple sources in and outside of government to develop solid options for foreign policy decision makers is the way to go.”</p><p>Well, maybe in the Washington of a previous era.</p><p>Within a 200-yard radius of U.S.A.I.D., DOGE teams moved into the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank that had significant private funding and money from Congress. They shuttered it, from its Cold War archives to the Kennan Institute, one of the country’s leading collections of scholars about Russia. At a moment when superpower conflict is back, it was the kind of place that presented alternative views.</p><p>DOGE was unimpressed. Like their U.S.A.I.D. colleagues in another part of the Ronald Reagan Building, they were soon stuffing their notes into cartons and discovering their computer access had been shut down. (The Wilson Center also sponsored book writers, including some from The New York Times.)</p><p>The war on expertise has raised some fundamental questions that may not be answerable until after the Trump administration is over. Will the experts stick around — after hiding out in the private sector or changing professions — only to reoccupy the Swamp? And more immediately, what damage is being done in what may be the country’s defining challenge: the competition with China over artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons, electric vehicles, quantum computing?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>That is what many in the intelligence agencies worry about, not least because Europe is already openly recruiting disillusioned American scientists, and China’s intelligence services are looking for the angry and abandoned.</p><p>Graham Allison, the Harvard professor who writes often on the U.S.-China technological and military competitions, told an audience at the A.I. Summit on Wednesday that America is not acting like it understands that “China has emerged as a full-spectrum competitor.”</p><p>“Our secret sauce,” he said, has been the American ability to “recruit the most talented people in the world. Einstein didn’t come from America.” </p><p>“The idea that we would be taking action that would undermine that makes no sense to any strategic thinker,” he said. </p><p>Of course, those strategic thinkers rank among the suspect class of Washington experts.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David E.
