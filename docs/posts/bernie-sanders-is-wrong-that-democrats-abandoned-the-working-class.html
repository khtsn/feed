Look at the last two Democratic administrations.</p><p>Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, a law that <a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/kff-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&amp;aRange=twoYear" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most Americans favor</a>. He signed legislation ranging from the Dodd-Frank financial reform to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/business/economy/a-credit-card-rule-that-worked-for-consumers.html" title="">Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act</a>. Sanders voted for these. Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/opinion/general-motors-bailout.html" title="">bailed out</a> the auto industry. He did a bunch of stuff that didn’t specifically target working-class Americans, but that many working-class Americans presumably liked: repealing Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, tripling the number of women on the Supreme Court, signing the Fair Sentencing Act.</p><p>During Obama’s presidency, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unemployment rate</a> went from 7.8 percent to 4.7 percent. Black unemployment went from 12.7 percent to 7.5 percent, and Latino unemployment went from 10.1 percent to 5.8 percent. (All while the Dow Jones industrial average went up 149 percent, and lots of working-class and middle-class Americans have 401(k)s.)</p><p>President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act included the now-expired expanded child tax credit. His Inflation Reduction Act permits the government to negotiate prescription drug prices for Medicare recipients. He signed a bipartisan infrastructure law. Sanders voted for these.</p><p>During Biden’s tenure, the unemployment rate has gone from 6.4 percent to 4.1 percent. Black unemployment has gone from 9.3 percent to 5.7 percent, and Latino unemployment has gone from 8.5 percent to 5.1 percent. (While the Dow has increased 41 percent as of Tuesday’s close.)</p><p>Kamala Harris laid out a raft of <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">economic plans</a>, including those specifically focused on <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FMfcgzQXJZxzLGgcKmSNQSXCRKXShwxJ.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Black</a> and <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/adelante/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Latino</a> men. I think she wound up promising too much — if she had won, it would have been better to have under-promised and over-delivered. Democrats, in general, need to rely less on policy proposals to win presidential elections; in the weeks that followed her convincing debate win against Donald Trump, Harris needed to tell a more cohesive story about where she wanted to take the country in the next four years to counter the story that Trump was telling.</p><p>Sanders may not think Harris promised enough — but even if that’s the case, it’s hard to say she didn’t lay out a platform focused on working Americans.</p><p>Four years ago, making the case for a Sanders presidency, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/26/calm-down-establishment-democrats-bernie-sanders-might-be-safest-choice/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a>: “Today’s main divide isn’t left versus right. It’s establishment versus anti-establishment.” That’s fair. It’s also fair to argue, as Sanders does, that Democrats haven’t done enough to address wealth inequality and are too beholden to moneyed interests.</p><p>Four years from now, Democrats may nominate a candidate who favors a more social democratic platform — maybe Sanders. But as a response to an election with a binary choice, the notion that Democrats have “abandoned” the working class really isn’t backed up by the record.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FkZDNhNDUwLTM4MTAtNTIxMC04MTI5LTQ4ODQ1MTM4N2NlNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/opinion/thepoint#trump-immigration-appointments-miller" data-source-id="100000009820076"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-goldberg"><img alt="Michelle Goldberg" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/michelle-goldberg/michelle-goldberg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/michelle-goldberg/michelle-goldberg-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/michelle-goldberg/michelle-goldberg-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-12T10:07:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 12, 2024, 5:07 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stephen Miller</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Peterson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A strange thing about the presidential campaign we just endured is how many people rationalized their support for Donald Trump by arguing that he wouldn’t make good on some of his central promises.</p><p>“I think mass deportation is just talk, but the era of open borders will be over,” Scott McConnell, a co-founder of The American Conservative, <a href="https://x.com/ScottMcConnell9/status/1852329679803363644" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X. In July a Mexican-born Trump backer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-latino-voters-deportation.html" title="">told</a> The Times, “Last time, he didn’t even finish the wall. What’s he going to do this time?”</p><p>Now the answer is taking shape: He’s going to oversee a militarized mass roundup of the undocumented. On Sunday, Trump named Tom Homan, his former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as “border czar.” </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-nfyMCS9wo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech</a> to this year’s National Conservatism Conference, Homan, who oversaw Trump’s family separation policy, promised a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-immigration-plans-deportation-e91b1bc4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“historic deportation operation”</a> from which no undocumented immigrant would be safe. “No one’s off the table in the next administration,” he said. “If you’re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”</p><p>Then, on Monday, Trump named the obsessively anti-immigrant Stephen Miller as his deputy chief of staff. Miller’s portfolio, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html" title="">reported</a> in The Times, “is expected to be vast and to far exceed what the eventual title will convey.” Miller has been forthright about his desire to purge immigrants here illegally, as well as many here legally, from the United States.</p><p>Among other things, Miller has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">said</a> that Trump would cancel the temporary protected status of thousands of Afghans who fled here after the Taliban’s takeover and take another stab at ending DACA, the program that protects from deportation some immigrants brought to the United States as children.</p><p>Most significantly, he’s laid out plans to use National Guard troops to help arrest migrants en masse, warehousing them in military camps while they await deportation. No one should be shocked when this happens. I suspect some will be anyway.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMzZTc1ZTkyLThkMDctNWQ0Mi1iZDRiLWI2M2RmZjc4ZjUwZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/opinion/thepoint#democrats-free-fair-election" data-source-id="100000009817587"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-11T18:00:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 11, 2024, 1:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>It was not for lack of trying. Democrats left nothing on the field, stood for hours to get into rallies, donated a billion dollars, and knocked on a gazillion doors. It just wasn’t enough. At a time when so many people feel let down by the election, I had a few questions for </em><a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/ben-ansell" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Ben Ansell</em></a><em>, author of the 2023 book “</em><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/444113/why-politics-fails-by-ansell-ben/9780241992753" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Why Politics Fails</em></a><em>” and a professor of comparative democracy at Oxford University.</em></p><p><strong>Q: Did politics fail?</strong></p><p>A: Politics is at heart about how we resolve our inevitable disagreements, ideally agreeably. Clearly the American public have deep-rooted disagreements over abortion, the role of government, what’s good for the economy, and the relative importance of protecting democratic norms. But despite those disagreements and the often disagreeable tone of the campaign, the election itself was largely peaceful and decisive. Not everyone will like the outcome, but it is clear and unchaotic.</p><p><strong>Is democracy in danger? Or is this a sign that democracy is alive and well?</strong></p><p>I think it’s fair to say Donald Trump is no liberal democracy’s greatest advocate. He does not love the checks and balances of the media, of protest, or of courts. Nor do I expect him to be a strong promoter of democracy abroad, given his transactional style of diplomacy and his tendency to compliment authoritarian leaders. But he is also the beneficiary of a fair and free democratic process and is the legitimate winner. <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2021/ressa/facts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Ressa</a>, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, argued that 2024 might be the year democracy falls off a cliff, and yet we have made it to November without major backsliding in any democracy and with a clear result in the U.S., where many feared months of lawsuits, protests, denial and shenanigans.</p><p><strong>Should the losers of this election give their consent or not? Trump didn’t consent when he lost. Why should Democrats?</strong></p><p>One core problem of democracy I emphasize in “Why Political Fails” is that in highly polarized democracies, there is a problem of losers’ consent: Both that the losers may not admit they lost — a problem we will not have after this U.S. election — and that winners sometimes act as if they never need consent from the losers to rule. While winners can often ignore losers, crushing them ruthlessly can often store up more trouble for later, as we have seen in the United Kingdom after Brexit. Democrats will need to consent to having lost. There is no evidence of fraud. But they do not have to pretend to support the new president, and he in turn will have to take on the consequences of hammering the Democrats while they are down. That might or might not be successful. The 2026 midterms will let us know.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Q1YjYzMzhmLWNkMzgtNWNhMi1hNWRhLWQxYWRjZWU3ZGQyYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/opinion/thepoint#trump-civil-service-employees" data-source-id="100000009817084"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jyoti-thottam"><img alt="Jyoti Thottam" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/22/opinion/Jyoti_Thottam/Jyoti_Thottam-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/22/opinion/Jyoti_Thottam/Jyoti_Thottam-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/22/opinion/Jyoti_Thottam/Jyoti_Thottam-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-11T10:04:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 11, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Handing over the presidency from one administration to the next is a big task, with all kinds of procedures in place to make the transition run smoothly. The Trump transition team is not interested in any of those procedures. It has not participated in transition planning, security clearances or ethics reviews with the departing administration, even as it prepares to name about 4,000 people as political appointees to run various agencies and departments in the federal government. It’s very possible that new Trump officials will simply move in with their desk décor on Inauguration Day and not worry about it.</p><p>“This would be the worst form of malpractice,” Max Stier, the president and C.E.O. of the Partnership for Public Service, told me. This concept of a plan, to put a new executive branch into place without any vetting or training, expecting that each person is capable of walking in and flying the plane, is worrying for a few reasons.</p><p>For one, there is a real but small possibility of a disruptive event — like a cyberattack or terrorist attack — during the transition, already a moment of maximum vulnerability for the national security apparatus. Without a proper transition process, that risk grows.</p><p>But more important, this administration’s disregard for an orderly, procedural transition demonstrates a vision of an executive branch that serves the will of the president rather than the public.</p><p>At the end of his first term, Donald Trump issued an executive order creating a Schedule F category of federal employees, who would be political appointments rather than career civil service workers. If, as expected, Trump issues a similar order in January, the government could fire thousands of workers who would lose their civil service protections in crucial positions in national security, drug safety and public health. Trump then could fill those positions with those who are loyal to him and him alone.</p><p>Stier is particularly worried about lesser-known agencies like the White House Office of Management and Budget, which he described as “the nerve center of our government.” In the first Trump administration, career civil servants in that office gave honest assessments of the effects that various Trump policies would have and of whether they were legal. Once those people are replaced with loyalists, there is a substantial risk that this sort of expertise disappears.</p><p>“This is a train wreck you can see coming,” Stier said.</p><p>Congress could, of course, block Trump from doing this. What’s more likely to happen is a protracted period of legal challenges from individuals and government employee unions while many of the best people in government simply leave for the private sector. That would compound the tragedy.</p><p>Americans need people who are already in government and can speak up about bad policies to use the power that they have. Soon there may be a lot fewer of them.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE1MjlhOWY5LTE5NGItNWFhNC1hODU3LWU4MWJhY2FhOWUyNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/opinion/thepoint#4b-movement-south-korea-trump" data-source-id="100000009816310"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kami-rieck"><img alt="Kami Rieck" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-10T06:00:08.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 10, 2024, 1:00 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>No dating men, no sex with men, no heterosexual marriage and no childbirth. These are the four principles of South Korea’s 4B movement, a radical feminist movement that gained popularity in 2019, in response to sexism, hidden camera pornography and intimate partner violence. After Donald Trump’s victory, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/style/4b-movement.html" title="">some American women</a> have sought out the movement. But it would be a mistake for women in the United States to adopt its principles, which risk alienating those who would be our allies while ensuring little actually changes about our reality.</p><p>Some American women are already devising plans to apply <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dreaaferr/video/7434389619480841502?_r=1&amp;_t=8rCZk24BM4o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used menstrual pads to trucks with MAGA stickers</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFTcPDge/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">undergo voluntary hysterectomy surgery</a>. TikTok and Instagram reels videos related to the 4B movement gained millions of views this week, and Google searches <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&amp;geo=US&amp;q=4b&amp;hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spiked in the U.S. on Wednesday</a>, most notably in Democratic states.</p><p>Trump’s win was devastating for many women. Their rage is understandable, but a 4B-style reaction is not constructive or sustainable. Women shouldn’t reduce their ability to demand policy changes and equal dignity to the ways in which we should or should not have sex or bear children. The 4B philosophy is shortsighted, primarily because it demonizes men, including those who champion equality and reproductive freedom, while constraining the women who participate in it.</p><p>Women have tried to use <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/01/17/510284069/kenyan-politician-proposes-women-withhold-sex-until-men-register-to-vote" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sex strikes for political influence</a> in Liberia, Kenya, Colombia, the Philippines, Belgium and other countries. Aside from gaining publicity, there is little <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/04/do-sex-strikes-ever-work-we-ask-an-expert#:~:text=Many%20in%20the%20west%20heard,women%20have%20less%20economic%20autonomy." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evidence</a> to suggest that they successfully persuade people. The activist Leymah Gbowee, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 for leading a women’s protest movement credited for ending the second Liberian civil war, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/01/17/510284069/kenyan-politician-proposes-women-withhold-sex-until-men-register-to-vote" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in her memoir</a> that sex strikes “had little or no practical effect.”</p><p>Trump’s election should spur American feminists to address gendered grievances in ways that could be more materially effective. In developed countries, women wield significant economic and purchasing power, control a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/03/07/who-runs-the-world-women-control-85-of-purchases-29-of-stem-roles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">majority of global consumer spending</a> and make up a substantial portion of the work force. In response to rising gender inequality, women should harness their political and economic power to demand change rather than limit ourselves to our sexual power. We would be best served by rejecting unequal household duties, engaging in a consumer strike or boycotting discriminatory companies.</p><p>Women also must take this opportunity to bring men along with us. Changing gender roles is a main reason many young men <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/upshot/trump-polls-young-men.html" title="">say they feel</a> economically and socially left behind. Instead of boycotting men, feminists should acknowledge the legitimate ways men have lost ground in education, employment and health and find ways to craft a feminist message that includes them in the project of ensuring equal rights for us all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Q2OWI2NDdjLWMyZDctNWMxYy1hNjM3LWEyZDdmYTE4YWM5YQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/opinion/thepoint#congestion-pricing-hochul-trump" data-source-id="100000009817575"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-gay"><img alt="Mara Gay" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-09T20:34:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 9, 2024, 3:34 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In a terrible moment for American democracy, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York has a short window to do at least one good thing­­: enact a congestion pricing plan for New York City before Donald Trump takes office­­.</p><p>Hochul foolishly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/opinion/gov-hochuls-unwarranted-retreat-on-congestion-pricing.html" title="">scrapped</a> the plan in June, days before it was set to be implemented. It’s great that she is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/nyregion/trump-congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">seriously considering</a> reviving the program, since congestion pricing is the best — and probably the only — way to get the subway system the funding it badly needs and reduce traffic and pollution in the Manhattan core.</p><p>Hochul is reportedly exploring whether it’s possible to quickly implement the plan with a lower toll for drivers, $9 instead of $15, before Trump can act on <a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/08/26/trump-hochul-kill-congestion-pricing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his promise to kill it</a>. That suggests the governor understands the urgency with which Democratic leaders need to act to show that they can deliver on their promises and still know how to govern.</p><p>If they hope to continue to win elections, New York Democrats will have to begin the painful work of understanding why so many voters — especially Asians and Latinos — rejected their party last week and supported Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/trump-nyc-voters.html" title="">in greater numbers</a> than in 2020.</p><p>After an electoral shellacking, it may seem counterintuitive to move forward with congestion pricing, which is unpopular with many drivers, particularly in suburban areas. But in New York, the anger at Democrats isn’t confined to the 30 percent of the city’s voters who cast ballots for Trump. Many residents across the political spectrum, including progressives, are dissatisfied with New York’s machine-party-dominated, uninspiring, do-nothing politics. Enacting a good policy that will improve life long-term in the region is exactly the right response.</p><p>Very little of the focus on the city’s shift away from Democrats so far has talked about what life in New York City has actually been like over the four years. And it has been brutal. The city was devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic fallout that accompanied it. The virus has <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-totals.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed nearly 47,000 people</a> in the city.</p><p>It took New York City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/nyregion/nyc-covid-job-losses.html" title="">much longer</a> than the rest of the country to recover the jobs it lost. Crime is down from its height during the pandemic, but still higher than it was a decade ago. Housing prices continue to spiral out of control and the Democrats who enjoy total control over state government here have failed to build more housing.</p><p>More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nyc-migrant-crisis-explained.html" title="">210,000 migrants</a> have arrived in the city, stretching its resources and tragically becoming a source of resentment. Mayor Eric Adams first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/nyregion/docgo-lander-audit-contract.html" title="">mismanaged</a> the crisis, then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/nyregion/adams-migrants-destroy-nyc.html" title="">added his voice</a> to Republicans stoking anti-immigrant sentiment. Adams has done little to improve life in New York and earlier this year was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html" title="">indicted</a> on federal criminal charges of corruption and bribery.</p><p>Trump, a fake populist doing the bidding of his billionaire friends, is very unlikely to solve any of these problems, and is almost certain to cause more pain. He has expressed open disdain and often hatred of many of the Americans who live in New York City.</p><p>Knowing that 30 percent of our neighbors voted for him anyway, or possibly because of this, is a political crisis for Democrats. It has also broken my heart.</p><p>In the years ahead, New York’s Democratic leaders will be called upon to protect millions of Americans and our basic freedoms. They will also have to have find a way to start solving problems in the nation’s largest city.</p><p>Enacting congestion pricing is a good start. Hochul should move to implement it as quickly as possible.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzZkNjI1MDAxLTNlMDUtNWI2OC05NzE5LTkzYjcyMDgwOGZiNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/opinion/thepoint#johnson-house-speaker-trump" data-source-id="100000009817024"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-09T12:00:51.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 9, 2024, 7:00 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>It’s a good thing Mike Johnson is a praying man, because the House speaker is getting ready to go through a stretch that seems likely to try his soul.</p><p>Even as the counting in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/results-house-races-tracker.html" title="">a smattering of House races</a> drags on — mostly because California takes an eternity to tally its votes — the Republicans appear on track to retain their grip on the lower chamber. This isn’t surprising. It is the rare election cycle in which the party that captures the White House doesn’t also wind up controlling both chambers of Congress.</p><p>The stellar Republican performance at the polls should help Johnson in his quest to stay atop the conference. I mean, he’s a solid Trump guy. Why waste time trying to find a leader with marginally more aggressive bootlicking skills when there are so many other issues to start bickering over?</p><p>As the Republicans have so vividly displayed in recent years, a slender House majority can be a nightmare to manage — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/03/us/politics/mccarthy-house-speaker-vote-live.html" title="">poor Kev</a> — and Johnson could easily wind up with <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/inside-congress/2024/11/08/the-house-gops-margin-call-00188545?nname=inside-congress&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b4be0000&amp;nrid=00000163-9937-d365-aff3-fdbffcd70000&amp;nlid=630309" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another wafer-thin margin</a>. With a Republican conference like this one, well, things have a tendency to fall apart. The center cannot hold, because there is no meaningful center: just Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert scrapping in the women’s room while Jim Jordan barks threats at the Justice Department and a sprinkling of suburban moderates struggles to avoid the flaming vortex of chaos.</p><p>The big difference this term, of course, will be that — as Tucker Carlson <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tucker-carlson-donald-trump-daddy-spanking-rcna177097" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">so vomitously put it</a> — Daddy will be home. And who knows? Maybe the return of the MAGA king to the White House will be enough to transform his congressional team from a squabbling, dysfunctional freak show into a docile, well-oiled legislative machine. Johnson might not need to be a skilled leader so much as a Trumpian puppet.</p><p>That said, if the red team winds up fully in charge, the pressure to deliver on its new president’s Bold Promises will be enormous. And unrelenting. The Republican-led Senate will face calls to blow up the legislative filibuster to smooth the way for a MAGA agenda. All while Republican House leaders will be expected to ram through whatever tickles Trump’s fancy on a given day, no matter how difficult or dubious. And I think we all know how crabby this president-elect gets when he doesn’t get his way.</p><p>Johnson presumably believes he is ready for what lies ahead. But intellectually knowing the sort of sacrifices and debasement routinely demanded by a President Trump is one thing. Surviving the storm with a shred of one’s dignity or morality intact takes a minor miracle.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
