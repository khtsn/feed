		<p>The groups for VCT Pacific have been rearranged ahead of Stage 2. Three pairs of teams from Group Alpha and Group Omega switched sides, mixing up the outlook for league play to end the regional season. Unlike in 2024, group stage results for each stage are now independent from one another, meaning teams get a clean slate in their hopes of qualifying for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions 2025</a> through Stage 2.</p>

<p>The groups are as follows:</p>









<p>For the draw, teams were placed into three different pools, with the first and second seed teams in the first pool, the third and fourth seed teams in the second pool, and the fifth and sixth seed teams in the third pool. One pairing was selected from each pool, which designated which pair switched groups. The first seed was picked from the first pool, meaning BOOM Esports and Rex Regum Qeon switch groups. The fourth seed was picked from the second pool, meaning Paper Rex and Nongshim RedForce switch groups. Finally, the sixth seed was picked from the third pool, meaning DetonatioN FocusMe and Team Secret switch.</p>

<p>Seedings for the draw were based purely on group stage results, and the newly mixed groups make for some eye-catching matchups. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/champions-tour-2025-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> grand finalists RRQ and Gen.G will go head to head in Group Alpha, which  has three of the top-four finishing teams from the playoffs. The group also includes three of the region&#39;s four Korean teams. Meanwhile, Group Omega will see the region&#39;s two Japanese squads go head to head, while BOOM, TALON, and PRX look to clash as some of the region&#39;s finest Southeast Asian squads.</p>

<p>Stage 2 is set to begin in July, with the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/434033/pacific-stage-2-grand-finals-weekend-to-take-place-in-tokyo" target="_blank">grand finals weekend</a> of the playoffs to take place in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
