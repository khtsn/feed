He was identified as a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian citizen who first came to Germany in 2006 and worked as a doctor in a small town 25 miles south of Magdeburg, officials said.</p><p>Saudi Arabia condemned the attack in a <a href="https://x.com/KSAmofaEN/status/1870270698763002144" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement by its Foreign Ministry</a> that did not mention the suspect. “The Kingdom expresses its solidarity with the German people and the families of the victims,” the statement said.</p><p>More than 65 people were injured, 14 of them severely, said Michael Reif, the spokesman for Magdeburg. The authorities say they believe it was a deliberate attack. They are working to determine a motive, said Reiner Haseloff, the governor of Saxony-Anhalt state, where Magdeburg is the capital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Every human life lost in this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many,” a visibly shaken Mr. Haseloff told reporters on Friday night.</p></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
