    <h1>The U.S. Agreed to Resume Military Aid to Ukraine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Trump administration agreed today to immediately lift its pause on intelligence sharing and military assistance for Ukraine. The announcement followed a meeting in Saudi Arabia during which Ukrainian officials said they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-us-saudi-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">support a U.S. proposal for a 30-day cease-fire with Russia</a>.</p><p>The Kremlin did not immediately comment, and there is no indication that they would support such a truce. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the American delegation, said that Ukraine’s support for a cease-fire now puts pressure on Russia to end the war.</p><p>“The ball is now in their court,” Rubio said. President Trump told reporters that he thought he would speak this week with Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Neither the Americans nor Ukrainians suggested that their initial agreement included any of the security guarantees that Kyiv had long insisted upon. But the U.S. national security adviser said that today’s discussions included “what type of guarantees they’re going to have for their long term security and prosperity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Trump had suspended all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after a confrontational White House meeting with Ukraine’s president late last month.
