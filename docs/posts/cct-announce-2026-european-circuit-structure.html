                  <p>CCT have announced their circuit structure for 2026, featuring a progression system that gives a chance to up-and-coming teams for a shot at the CCT Europe trophy.</p>
                  <p>The tournament organizer will hold a total of 34 across three circuits, namely the Regular CCT Europe, Challengers Europe, and Contenders Europe.</p>
                  <p>The lowest circuit in the food chain, Contenders, will feature a 16-strong team list which will come entirely from two open qualifiers for the first four events, and feature a $2,500 prize pool alongside two spots in the next Challengers event.</p>
                  <p>From Series 5-10, two open qualifier teams will join 14 VRS invited squads.</p>
                  <p>Each Challengers event will award $5,000 and two spots at the CCT Europe circuit, with all teams set to receive their invites either through the VRS ranking or qualifying through the Contenders circuit.</p>
                  <p>The main CCT Europe circuit remains largely unchanged, with each of the 16 iterations across the year featuring a $25,000 prize pool, with a total of 36 invites spread across the Play-In, group stage, and playoffs.</p>
                  <p>For more information about the circuits, you can read CCT&#39;s road map <a href="https://cctour.gg/cct-2026-events/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
