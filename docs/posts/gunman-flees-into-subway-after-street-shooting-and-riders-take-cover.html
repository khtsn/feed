The victim, who is 47, was struck in the leg and shoulder and was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was in stable condition.</p><p>The victim and the shooter knew each other, according to a law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the matter. The gunman previously worked with the victim at a computer sales and repair shop on 68th Street, Lincoln Business Machines, according to the official, and on Thursday morning, the two men got into an argument there. The victim then fled the business and the gunman chased him outside.</p><p>After the shooting, the gunman ran into the 72nd Street subway station. The police then shut down the electrical power to the station in order to search for him, ensuring that no one would be struck by a moving train or electrocuted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police said they did not have anyone in custody and that the shooting was still under investigation.</p><p>The shooting was a manifestation of some of New Yorkers’ fears and frustrations about safety on the city’s subterranean transit system. As the police searched for the gunman, riders throughout the trains were told to get down and shelter in place without being fully aware of what was happening around them. Some New Yorkers reported being stuck on trains for more than an hour.</p><p>C train service was suspended in both directions after the shooting, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, before resuming with delays, and there were other delays reported throughout the system.</p><p>A New York Times reporter was on a southbound C train that was stopped between 81st and 72nd Streets. The train’s conductor told riders to get on the floor and keep their heads down.</p><p>The conductor announced around 9:50 a.m. that there was a police investigation at the 72nd Street station, which serves the B and C train lines. Within minutes, two officers boarded the first car of the train as they searched for the gunman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As passengers lay on the floor, police officers walked along the tracks outside, at times shining their flashlights into the car. At one point, the conductor tried to reassure the riders, telling them that the gunman was not near their train car.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Police officers stand on the stairs in a subway station talking to other people." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07ny-train-03-lvbq/07ny-train-03-lvbq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f1760804-89f1-5319-b968-e1fccd934d4b" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers at the 72nd Street station after the shooting.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hurubie Meko/ The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Around 10:10 a.m., the police — in special operations gear — began evacuating the C train, as well as other nearby trains, and leading riders onto the tracks. The passengers, several of whom were distraught and crying, were then led onto the platform at the 72nd Street station and taken above ground.</p><p>Police and Fire Department officials taped off the station after the passengers had been evacuated.</p><p>In the aftermath of the shooting, pedestrians on Columbus Avenue appeared shaken. Some began to cry and make phone calls, as the sirens of emergency vehicles could be heard coming down the avenue. Near the corner of 69th Street, a large group huddled near a bike lane, where the victim could be seen on the ground. He appeared alert and was being tended to.</p><p>Crime rates in New York City, including throughout the transit system, rose during the coronavirus pandemic, but subway crime has been on the decline recently. There were 168 major crimes committed in the subway system last month, 26 percent fewer than in October 2023, the police said. And through October of this year, the number of major crimes dropped 6 percent compared with the same period last year, the police said, citing statistics released on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Still, subway safety remains a top concern for riders.</p><p>In February, New York City Transit workers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/nyregion/subway-slashing-mta-protest.html" title="">stopped performing their duties</a> during the morning commute after a slashing attack on an A train left a conductor injured. A week later, Gov. Kathy Hochul <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/nyregion/subway-national-guard-police.html" title="">sent hundreds of state troopers and National Guard members</a> into the city’s subways to patrol the system and check bags.</p><p>Near where the shooting happened on Thursday, shattered glass from a bus-shelter windowpane covered a stretch of sidewalk on the west side of Columbus Avenue near 69th Street.</p><p>Across the street, a Joe Coffee shop had been open for a couple of uneventful hours when the three baristas on duty heard what they said was about a half-dozen gunshots.</p><p>“It was terrifying,” one of the three, Arielle Schmid, said.</p><p>Eight to 10 people, the workers said, came running into the shop and hid behind the counter and in the bathroom, where the baristas also took shelter.</p><p>One person called 911, and several minutes later, those hiding behind the counter said it was safe to come out.</p><p>Around the corner, on 68th Street, several police officers and detectives were gathered outside the basement-level entrance to Lincoln Business Machines.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Patrick Farrell<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ed Shanahan<!-- -->, <!-- -->Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> and <!-- -->Anna Venarchik<!-- -->. <!-- -->Susan C.
