The man, whom the authorities identified as Matthew Ronald Teeple, of Cleveland, N.C., was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said.</p><p>On Saturday, three people were killed and several others were injured when the same storm system spawned a tornado in southeastern Texas and severe storms in Mississippi, the authorities said.</p><p>A tornado touched down multiple times early Saturday afternoon in Brazoria County, Texas, about 30 miles south of Houston, said Madison Polston, a spokeswoman for the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office. More than a dozen homes, several businesses and an elementary school were damaged, she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The body of a 48-year-old woman was found about 100 feet from her home in Liverpool, Texas, on Saturday. Preliminary reports indicated that her death was related to the storm, Ms. Madison said.</p><p>The injured were all in noncritical condition on Sunday and no additional injuries were expected.</p><p>“We rarely get tornadoes here in Brazoria County,” Ms. Polston said on Saturday. “If we do, for there to be damage to this extent, or injuries, is also very uncommon.”</p><p>Later on Saturday, two people were killed and several others were injured in severe weather in Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves <a href="https://x.com/tatereeves/status/1873430128837169499" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>. One of the deaths occurred in Adams County, and the other in Lowndes County. Six weather-related injuries were reported in Franklin, Simpson and Wayne Counties, he said.</p><p>Preliminary reports show that there were at least five tornadoes in Mississippi on Saturday, and teams were surveying damaged areas to investigate, according to Logan Poole, a meteorologist in the Weather Center’s Jackson office.</p><p>“That number is almost certain to grow,” he said.</p><p>In Texas, there were reports of heavy structural damage from a possible tornado in Montgomery County, north of Houston, according to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mctx.oem/posts/pfbid0X5a5EFDxdAxd5Z2xv2PSXo9RyiifcTieNHfcqLz5ajUU9368JwwqtQjiKH1k95CNl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Montgomery County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management</a>. Damage from a possible tornado at the East County Fire Department in Montgomery County resulted in minor injuries, according to the service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Storms producing tornadoes are rarely seen in the Southeast this time of year, Christopher Rainer, a meteorologist with the Weather Center in Jackson, Miss., said on Sunday.</p><p>“We don’t get many of these type of outbreaks, at least here in the Southeast, at least not around the month of December,” he said.</p><p>Alexandra E.
