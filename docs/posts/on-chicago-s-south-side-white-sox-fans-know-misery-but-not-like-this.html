On Sunday, the team lost for the 120th time this year, tying the major league record for most losses by a modern-day team in a single season. </p><p>The loss happened nearly 2,000 miles away in San Diego, where the Padres beat the Sox, 4-2. </p><p>But it landed like one more gut punch on the South Side of Chicago in Bridgeport, the neighborhood where the White Sox have played for more than a century, and home to many families who have loyally cheered for the team for generations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>All Sunday afternoon, customers drifted in and out of BallPark, about as Sox-centric as a bar can be. The walls are covered with Sox memorabilia: a mural depicting the notorious Disco Demolition Night at Comiskey Park in 1979 that ended in a riot, a black-and-white portrait of the former maverick team owner Bill Veeck, a yellow vintage sign advertising $3 grandstand seats. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Patrons at BallPark Pub, near where the Chicago White Sox play their home games, watched the Chicago Bears and other N.F.L. teams play on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Welcome Sox Fans!” a large sign by the door beckons. </p><p>These days, few fans who walk through the door of BallPark are here to watch the Sox. </p><p>“It’s just painful,” said Rania Al-Najjar, 29, a nurse, who said she was finished following games for the season.</p><p>The team has struggled through some mediocre years, but 2024 has been a demoralizing march to the bottom, landing them in a tie with the 1962 Mets’ record of 120 losses. After Sunday, the Sox still have six games left to play. Few envision that this team will avoid a record-breaking defeat. </p><p>“We expect to lose,” said Jacob Swartley, a lifelong fan and Bridgeport resident.</p><p>They are used to feeling like the underdog. Sox fans — proudly centered on the South Side of Chicago — often seem to fall in the shadow of the Cubs, whose celebrated ballpark, Wrigley Field, is on the North Side. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>You have to be from the South Side to understand, said Joan Colby, 82, who nursed a Bud Light. And it’s not only about baseball. She remembers growing up in the area and seeing families who abandoned the neighborhood — and the Sox.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joan Colby, a lifelong White Sox fan from the South Side, has tried to tune out news of the team’s loses this season.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“People who had money moved to the North Side and became Cubs fans,” she said. </p><p>This year, Ms. Colby said, she tries not to listen to news of the Sox’s interminable losses. She was thinking more about her memories: walking to games with her parents and siblings when she was a little girl — more than a mile each way — and, on days when they couldn’t get to the park, listening to the games on the radio. </p><p>After the team won the World Series in 2005, Ms. Colby ducked out of work to watch the parade. </p><p>“I’m not really going to be able to ditch the Sox, ever,” she said. </p><p>Paul Gadalinski, 50, came to BallPark wearing a Bears hat and Bears jersey. Asked about the Sox, he let out a mangled shriek.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“I live on the South Side. I was born to be a Sox fan,” Mr. Gadalinski said. “But I don’t want to watch them lose and have the worst record in the history of baseball.” </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Chicago White Sox warming up between innings in California on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Liv Paggiarino for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Eaves, the bartender, grew up in Bridgeport — “my whole family are Sox fans, I’m a Sox fan”— but skipped the games this year. She last went to a game in person in 2023 on opening day, which is practically a holiday in Bridgeport.</p><p>For months now, there’s been little to cheer. “People are just like, whatever, the year’s over,” she said. “There’s always hope for next year.” </p><p>Some fans said they had given up on the team for good.<span>  </span></p><p>Mark Aguilar, a resident of Bridgeport for 27 years, sat at the bar with a cheeseburger and a Coors Light. He nodded toward his cellphone, propped up on the bar with a video playing. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“I’m just here to watch my fantasy football team,” he said, ignoring the Sox game on a screen overhead.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prelander Berroa, a White Sox pitcher,  watched the game from the dugout.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Liv Paggiarino for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Aguilar had declared himself finished with the Sox in 2023. He said he blames Jerry Reinsdorf, the 88-year-old owner of the team, who, Mr. Aguilar said, kept hiring incompetent managers, people who didn’t even seem to want to be there. Penny-pinching, he said, was running the team into the ground. </p><p>“It’s like he only buys players if he has a Groupon,”Mr. Aguilar said. </p><p>As the final score of 4-2 flashed on the screen, Russell Mustari, who has lived across the street from the team’s ballpark for close to 50 years, slapped his hand to his forehead.</p><p>“It’s over now,” Mr. Mustari said, as the rainy drizzle that had been falling outside all day echoed his gloom. He had a fresh regret: that the Sox were not at home with their fans, however few, when they tied the record on Sunday. </p><p>“I wish they had lost this game in their own ballpark,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times, writing and reporting stories from around the Midwest.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/chicago-white-sox">Chicago White Sox</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/new-york-mets">New York Mets</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Bulletproofing America’s Classrooms: </strong>Ballistic armor companies are marketing protective products designed for the military to parents and schools. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/18/science/bulletproofing-schools.html">Some people see the items as unsettling but prudent; others find them infuriating</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Sting of Trump’s Threats</strong><strong>: </strong>Haitian Americans across the United States charged Donald Trump and JD Vance, who spread baseless rumors that Haitians in an Ohio city were eating pets, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/haitian-americans-springfield-ohio-reaction.html">imperiling their community for political gain</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Religion in Public Schools: </strong>As the idea of incorporating the Bible into classrooms gains traction, concerns about the mission of public schools have led <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/christians-bibles-public-schools-oklahoma-texas.html">even some conservative Christians to push back</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Man vs. Trees: </strong>Utah footed a big bill when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/utah-forestry-contracts.html">the owner of a hunting retreat knocked down trees on his and nearby properties</a>.
