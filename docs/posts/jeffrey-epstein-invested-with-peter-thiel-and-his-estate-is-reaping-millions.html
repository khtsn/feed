Today that investment is worth nearly $170 million, according to a confidential financial analysis of the late Mr. Epstein’s estate reviewed by The New York Times and a statement provided by a Valar spokesman.</p><p>The investment in Valar, which specializes in providing start-up capital to financial services tech companies, is the largest asset still held by Mr. Epstein’s estate, some six years after he died by suicide in federal custody while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.</p><p>Mr. Epstein’s investment with Mr. Thiel’s firm has not been previously reported or publicly disclosed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There’s a good chance much of the windfall will not go to any of the roughly 200 victims whom the disgraced financier abused when they were teenagers or young women. Those victims have already received monetary settlements from the estate, which required them to sign broad releases that gave up the right to bring future claims against it or individuals associated with it.</p><p>The money is more likely to be distributed to one of Mr. Epstein’s former girlfriends and two of his long-term advisers, who have been named the beneficiaries of his estate.</p><p>That outcome doesn’t sit well with one of the lawyers who fought for years to help the women receive restitution. David Boies, who represented several of Mr. Epstein’s victims<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-lawsuits-victims.html" title="">,</a> said federal authorities seemed to lose interest after Mr. Epstein’s death and the successful conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell, his former companion, on sex-trafficking charges.</p><p>He said prosecutors in New York had made a mistake in not going for civil forfeiture after Mr. Epstein killed himself, which would have allowed the federal government to potentially seize the remaining assets.</p><p>“While we are grateful for the government’s prosecution of Epstein and Maxwell, the truth is that, both before and afterwards, the government was largely asleep at the switch,” Mr. Boies said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Civil forfeiture allows the government to seize assets suspected of being involved in an illegal action. In theory, some of the seized assets could have been used to compensate victims.</p><p>After Mr. Epstein’s death, federal prosecutors had considered bringing a civil forfeiture action against his estate. But authorities rejected the idea because the process might have delayed settlement payments to victims, said a person who was briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Conspiracy theories  continue to swirl about the circumstances of Jeffrey Epstein’s death in jail.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">New York State Sex Offender Registry/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A college dropout, Mr. Epstein amassed much of his wealth by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/business/jeffrey-epstein-leon-black-apollo.html" title="">charging hefty fees for providing tax and estate</a> services to a few billionaires like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/business/jeffrey-epstein-finances.html" title="">Leslie Wexner,</a> the retail magnate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/business/jeffrey-epstein-leon-black-art-deal.html" title="">and Leon Black,</a> the private equity investor. Mr. Black, for instance, paid Mr. Epstein more than $158 million in fees and Mr. Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan once belonged to Mr. Wexner.</p><p>Mr. Thiel, whose meetings with Mr. Epstein were first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/business/jeffrey-epstein-peter-thiel.html" title="">reported</a> by The Times two years ago, is just one more in a long list of famous and wealthy men who met with Mr. Epstein over the years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Aaron Curtis, a Valar spokesman, said in statement that when a firm representative met with Mr. Epstein in 2014, he was considered a “well-known adviser to world leaders, top universities and philanthropic organizations.”</p><p>He said the firm, which was co-founded by Mr. Thiel and is led by Andrew McCormack and James Fitzgerald, “hopes that the eventual distribution of these investments can be put to positive use by helping victims move forward with their lives.”</p><p>Jeremiah Hall, a spokesman for Mr. Thiel, declined to comment.</p><p>Through a representative, the co-executors of Mr. Epstein’s estate declined to comment.</p><p>At the moment, the estate’s investment with Valar remains locked up, meaning it cannot be paid out in cash. Investments with venture capital firms are normally subject to long periods of lockup to give the companies that are being funded time to grow.</p><p>Based on the estimated value of the Valar investment, Mr. Epstein’s estate is worth more than $200 million in all, according the confidential report and estate records. When he died, Mr. Epstein had about $600 million in assets, which included investments, his lavish homes, artwork and jewelry. Over the past six years, the estate has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements to victims and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/business/jeffrey-epstein-settlement-virgin-islands.html" title="">U.S. Virgin Islands,</a> where Mr. Epstein maintained a residence. The estate also has had to pay federal taxes and hefty fees to lawyers working for the estate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Years after his death, Mr. Epstein’s story, especially the circumstances of his passing, has remained fodder for conspiracy theorists.</p><p>Mr. Thiel himself has discussed the importance of the federal government’s airing facts surrounding certain conspiracy theories, including those involving Mr. Epstein. In an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a46cb128-1f74-4621-ab0b-242a76583105" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion piece</a> he wrote in January for the Financial Times, Mr. Thiel said the conspiracy theory surrounding Mr. Epstein’s death was one of many that might be dealt with during the Trump administration.</p><p>F.B.I. Director Kash Patel <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/dan-bongino-kash-patel-jeffrey-epstein-rcna209871" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently reaffirmed</a> the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s determination in 2019 that Mr. Epstein died by suicide.</p><p>There remains just one major pending federal civil lawsuit against the executors of the estate, a potential class action filed on behalf victims who haven’t yet settled with the estate. The lawsuit was brought by Mr. Boies’ firm but it’s not known how many women would even quality for a settlement.</p><p>In the past, victims have received settlements ranging from $500,000 to $2 million.</p><p>Once that lawsuit is resolved, the estate will be close to begin distributing money according to terms of the will Mr. Epstein signed shortly before he died. The will calls for the assets remaining in his estate to be distributed according to a secret trust he set up called the 1953 Trust, which was named for the year he was born.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Estate law normally does not give executors much latitude to deviate from how a person wanted their assets distributed.</p><p>The only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/jeffrey-epstein-estate-tax-refund.html" title="">known beneficiaries of the trust</a> are a former girlfriend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/business/jeffrey-epstein-estate.html" title="">Karyna Shuliak,</a> and the co-executors of the estate, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, both of whom were longtime advisers to Mr. Epstein. The trust, known as the 1953 Trust, has never been made public. Ms. Shuliak’s lawyer declined to comment.</p><p>According to a confidential financial document describing some details of the 1953 Trust, it was also Mr. Epstein’s intent for some $19 million in loans he had made to be forgiven, including some loans to entities that Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn are “closely associated” with. The confidential document, which was reviewed by The Times, was prepared by a special master working for the judge overseeing the probate of Mr. Epstein’s will in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was publicly filed on the court docket before it was later sealed.</p><p>At one point, one of the executors had predicted the estate would be worth less than $40 million after claims were paid.</p><p>But the estate’s assets began to swell last fall, after it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/jeffrey-epstein-estate-tax-refund.html" title="">received a large $111.6 million tax refund</a> from the Internal Revenue Service. Some of that money has since gone to pay off a loan and legal fees.</p><p>In its most recent public court filing, the estate, as of March 31, listed its total assets at a little over $131 million, of which about $50 million is cash. But that document notes it still records investments, such as the Valar investment, at their value when Mr. Epstein died nearly six years ago.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Goldstein is a Times reporter who covers Wall Street and white-collar crime and housing issues.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
