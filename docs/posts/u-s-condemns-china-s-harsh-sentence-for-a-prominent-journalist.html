Mr. Dong, 62, a former <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/dong-yuyu-nf-07-unjustly-sentenced-to-seven-years-in-prison-in-china/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harvard Nieman fellow</a>, has been held since February 2022, when officers from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/us/politics/china-cia-spy-mss.html" title="">Ministry of State Security</a>, China’s main intelligence agency, detained him and a Japanese diplomat while they ate lunch in a restaurant.</p><p>The officers released the diplomat after an interrogation, but prosecutors put Mr. Dong on trial behind closed doors in July 2023. He is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/world/asia/china-journalist-dong-yuyu.html" title="">the most prominent journalist imprisoned</a> in mainland China.</p><p>Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, said in a <a href="https://www.state.gov/unjust-sentencing-of-prc-journalist-dong-yuyu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Friday that Mr. Dong’s “arrest and today’s sentencing highlight the P.R.C.’s failure to live up to its commitments under international law and its own constitutional guarantees to all its citizens.” He used the initials of the formal name of the country, the People’s Republic of China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We celebrate Dong’s work as a veteran journalist and editor, as well as his contributions to U.S.-P.R.C. people-to-people ties, including as a Harvard University Nieman fellow,” Mr. Miller added. “We stand by Dong and his family and call for his immediate and unconditional release.”</p><p>R. Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China and a <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/public-leadership-management/rise-enormous-challenges-you-ambassador" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former Harvard professor</a>, also issued a <a href="https://x.com/USAmbChina/status/1862429417126936777" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> of condemnation, calling the sentencing “unjust.”</p><p>Mr. Dong’s case could become a bigger flashpoint under the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has vowed to take a confrontational approach to China. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/trump-cabinet-china-policy.html" title="">Senator Marco Rubio</a>, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of state, has crafted legislation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/us/politics/china-uyghurs-forced-labor.html" title="">that would punish China</a> for its human rights abuses. Mr. Rubio is a former co-chair of the <a href="https://www.cecc.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Congressional-Executive Commission on China</a>, which lists Mr. Dong as a prisoner “of priority concern” and urges action on his case by the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court, where Mr. Dong received his verdict after being detained on espionage charges.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Florence Lo/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Dong was a longtime editor and writer for Guangming Daily, the Communist Party’s leading newspaper for intellectual ideas, but he was not a party member.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Soon after starting at the newspaper, he took part in the 1989 pro-democracy protests, which ended with the military’s killing of hundreds or even thousands of civilians, and was sentenced to a year of hard labor in a steel factory. He returned to his job afterward, and through the decades wrote articles and columns on the need for China to embrace more liberal ideas and be more open to the outside world.</p><p>He spent 2006 to 2007 at Harvard as a Nieman fellow, a prestigious appointment for American and international journalists. He later did a fellowship and a visiting professorship in Japan, and also occasionally wrote essays for foreign publications, including the Chinese edition of The New York Times. (I first met Mr. Dong and his family on a visit to Harvard and kept in touch with them after I was posted to Beijing for The Times in 2008. I did a <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/class-of-2018/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nieman fellowship</a> later, and mentioned Mr. Dong’s case in my new <a href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/books/at-the-edge-of-empire-review-leaving-maos-china-6412c401" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book</a> on China.)</p><p>Mr. Dong’s harsh sentence comes at time of contradictions in the policies of the autocratic Xi Jinping, China’s leader. On the one hand, he has been trying to keep U.S.-China diplomacy stable and is encouraging some foreigners to live and work in China to boost its slowing economy. On the other, he has told Chinese citizens to report potential spies and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/17/us/politics/us-china-global-spy-operations.html" title="">empowered his security agencies</a> to arrest so-called subversives, whether justified or not.</p><p>Mr. Dong’s sentencing appears intended to force a limiting of contacts between Chinese citizens and foreigners. Mr. Dong met openly with diplomats from Japan and the United States, as well as with international scholars, journalists and other foreigners.</p><p>The judgment read aloud in court on Friday accused the Japanese Embassy in Beijing of being an “espionage organization” and named several Japanese diplomats Mr. Dong knew, including a former Japanese ambassador and the current chief diplomat in Shanghai, as agents, according to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-press-club-family-statement-on-verdict-in-case-of-chinese-journalist-dong-yuyu-302319121.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from Mr. Dong’s family. The Japanese foreign ministry has said its diplomatic missions engage in “legitimate duties carried out by diplomats.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Dong’s wife lives in Beijing, and his son in Washington. The son, Yifu Dong, graduated from Yale University and Boston University School of Law. The family plans to appeal the verdict and sentence and said that, in any case, China should release Mr. Dong on humanitarian grounds, given his age and a liver condition that has required monitoring during his detention.</p><p>They said the sentence was a “grave injustice” to “every freethinking Chinese journalist and every ordinary Chinese committed to friendly engagement with the world.”</p><p>This week, China and the United States did a prisoner swap in which China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/asia/us-china-prisoner-swap.html" title="">released three imprisoned American citizens</a> and several people who had been prevented from leaving China for years under an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/us/politics/china-exit-ban.html" title="">exit ban</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.press.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Press Club</a> in Washington has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-press-club-statement-on-verdict-in-case-of-journalist-dong-yuyu-302318897.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the sentencing of Mr. Dong. And his imprisonment could increase tensions between Harvard University and Chinese leaders, many of whom want their children to attend the university. Mr. Xi’s daughter, Xi Mingze, is a Harvard alumna.</p><p>Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard, <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/dong-yuyu-nf-07-unjustly-sentenced-to-seven-years-in-prison-in-china/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Mr. Dong “is a cherished member of the international Nieman fellows community, where he is known for the care and diligence he has brought to his writing. We stand with many in hoping for a speedy reversal of this harsh decision so he may return to his family as soon as possible.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edward Wong reports on global affairs, U.S. foreign policy and the State Department.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/edward-wong">More about Edward Wong</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>U.S. Condemns China’s Sentencing of a Journalist Convicted of Espionage<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/ministry-of-state-security-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china">Ministry of State Security of the People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/state-department">State Department</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Biden Cuts Intel’s Chip Award: </strong>The Silicon Valley company will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/economy/intel-chips-award-biden.html">receive less money from the CHIPS Act</a> after winning a $3 billion military contract and changing some of its investment commitments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obesity Drugs: </strong>The Biden administration, in one of its last major policy directives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/upshot/obesity-drugs-medicare-medicaid.html">proposed that Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity medications</a>, a costly and probably popular move that the Trump administration would need to endorse to become official.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blinken and U.S. Allies Struggle with Wars: </strong>Top diplomats from the Group of 7 nations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/europe/blinken-allies-biden-presidency.html">tried to project unity on Ukraine while discussing differences over Israel</a> and anticipating the return of President-elect Donald Trump.</p></li><li><p><strong>Electric Vehicles: </strong>The Biden administration will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/biden-loans-ev-auto-industry.html">lend $6 billion to help Rivian build an electric car factory</a> in Georgia, part of an effort to lock in Democratic climate policies before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intel’s Chip Grant: </strong>The Biden administration plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/business/washington-curtails-intel-grant.html">reduce Intel’s preliminary $8.5 billion federal CHIPS grant</a>, a move that follows the company’s investment delays and broader business struggles.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
