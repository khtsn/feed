name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Maggie Smith, who was 89 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/arts/maggie-smith-dead.html" title="">when she died on Friday</a>, made her professional stage debut on Broadway in the 1950s, when she was still in her early 20s. In the decades that followed, she worked steadily in movies and television, while regularly returning to the theater.</p><p>Smith won her first Oscar for the title role in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXA0N55c3iw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</a>” (1969), a charismatic and manipulative teacher who has a profound and, at times, destructive effect on the lives of the teenage girls in her charge. She went on to win another Oscar, a Tony and four Emmys, and became known in her later years for playing a particular type of Englishwoman: sturdy, smart, sharp-tongued and rooted sometimes stubbornly in the traditions of the past.</p><p>Audiences in the 21st century came to love Smith in two recurring roles: as the heroic Professor Minerva McGonagall in the “Harry Potter” movies and as the coolly disapproving dowager countess Violet Crawley in the period TV drama “Downton Abbey.” But her career was long and eclectic, with a mix of serious and comic characters, in both supporting and leading roles. Here are 10 of Smith’s best performances that are available to stream:</p></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAHSb9UVJMM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>1972</p><h2 id="link-7ab0a62f">‘Travels With My Aunt’</h2><p>Rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0087YOK0M" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/travels-with-my-aunt/id533033959?ign-mpt=uo=4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Travels_with_My_Aunt?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=UJHUe_4aHtI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Travels-with-My-Aunt/98497" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vudu</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJHUe_4aHtI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Though she was only in her late 30s at the time, Smith took an early step toward her most familiar screen persona — the dynamic and unforgettable older relative — in this adaptation of Graham Greene’s offbeat adventure novel. Filling in for Katharine Hepburn (who differed with the studio and with her old friend, the director George Cukor, on how best to tell her character’s story), Smith ended up nabbing her third Oscar nomination, playing the eccentric globe-trotter Augusta Bertram, who enlists a stuffy, middle-aged Londoner in one of her illicit moneymaking schemes while hiding her true connection to him. Smith builds an outsize yet complex character via flashbacks that show how she learned to eschew conventional mores and to enjoy life on her own terms.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>1976</p><h2 id="link-144bc9a9">‘Murder by Death’</h2><p>Rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B001IWV030" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/murder-by-death/id293106100?ign-mpt=uo=4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Murder_By_Death?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=SU0cFbUublQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Murder-by-Death/24061" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vudu</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU0cFbUublQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p><p>Written by Neil Simon, this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/24/archives/simons-breezy-murder-by-death.html#:~:text=All%20of%20the%20performances%20are,toupee%20and%20his%20eating%20habits." title="">parody</a> of country house murder-mysteries — the kind where a bunch of disparate folks gather for a weekend and someone winds up dead — has a cast of veteran actors playing spoof versions of some classic literary and movie detectives. Smith is paired with David Niven, who play Dora and Dick Charleston, a witty, high-society couple in the mold of Nick and Nora Charles from “The Thin Man.” Though the film is silly by design, Smith looks to be having a marvelous time swapping acerbic quips with her husband and the other guests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>1978</p><h2 id="link-5d2153e3">‘California Suite’</h2><p>Rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B001GLUQGK" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/california-suite/id299182488?ign-mpt=uo=4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/California_Suite?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=Ew2DQ5H_Ob0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/California-Suite/24070" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vudu</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew2DQ5H_Ob0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Two years after “Murder by Death,” Smith tackled another Neil Simon script and won her second Oscar, aptly, for playing a British actress who’s been nominated for an Academy Award. Based on Simon’s play, “California Suite” is made up of four short vignettes, each set in a ritzy Beverly Hills hotel. Smith’s segment has her opposite Michael Caine as her character’s not-so-secretly-gay husband. The role allowed Smith to explore some of the anxieties of being a respected middle-aged movie star, known more for small, arty pictures than blockbusters.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>1982</p><h2 id="link-73f27b5a">‘Evil Under the Sun’</h2><p>Stream it on BritBox; rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B002WFVF4Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Evil_Under_The_Sun?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=nfLODkdJn8U" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Evil-Under-the-Sun/19944" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vudu</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2byKmRaeJ_k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p><p>In the 1970s and ’80s, the actor Peter Ustinov played Agatha Christie’s persnickety Belgian detective Hercule Poirot in a popular series of feature films and TV movies. Smith appeared in two of the big-screen outings: “Death on the Nile” (1978) and “Evil Under the Sun” (1982). Both are highly entertaining, but the ’82 film is superior both as a mystery — with a clever plot involving a murder for which every suspect seemingly has an airtight alibi — and as a showcase for Smith, who is wryly funny as a hotelier who has hilariously cutting comments to make about her more troublesome guests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>1984</p><h2 id="link-31a0665b">‘A Private Function’</h2><p>Stream it on <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/a-private-function" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Criterion Channel</a>.</p><p>Though Smith won only two Oscars (from six nominations), she was a regular at the BAFTAs throughout her career, often winning awards for movies that barely made a ripple in the United States. She took home the best actress prize for this small gem: a subtle social satire, set just after World War II, about a small English town where the locals are beginning to turn on one another over the government’s food-rationing laws. Smith plays an ambitious middle-class wife who’s fed up with living a life of enforced poverty, and who urges her timid husband (Michael Palin) to steal a pig. She excels in the role of someone who is both manipulative and sympathetic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>1985</p><h2 id="link-55524305">‘A Room With a View’</h2><p>Stream it on <a href="https://www.max.com/movies/room-with-a-view/2327f7ad-5282-4da9-b952-a2051b205e85" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Max</a>, BritBox or <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/a-room-with-a-view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Criterion Channel</a>; rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00QRODSC0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/A_Room_with_a_View?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=YAvGlWTYvLc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/A-Room-With-a-View/1336" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vudu</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAvGlWTYvLc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p><p>The director James Ivory, the screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and the producer Ismail Merchant had an Oscar-winning box-office hit with their adaptation of the E.M. Forster’s charming romance set against the picturesque backdrops of rural England and Italy’s Tuscany region. The story is about a young woman named Lucy (Helena Bonham Carter) whose carefully planned life is upended when she meets a freethinking hunk (Julian Sands). Smith plays a key role as Lucy’s dreary older cousin, whose fussy, gossipy nature ultimately helps drive the heroine to seek something more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>1987</p><h2 id="link-115899d3">‘The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne’</h2><p>Stream it on <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-lonely-passion-of-judith-hearne" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Criterion Channel</a>.</p><p>In another BAFTA-winning performance, Smith plays an alcoholic piano teacher named Judith, living alone in a Dublin boardinghouse and still holding out hope she might meet and marry the man of her dreams. Bob Hoskins plays her latest prospect, James, a restless schemer from America, who mistakenly thinks Judith has enough money to invest in his business. Based on a Brian Moore novel, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/23/movies/film-lonely-passion-of-judith-hearne.html" title="">The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne</a>” is a muted and melancholy film, featuring one of Smith’s richest, if saddest, performances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>1992</p><h2 id="link-2a7ebe7b">‘Sister Act’</h2><p>Stream it on <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/sister-act/70Zz3F8TI5LO?irclickid=X0P28N3MFxyORdW07OwzdzZ-UkEQJb2QER0OSE0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;cid=DSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-JustWatch%20GmbH-707638" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Disney+</a>; rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00CLNVOL8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/sister-act/id599494761?ign-mpt=uo=4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Sister_Act?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=dfo4r-VNCOA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Sister-Act/22330" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vudu</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfo4r-VNCOA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p><p>In the 1990s and beyond, Smith became an in-demand character actor, lending her withering glares and dryly disdainful line readings to more comic supporting roles. She had one of her most high-profile parts in the musical comedy “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/29/movies/review-film-whoopi-goldberg-on-the-run-disguised-as-a-nun.html" title="">Sister Act</a>,” playing a grumpy old nun who makes life miserable for Deloris (Whoopi Goldberg), a key witness in a criminal trial who hides out in a financially struggling convent. Smith’s turn as the Reverend Mother is remarkably well-rounded — both funny and poignant — as she plays someone whose authoritarian bent masks her worry that she’s become old and out of touch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>2001</p><h2 id="link-5da07af7">‘Gosford Park’</h2><p>Rent or buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B000I543SM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/gosford-park/id284989889?ign-mpt=uo=4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Gosford_Park?gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=mg-poyFUXMQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Gosford-Park/5173" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vudu</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg-poyFUXMQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p><p>In Robert Altman’s lightly satirical and enormously entertaining murder-mystery, Smith is part of an ensemble of excellent British and American actors, all playing an assortment of 1930s aristocrats and servants gathered at a country house for a weekend of hunting and socializing. Nearly everyone in the film has something pithy or snide to say about nearly everyone else, but Smith has the keenest wit as a countess who coolly dissects the vulgar Americans in their midst.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>2010-15</p><h2 id="link-6a352b18">‘Downton Abbey’</h2><p>Stream it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B004KAQQ5E" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>, BritBox or <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/downton-abbey/7560296579355862112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peacock</a>; buy it on <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/downton-abbey/umc.cmc.1ko2xez06342em3hczdnjzno2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/tv/show?amp&amp;cdid=tvseason-AtbCyQbs0LER8rlV-GoSAw&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;id=-mIWfBDspZZu22SdJooEmA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a> or <a href="https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/Downton-Abbey-Season-1/1436293" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vudu</a>.</p><p>This long-running TV and movie series was created by Julian Fellowes, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of “Gosford Park,” who used the project to expand on one of that film’s central themes: the huge changes in English culture in the 20th century, as members of the landowning aristocracy saw their power and influence over their servants and tenants wane. Smith plays a wealthy family’s irritable old matriarch: a dowager countess who vocally decries nearly every move toward modernity. Over the course of the long “Downton Abbey” run, Smith made the character more than just a collection of gripes, finding the relatable humanity within a woman watching the rapid decline of a world she once ruled.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/maggie-smith">Maggie Smith</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
