                      <p>Four events to send invites from February VRS</p>
                    </div>
                  </a>
                  <p>IEM Krakow carried extra importance, as the invitation deadline for four sizable events — BLAST Open Rotterdam, PGL Bucharest, IEM Atlanta, and CS Asia Championships — came around on February 2, following the conclusion of Stage 1 of the event. As such, IEM Krakow gave teams an important opportunity to make a last-minute leap in the VRS.</p>
                  <p>Of course, not everyone came away from IEM Krakow with an improvement in the rankings. Some teams took big hits in the VRS as a result of their Krakow results, leaving them in difficult positions as the IEM Cologne Major deadline of April 6 approaches.</p>
                  
                  <h2>G2 (#17 -&gt; #10)</h2>
                  <p>Skipping over BLAST Bounty to start 2026 left <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid937371475">G2</a> with limited opportunities to climb up the VRS ahead of the February 2 invitation deadline, but they certainly capitalized during their IEM Krakow campaign. Starting in Stage 1 gave them the chance to secure more points ahead of the deadline, with their victories over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5973/liquid" data-tooltip-id="uid1056247121">Liquid</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12426/passion-ua" data-tooltip-id="uid1333311441">Passion UA</a> earning them a place at #13 overall heading into Stage 2.</p>
                  <p>This boost in the rankings left them tantalizingly close to a BLAST Open Rotterdam invite, but with all twelve teams above them in the rankings locking in their spot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid937371475">G2</a> were ultimately left in the dust for the Dutch event.</p>

                      <p>BLAST unveils Open Rotterdam invites</p>
                    </div>
                  </a>
                  <p>Their Stage 1 efforts were not entirely fruitless — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3972/hunter" data-tooltip-id="uid2093335380">Nemanja <span>&#34;⁠huNter-⁠&#34;</span> Kovač</a>&#39;s men sit just inside the cusp of the global top fourteen for a CS Asia Championships invite in May, should they choose to attend, and they are first in line for PGL Bucharest if any other invitations are declined. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid937371475">G2</a> would have certainly liked to have earned a BLAST Open Rotterdam spot ahead of the Cologne Major cutoff, it&#39;s hard to be frustrated at the outcome given their delicate spot in the VRS at the start of the event.</p>

                    <p>G2 made up for skipping BLAST Bounty with their Krakow showing</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid937371475">G2</a>&#39;s rise in the VRS did not stop after their Stage 1 campaign ended. With wins over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6248/the-mongolz" data-tooltip-id="uid1146384567">The MongolZ</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid2056544568">FUT</a>, and an eventual quarter-final finish, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid937371475">G2</a> managed to wrap up the Polish event with the #10 spot in the world. As such, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid937371475">G2</a> are also in a solid position to push for PGL Astana and BLAST Rivals invites at the March 2 deadline, contingent on a respectable finish at the upcoming PGL Cluj-Napoca.</p>
                  <h2>FUT (#26 -&gt; #16)</h2>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid2056544568">FUT</a> entered Stage 1 of IEM Krakow as the second-lowest VRS-ranked team in attendance at #26 in the world, dragged down by woeful losses to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/11737/eyeballers" data-tooltip-id="uid1686543594">EYEBALLERS</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/10254/big-academy" data-tooltip-id="uid2034365151">BIG Academy</a> in the recent IEM Rio closed qualifier. As such, their Stage 1 victories over #13 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12468/legacy" data-tooltip-id="uid230711442">Legacy</a> and #12 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5973/liquid" data-tooltip-id="uid1056247121">Liquid</a> carried immense weight, allowing the young international side to break into the 19th spot in the world ranking heading into the February 2 cutoff.</p>
                  <p>Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid937371475">G2</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid2056544568">FUT</a> were within touching distance to some event invites, but ultimately came up just shy, netting only an invitation to IEM Atlanta as a result of a substantial amount of declined invites from higher-ranked teams, likely due to the event&#39;s overlap with PGL Astana and difficulties attaining visas for an American event. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid2056544568">FUT</a> are also in a good position to capitalize on any declines for PGL Bucharest, with the potential to earn a closed qualifier spot or even potentially a direct place in the main event, depending on the number of declined invites.</p>

                  </a>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid2056544568">FUT</a> managed to improve on their Stage 1 success even further once in the top sixteen of the event, claiming the VRS #1 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/8297/furia" data-tooltip-id="uid320174442">FURIA</a>&#39;s scalp in their opening match. Though they faltered in their next two games against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid937371475">G2</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1772883247">Astralis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid2056544568">FUT</a> still came out of Stage 2 with a net positive, ending the event as #16 in the world, a ten-spot climb from where they started.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid2056544568">FUT</a> have now given themselves a fighting chance to vie for an Astana, Rivals, or FISSURE Playground invitation come March 2, with PGL Cluj-Napoca being their best opportunity to make a push for it. Looking further, while much can still happen between now and the April 6 IEM Cologne Major invitation deadline, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/22203/krabeni" data-tooltip-id="uid1259675754">Aulon <span>&#34;⁠Krabeni⁠&#34;</span> Fazlija</a>&#39;s troops have also given themselves some margin for error as they aim for their organization&#39;s debut Major appearance.</p>
                  <h2>Astralis (#16 -&gt; #11)</h2>
                  <p>Rounding out the victors of IEM Krakow&#39;s VRS battle is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1772883247">Astralis</a>, who climbed five places with their newly international roster, coming just shy of a stage appearance before narrowly falling to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/8297/furia" data-tooltip-id="uid320174442">FURIA</a>.</p>
                  <p>Though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1772883247">Astralis</a> started in Stage 1, they did not make substantial gains from their first few matches in Poland. Wins over comparably ranked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4773/pain" data-tooltip-id="uid1987546901">paiN</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/9928/gamerlegion" data-tooltip-id="uid1333601431">GamerLegion</a> were certainly helpful, but a loss to #21-ranked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6673/nrg" data-tooltip-id="uid699731437">NRG</a> dashed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1772883247">Astralis</a>&#39;s hopes of making a last-ditch climb up the rankings before the February 2 cutoff. As such, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1772883247">Astralis</a> only came away with an invitation to IEM Atlanta by virtue of the numerous declined invitations, and at minimum a closed qualifier spot for PGL Bucharest.</p>

All told, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1772883247">Astralis</a> rounded out their IEM Krakow campaign as #11 in the world, hardly missing a beat after transitioning to an English-speaking lineup. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1772883247">Astralis</a> are now in a prime position to gun for some of the March 2 cutoff events as they gear up for PGL Cluj-Napoca, while their ESL Pro League outing will also allow them to stay competitive for an IEM Cologne Major spot.</p>

This is in large part thanks to the fact that they have already secured invites for PGL Cluj-Napoca and ESL Pro League Season 23, giving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/7175/heroic" data-tooltip-id="uid59972649">HEROIC</a> some chances to at least stay competitive for invitations to the March 2 deadline events and an IEM Cologne Major spot.</p>
