He was 53.</p><p>His death was announced <a href="https://brinx.tv/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> by Brinx TV, the media production company he founded. Mr. Brenkus “had been battling depression,” the statement said. “John lost his fight with this terrible illness.”</p><p>Brinx and family members did not immediately respond to requests for further details or comment.</p><p>“Sport Science” appeared on Fox Sports Network starting in 2007, and then on ESPN into the 2010s, winning six Emmys. Mr. Brenkus gained a following with his energetic personality as the show demonstrated sports through scientific principles and concepts, and science through sports, with engaging segments.</p><p>Mr. Brenkus’s program was also whimsical and fun. He showed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS8xaWleuRk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how golfers</a> were able to drive balls such great distances, how snowboarders’ quad flips generated a force of four Gs and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYdR5kMzqJo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">physics of Wiffle balls</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He subjected the N.F.L. running back Saquon Barkley to <a href="https://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=20289703" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">various weather conditions</a> in a laboratory, drenching him with water and setting the temperature from 20 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. (Mr. Barkley barely slowed down.)</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6bxer5/im_john_brenkus_hostcreator_of_espns_sport/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asked on a Reddit</a> forum eight years ago about his favorite segment, he cited a piece on the contact between ball and bat in Major League Baseball. “You could, theoretically, let go of the bat .001 seconds before contact and the ball will travel just as far,” he said.</p><p>John Brenkus was born July 2, 1971, in Washington, D.C. He attended the University of Virginia and originally aspired to be a film director.</p><p>In 2008 he was the executive producer of “Crime 360,” a show that followed real criminal investigations as they progressed. In 2010, his book “The Perfection Point” made the New York Times best-seller list. It calculated the limits of athletic performance, concluding that theoretically humans could run the 100-meter dash in 8.99 seconds, complete a marathon in 1:57:58 and dunk a basketball in a hoop 14 feet 5 inches off the ground.</p><p>Kitty Bennett contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
