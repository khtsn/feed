It is now my belief that the federal government intends to charge me with crimes. If so, these charges would be entirely false based on lies. But they would not be surprising. I always knew that if I stood my ground for all of you, that I would be a target. And a target I became. I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit. If I’m charged, I know I’m innocent. I will request an immediate trial so that New Yorkers can hear the truth. I have been facing these lies for months since I began to speak out for all of you and their investigation started. Yet the city has continued to improve. Make no mistake. You elected me to lead this city. And lead it I will. I humbly ask for your prayers and your patience as we see this through. God bless you and God bless the City of New York. Thank you.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/25/multimedia/VIDEO-UPDATE-cltv/VIDEO-UPDATE-cltv-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In a videotaped speech, Mr. Adams said any charges against him would be “false” and said that he will continue to lead as mayor of the city.</span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emma-g-fitzsimmons"><img alt="Emma G.

He appeared to be speaking at Gracie Mansion; it appeared that he recorded the video before he knew he had been indicted.</p><p>“If I am charged, I know I am innocent,” he said. “I will request an immediate trial so that New Yorkers can hear the truth.”</p><p>Mr. Adams, the city’s second Black mayor, won a competitive Democratic primary in 2021 on a public safety message. As a former police officer, he has said that he follows the law and instructs city officials to do the same.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He vowed to continue as mayor despite a series of high-profile departures from his administration, including his police commissioner, schools chancellor and health commissioner.</p><p>“I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit,” he said, his demeanor alternating from sober to indignant.</p><p>Mr. Adams has had a rocky relationship with the Biden administration over the migrant crisis, and the mayor has warned that it would destroy New York City. He mentioned that battle as an example of how he had fought injustices during his career and appeared to suggest that it might be a reason he was targeted.</p><p>“Despite our pleas, when the federal government did nothing as its broken immigration policies overloaded our shelter system with no relief, I put the people of New York before party and politics,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Adams ended the speech with a reference to his faith, a central part of his biography. The mayor has said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/nyregion/adams-religion-prayer.html" title="">God told him that he would be mayor</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I humbly ask for your prayers and your patience as we see this through,” he said. “God bless you and God bless the city of New York.”</p></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Adams Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Adams’s Foreign Ties</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Federal prosecutors investigating Mayor Eric Adams and his 2021 campaign’s ties to Turkey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/nyregion/fbi-adams-qatar-israel-china-uzbekistan-korea.html">issued subpoenas for records related to five other countries</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Investigations Swirl</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The inquiry into the mayor and his campaign is among <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html">several federal corruption investigations</a> that have reached people in Adams’s orbit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stop and Frisk</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The N.Y.P.D.’s discipline for illegal street detentions is lax at every level — a failure that reaches all the way to the top of the force — according to a review ordered by a federal judge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health Commissioner Resigns</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who led the city out of the pandemic, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/nyregion/vasan-health-commissioner-resigns.html">the third top Adams administration official to quit in recent weeks</a> amid the investigations of Adams’s inner circle.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Migrant Crisis</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>It’s been a year since Adams made his ominous prediction that the migrant crisis would “destroy New York City.” It didn’t, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/nyregion/mayor-adams-migrant-crisis-ny.html">challenges remain</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
