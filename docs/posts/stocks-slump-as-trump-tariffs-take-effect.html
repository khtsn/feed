The Nasdaq Composite index dropped roughly 1 percent, putting it briefly in what is known as a correction — a drop of 10 percent or more from its recent peak.</p><p>The sharp moves in recent days have wiped out much of the stock gains made since Mr. Trump’s election victory in November, as investors’ hopes of deregulation, business-friendly policies and restraint on tariffs have given way to fears over the potentially damaging impact of the levies that went into effect on Tuesday.</p><p>Investors appeared to rush into the safety of government debt, helping to lower the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its lowest level since October. Yields move inversely to prices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mounting concerns about the economy’s ability to withstand incoming tariffs for too long were also evident in a shift in investor expectations of the number of times the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.</p><p>In the near term, tariffs are likely to accelerate inflation, with the Fed holding rates elevated to deal with it. But the longer-term effect, economists say, will be slower economic growth and the risk of an economic downturn, in which the Fed would very likely rapidly cut interest rates.</p><p>Investors now expect the central bank to cut rates as many as three times this year, beginning in June, a sudden change from early this year when they predicted just one rate cut. That shift appeared to reflect worries that the Fed will be pushed into lowering rates quickly later in the year to prop up an ailing economy.</p><p>“While a trade war might have short-term reflationary implications,” said Ian Lyngen, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Market, “it also carries with it significant risks to global growth.”</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite has fallen almost 10 percent from its high in December, although much of the sell-off has materialized over the past two weeks. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 6 percent from its high set less than one month ago. The decline of major stock indexes toward corrections and bear markets plays a psychological role in the market, signaling to traders that a sell-off may not be just a brief blip but that it has extended to a point of significantly lowering company valuations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which is more exposed to the outlook for the U.S. economy, has already fallen into correction and is now approaching a bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its recent peak. The index reached a new high only in November, after a drastic recovery under the previous administration.</p><p>The stock declines on Tuesday were broad based, with roughly four out of five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 lower for the day. Ford fell roughly 3 percent as did General Motors, while Tesla dropped roughly 5 percent. Financial stocks, along with consumer discretionary stocks like cruise lines and restaurants, were the hardest-hit sectors of the index.</p><p>Airlines, which were already facing simmering concerns from investors, also suffered steep losses amid fears that a trade war could slow the economy and rein in travel spending. United Airlines fell nearly 7 percent, while Delta dropped about 6 percent.</p><p>European stocks had earlier come under pressure as investors weighed the prospects of a global trade war after China and Canada quickly imposed tariffs of their own.</p><p>The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which comprises the eurozone’s largest companies, fell 2.5 percent, its worst one-day performance since July 2023. Germany’s benchmark index, the DAX, dropped 3.5 percent, erasing its gains from the previous day when it hit a record on the promises for more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/europe/starmer-zelensky-meeting-europe-ukraine-trump.html" title="">European military spending</a>. It is the German benchmark’s worst day in roughly three years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Shares of German automakers and suppliers were hit especially hard as many have assembly plants in Mexico for vehicles they sell in the United States. Volkswagen’s shares fell about 3 percent and BMW’s dropped more than 5 percent. </p><p>The U.S. dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of other major currencies, was 0.5 percent lower, despite both the Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso weakening.</p><p>Oil prices also fell after the Opec oil cartel and some of its allies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-opec-production.html" title="">said</a> on Monday that they would increase production. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped 1.5 percent to $70.53 a barrel.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eshe-nelson">More about Eshe Nelson</a></span></p></div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy">More about Melissa Eddy</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
