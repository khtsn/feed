German automakers, many of which have plants in Mexico that make vehicles that are sold in the United States, were especially hard hit.</p><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="markets-embed-sp" data-id="100000008938528" data-source-id="100000008938528"></section><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-03-04T09:40:36-05:00"><span>March 4, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>9:40 a.m. ET</span></span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Global stocks tumbled on Tuesday as investors’ concerns over the future health of the economy mounted after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/tariffs-us-canada-mexico-china" title="">President Trump’s broad tariffs</a> against Canada, Mexico and China went into effect.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.7 percent at the start of trading on Tuesday, adding to the 1.8 percent loss on Monday that was its sharpest decline this year. Investors appeared to rush into the safety of government debt, helping to lower the yield — yields move inversely to prices — on the 10-year Treasury note to its lowest since October.</p><p>The drop in yields, however, also signaled mounting concerns about the ability of the economy to withstand incoming tariffs for too long. That concern was also evident in a shift in expectations for the number of times the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Investors now expect the central bank to cut rates as many as three times this year, a sudden change that reflects worries that the Fed will be pushed into lowering rates quickly to prop up an ailing economy.</p><p>“While a trade war might have short-term reflationary implications,” said Ian Lyngen, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Market, “it also carries with it significant risks to global growth.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>European stocks had earlier slumped as investors weighed the prospects of a global trade war after China and Canada quickly imposed tariffs of their own.</p><p>The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which comprises the eurozone’s largest companies, fell as much as 2.4 percent, its worst performance in about four months. Germany’s benchmark index, the DAX, dropped as much as 2.7 percent, erasing nearly all of its gains from the previous day when it hit a record on the promises for more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/europe/starmer-zelensky-meeting-europe-ukraine-trump.html" title="">European military spending</a>.</p><p>Shares of German automakers and suppliers were hit especially hard as many have assembly plants in Mexico for vehicles they sell in the United States. Volkswagen shares fell about 4 percent, BMW’s shares dropped more than 5 percent. Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner and Thomas Built Buses, slid more than 6 percent. Continental, a maker of auto parts that also produces in Mexico, fell 9 percent.</p><p>The U.S. dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of other major currencies, was 0.5 percent lower. The Canadian dollar hit a one-month low against the dollar before recovering its losses.</p><p>But the Mexican peso remained weaker against the U.S. dollar, its fourth consecutive day of declines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Oil prices also fell after the Opec oil cartel and some of its allies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/energy-environment/oil-prices-opec-production.html" title="">said</a> on Monday that they would increase production. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped 1.6 percent to $70.47 a barrel.</p><p>Amid a heavy morning of losses, some European defense companies held on to gains as the European Commission proposed additional military spending, including a measure that would provide 150 billion euros ($158 billion) in loans to E.U. countries for defense investment. Shares in the German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall rose 1 percent, extending a 14 percent gain from the day before. Shares of BAE Systems, a British defense contractor, rose 1 percent after climbing 15 percent on Monday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eshe-nelson">More about Eshe Nelson</a></span></p></div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy">More about Melissa Eddy</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
