The fact is that your own lawyer said that you entered into an N.D.A. and paid a person who accused you of raping her a sum of money to make sure that she did not file a complaint. I have read multiple reports of your regularly being drunk at work. Will you resign as secretary of defense if you drink on the job, which is a 24/7 position?” “I’ve made this commitment on behalf of —” “Will you resign as secretary of defense?” “I’ve made this commitment on behalf of the men and women I’m serving —” “I’m not hearing an answer to my question. So I’m going to move on.” “You claim that this was all anonymous. We have seen records with names attached to all of these, including the name of your own mother. So don’t make this into some anonymous press thing.” “I’m quoting you from the podcast. ‘Women shouldn’t be in combat at all.’ What I see is that there’s a 32-day period in which you suddenly have another description about your views of women in the military, and I just want to know what changed in the 32 days that the song you sang is not the song you come in here today to sing?” “Senator, the concerns I have and the concerns of many have had, especially in ground combat units, is that in pursuit of certain percentages or quotas, standards have been changed.” “Our adversaries watch closely during times of transition, and any sense that the Department of Defense that keeps us safe is being steered by someone who is wholly unprepared for the job, puts America at risk. And I am not willing to do that.” “I know what I don’t know. I know I’ve never run an organization of three million people with a budget of $850 billion.” “Why do you want to do this job? What’s your, what drives you?” “Because I love my country, Senator. And I’ve dedicated my life to the warfighters.” “He is a decorated post-9/11 combat veteran. He will inject a new warrior ethos into the Pentagon, a spirit that can cascade from the top down.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14dc-hegseth-takeways3-hjwp/14dc-hegseth-takeways3-hjwp-threeByTwoLargeAt2X.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee called Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald J.

Democrats derided him as blatantly unqualified to oversee the Defense Department’s three million employees and $849 billion budget. Republicans acknowledged that he was an unconventional pick, but said he was just what the Pentagon needed. And Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican who is an influential member of the panel, said after the hearing that she had been won over.</p><p>Here are four takeaways from the hearing:</p><h2 id="link-21af8dc7">Hegseth looks as if he has the votes to get out of committee.</h2><p>Despite all the fireworks at the proceeding, it seems that Mr. Hegseth has the votes he needs to move on. None of his answers seemed to disturb the Republicans who control the committee.</p><p>A vote has been scheduled for Monday after President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in and Mr. Hegseth’s nomination is expected to become official.</p><p>Less than six weeks ago, Ms. Ernst, a veteran with a reputation for being a principled leader on matters of sexual assault and the military, had voiced reservations about Mr. Hegseth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Mr. Trump’s hard-line backers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eaFT54Lu60&amp;t" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid for ads</a> in Ms. Ernst’s home state, <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1864686299300454403" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questioned her Republican bona fides</a> on social media and even <a href="https://x.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/1865093824219091454" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatened to run</a> primary challenges against her in 2026 to push her toward backing Mr. Hegseth as the nominee.</p><p>Several hours after the hearing ended, she announced her support for him on WHO Newsradio 1040, a radio station in Des Moines.</p><p>Her questioning of Mr. Hegseth during the session was friendly. She pressed him repeatedly on the importance of auditing the Pentagon — a relatively safe topic. She also encouraged him to repeat promises she has said he had made to her privately about appointing a senior officer to strengthen her past work to prevent sexual assault and rape in the military.</p><p>Her support suggests that, barring new developments, Mr. Hegseth is now on a path to winning confirmation by the full Senate. Ms. Ernst was considered a key vote who could sway other Republicans. With her on board, his prospects of success have grown.</p><h2 id="link-44d9de17">Hegseth portrayed his life as a redemption story.</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth repeatedly refused to say whether an accusation of sexual assault or excessive drinking or marital infidelity should disqualify someone from leading the Pentagon. He also did not promise that he’d resign if he were to break his promise not to drink if confirmed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In general, he skirted specific allegations about his personal conduct, simply claiming that he had been the victim of false allegations by anonymous sources, circulated by media organizations he said were determined to destroy him.</p><p>“I’m not a perfect person, but redemption is real.” he said at one point. He also said, “I have failed in things in my life, and thankfully I’m redeemed by my lord and savior Jesus.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Tim Kaine, in a suit with a pink tie, speaking into a microphone and pointing with his left hand during the hearing." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv/14dc-hegseth-takeways-kaine-hlmv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/5aba143d-ca99-5b16-9917-4fe96dbb0e04" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, asked Mr. Hegseth about allegations from former colleagues of his who claimed that he drank excessively, his admitted extramarital affairs and the sexual assault allegation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The one senator who seemed to get under his skin was Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. Mr. Kaine pressed him about the allegation that he raped a woman in 2017 in Monterey, Calif., while he was married to his second wife and two months after his girlfriend, now his third wife, had given birth to his child.</p><p>The episode resulted in no criminal charges. Mr. Hegseth, who said the encounter was consensual, paid the woman an undisclosed amount in a settlement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“So you think you are completely cleared because you committed no crime?” Mr. Kaine demanded. “How do you explain your judgment?”</p><h2 id="link-3f0b0901">He faced fierce queries about his views on women in combat.</h2><p>Some of the toughest questioning was over Mr. Hegseth’s previous statements that women should not serve in combat roles. Democratic senators accused him of modulating those views purely in hopes of winning a cabinet post.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth said: “Yes, women will have access to ground combat roles, given the standards remain high, and we will have a review to ensure the standards have not been eroded.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, told Hegseth that his statements about women in combat roles are “brutal, and they’re mean, and they disrespect men and women who are willing to die for this country.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Female Democrats in particular assailed him over his earlier comments.

He said they would.</p><h2 id="link-514ee4e6">Republicans praised his communication skills, honed as a television anchor.</h2><p>Mr. Hegseth and his Republican allies on the panel made the case that his lack of experience compared with previous defense secretaries would be a plus.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth said: “As President Trump also told me, we’ve repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly the right credentials, whether they’re retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives. And where has it gotten us?”</p><p>Republican senators hailed his skills as a communicator. After running two small nonprofit organizations, both of which ended up in debt, Mr. Hegseth was a weekend anchor on “Fox &amp; Friends” for seven years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>During the hearing, he generally spoke confidently, typically revealing little evidence of being rattled.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hegseth leaving his confirmation hearing on Tuesday.
