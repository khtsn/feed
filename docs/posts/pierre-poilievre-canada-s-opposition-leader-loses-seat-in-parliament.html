    <h1>Pierre Poilievre, Canada’s Opposition Leader, Loses Seat in Parliament</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, was unseated as the parliamentary representative of his Ottawa district in a stunning upset that could put his leadership of the party in question.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre was first elected in 2004 as the member of Parliament representing Carleton, a largely rural district bordering parts of the Ottawa River. His long-held Conservative seat was flipped to the Liberal Party.</p><p>Bruce Fanjoy, the Liberal candidate who is a well-known community volunteer but was initially considered a long shot, won the race.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre embraced some of Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, railing against “radical woke ideology” while pledging to defund Canada’s national broadcaster and cut foreign aid.</p></div></div>
