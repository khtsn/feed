In 2023, Hanwha Qcells, a Korean solar company, announced it would invest $2.5 billion to expand its factory in Dalton, creating the largest solar panel manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>“It’s a newer technology for us, but it’s one we’re excited to be making right here,” said Jason Mock, president of the Greater Dalton Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>If all the solar factories currently planned in the United States get built, the country would have the capacity to produce three times as many solar panel modules as were installed in 2024, <a href="https://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/reports/us-clean-energy-supply-chains-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to an analysis</a> by the Rhodium Group and M.I.T. Yet the solar industry is still reliant on countries like China for many underlying components, such as the polysilicon wafers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It’s a similar story for batteries: The number of U.S. factories that are currently planned would build enough lithium-ion modules and cells to satisfy future demand for electric vehicles, although progress has been much slower in building up domestic supplies of raw ingredients like graphite and lithium.</p><p>It’s not clear if those supply chains will survive. In the House draft bill, Republicans proposed sharp new restrictions on the use of materials from China, which could make it difficult for many U.S. factories to qualify.</p><p>The bill would also end by next year a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric cars that is available for buyers of cars largely produced in the United States. That would reduce demand for electric vehicles, which would in turn affect a broad swath of battery manufacturing and demand for critical minerals like lithium.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/00cli-energy-invest-01-cqtp/00cli-energy-invest-01-cqtp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/00cli-energy-invest-01-cqtp/00cli-energy-invest-01-cqtp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/00cli-energy-invest-01-cqtp/00cli-energy-invest-01-cqtp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A blue solar panel on a conveyor belt.

Local politicians, who spent years persuading Hyundai to come to the site, are concerned about possible changes to law.</p><p>“It’s difficult for a company to invest somewhere and then conditions change,” said Bert Brantley, chief executive of the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce. “So our take is that some consistency is helpful for companies as they make large investments.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Brantley said he hoped that Georgia could continue to be a leader in electric vehicle production regardless of what happens to the tax credits. “This is a long-term play, we hope to be at it for a long time,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-d376f9b">Other Energy Technologies in Limbo</h2><p>Over the past three years, the federal government has also been supporting a broad array of emerging energy technologies that are less mature, including low-carbon hydrogen fuels that could power trucks, new processes to make cement and steel without emissions, as well as technologies to pull carbon dioxide out of the air.</p><p>Many of these projects could potentially qualify for tax breaks in the Inflation Reduction Act. Others have been supported by billions of dollars in grants and loans from the Department of Energy.</p><p>In Western Minnesota, DG Fuels plans a $5 billion plant to produce aviation fuel from agricultural waste. In Indiana, Heidelberg Materials, a cement maker, wants to capture the carbon dioxide it emits and bury it underground. In Louisiana, a company is planning to make a low-carbon ammonia that could be used for fertilizer.</p><p>New Orleans, which has become a major hub for exporting natural gas, has seen a boom in new industries like carbon capture and hydrogen that could help cut emissions in the future. “We’re becoming very diversified,” said Michael Hecht, president of Greater New Orleans, Inc., the economic development agency for southeast Louisiana.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But as part of the tax bill, House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce committee have proposed ending a tax credit for hydrogen fuels by the end of this year. At the same time, the Trump administration has proposed deep cuts and encouraged widespread layoffs at the Energy Department, which historically has played a leading role in nurturing new technologies.</p><p>The debate in Congress over the future of federal energy spending could affect the direction of entire industries.</p><p>“Other countries are rapidly scaling up investments in green steel, green cement, low-carbon manufacturing,” said Lindsey Baxter Griffith, chief executive of Clean Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization focused on technological innovation in energy. “Without a clear strategy here, we risk falling behind.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Brad Plumer is a Times reporter who covers technology and policy efforts to address global warming.</p></div><div><p>Harry Stevens is a Times reporter and graphics editor covering climate change, energy and the natural world.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Library of Congress Standoff:</strong> The president named Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general and the president’s former personal lawyer, as the acting librarian.
