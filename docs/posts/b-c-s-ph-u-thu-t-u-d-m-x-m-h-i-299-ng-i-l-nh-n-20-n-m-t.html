He was 98.</p><p>His wife, Simone Harari Baulieu, confirmed the death <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7334252465061552128/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a>.</p><p>Dr. Baulieu’s early research focused on hormones, notably DHEA, one of the key hormones in the adrenal gland, as well as groundbreaking work on estrogen and progesterone. But it was his development in the early 1980s of the synthetic steroid RU-486, or mifepristone, that thrust him onto the public stage.</p><p>Unlike the morning-after pill, which is used after sex to delay ovulation, RU-486 works as a kind of “anti-hormone,” in Dr. Baulieu’s words, by blocking the uterus from receiving progesterone, thereby preventing a fertilized egg from implanting.</p><p>Taking the drug with misoprostol, a drug that causes uterine contractions, essentially triggers a miscarriage, enabling women to terminate early pregnancies without surgery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The two-dose treatment has been proved safe and highly effective — with a success rate of about 95 percent — and is commonly used in many countries; in the United States, medication abortions accounted for more than 50 percent of all abortions in 2020. After the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/briefing/abortion-pills.html" title="">demand for the pills surged</a>, and abortion opponents began seeking ways to ban the drug nationwide.</p><p>Controversy over RU-486 began as soon as its release in the 1980s. Dr. Baulieu developed the drug in partnership with the French drug company Roussel-Uclaf, where he was an independent consultant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/30Baulieu--print2/30Baulieu--mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/30Baulieu--print2/30Baulieu--mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/30Baulieu--print2/30Baulieu--mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Wearing a white lab coat, he sits at a table filled with various kinds of medical equipment." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/30Baulieu--print2/30Baulieu--articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/30Baulieu--print2/30Baulieu--articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/30Baulieu--print2/30Baulieu--jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/30Baulieu--print2/30Baulieu--superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9815d9cb-bc3d-5eae-91e7-4178f74ceef1" decoding="async" width="600" height="396"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Baulieu in 1988, the year RU-486 was approved for sale in France.

I have not dedicated my life to abortion. I am not anti-children.” But, he continued, “Women die in botched abortions. Two hundred thousand every year. RU-486 can save them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Baulieu in 1994.

In 1995, he and a team of colleagues published a study that found that the sex hormone progesterone might play a surprising role in fighting certain nerve diseases.</p><p>He also grew increasingly interested in the role of hormones in aging and what he called “the longevity revolution,” with its far-reaching consequences for society.<span>  </span>He was especially interested in how the steroidal hormone DHEA, which he studied early in his career, affects the aging process, and whether supplements might lead to longer, healthier lives.</p><p>“Healthy aging is one of the main goals of humanity,” he <a href="https://charlierose.com/videos/11276" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the television interviewer Charlie Rose in 2007; a year later he created the Institut Baulieu, for him and his team from Inserm, the French national health institute, to study aging issues, including the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.</p><p>“My attitude is that we should work to keep extending life and life expectancy,” he <a href="https://france-amerique.com/i-support-life-and-women-right-to-choose/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the magazine France-Amérique in 2022. “But the most important thing is to preserve optimum brain function in order to live as long as possible in full possession of our faculties.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Étienne-Émile Baulieu was born Étienne Blum on Dec. 12, 1926, in Strasbourg, France, to Jewish parents. His father, Léon Blum, was a doctor specializing in kidney disorders and was one of the first to test insulin in the treatment of diabetes. He died when Étienne-Émile was 3. Soon after, his mother, Thérèse (Lion) Blum, a lawyer and pianist, moved him and his two younger sisters first to Paris and then to a town near Grenoble after the outbreak of World War II.</p><p>Étienne-Émile joined the Communist Party as a teenager, and took the name Émile Baulieu when acquiring false papers after joining the French Resistance. He eventually quit the party in 1956, after the Soviet invasion of Hungary.</p><p>He pursued a medical career: He became a doctor in 1955 after studying at Faculté de Médecine in Paris and received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1963 at Faculté des Sciences in Paris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Baulieu in his office in Paris in 2023.

He was also deeply involved in legalizing birth control in France in 1966 as part of a government committee appointed under President Charles de Gaulle.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>As a young scientist on a fellowship at Columbia University in the 1950s, he met <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/gregory-pincus-1903-1967/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gregory G. Pincus</a>, the inventor of the birth control pill, who became a <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/media/5220526/generation-pilule" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mentor</a> and who inspired Dr. Baulieu to pursue research into contraception and pregnancy regulation.</p><p>His work on contraception began in the 1970s, focusing with his team of Inserm researchers on isolating the receptors within the cells of the uterus that receive progesterone, which signals the uterus to hold onto the fertilized egg. The goal was to find chemical “progesterone impostors” that “would latch onto the receptors and occupy them,” according to the 1989 Times profile, thus preventing impregnation.</p><p>“Rather than disrupt a pregnancy with a sharpened spoon or a suction tube, why couldn’t the natural process be reversed by altering the balance of the same hormone that caused it to begin,” he <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-medicine/emile-baulieu-the-complicated-life-of-the-abortion-pill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked in an interview with</a> Lauren Collins of The New Yorker in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Misoprostol and Mifepristone tablets are used together to provide medication abortions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriela Bhaskar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Clinical tests of RU-486 began in 1982 in Switzerland.

Once, on a visit to the United States, Dr. Baulieu had to travel with a bodyguard.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>He nevertheless lobbied hard for the pill’s acceptance. Despite intense pressure from opponents in France and abroad, the pill eventually gained traction after its initial approval in 1988. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173426/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">formally approved</a> RU-486 in 2000.</p><p>“It is always tragic when politics takes the most vulnerable hostage — in this case, women,’’ Dr. Baulieu told France-Amérique. “I have never been ‘for abortion,’ but rather ‘for the right to abortion.’ I support life and women’s right to choose.”</p><p>He also expressed outrage at the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade. “It’s scandalous,” he told The New Yorker in 2022. The decision, he said, “calls into question a fundamental right of women that we would have thought was legally, politically and morally guaranteed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Baulieu in 2016.
