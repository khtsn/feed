		Zellsis	</a>
</span> might not be as dedicated to his salesmanship of the Sentinels bundle, putting more focus into starting a deep run.</p>

<p>“I didn&#39;t bring a flag this time, though I&#39;ll have some tweets and jokes lined up,” Zellsis said to the press. “The end of Stage 2 isn&#39;t what we wanted at all, but we had a team talk about mentally resetting. For a new tournament, a team just has to be in form for that tournament, and that&#39;s been true for every Valorant major. We should be ready to compete here.”</p>

</span> faced some medical issues. Thankfully, according to his teammate and fellow debutant, he will be fine to play.</p>

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6959/flickless">

</span>. Whichever team finishes higher in the tournament will stay, and that adds a layer of importance to an Ascension team that has been one of the more consistent teams in VCT China 2025.</p>

<p>“Before the end of Stage 2, we didn&#39;t expect this result,” Viva said about their VCT 2026 situation. “We didn&#39;t expect to be fighting for our VCT spot at Champions, but that only means we have to be more locked into every game we play.”</p>

<p>Then, the recent champs spoke up, as <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9801/f0rsaken">
		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span> commented on how Paper Rex feels coming into Champions Paris as the recent Masters winners, as well as how he fits into the roster as the IGL of the most successful chaotic team in Valorant history.</p>

<p>“I don&#39;t think we have much pressure just because we&#39;ve been in plenty of international tournaments; we just need to keep our routine the same, so there won&#39;t be any pressure at all,” f0rsakeN said. “I know I need to do the best as an IGL, to keep the vibes positive by joking around with the team or singing a song.”</p>

<p>Also, all players in Group A brought up that a true wild card in this tournament is DRG, mainly due to <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/26171/demon1">

<p>“I wanted to be able to frag a bit more, but I recently played a scrim with 1 kill, 19 deaths, and we still won,” Boaster said. “I want my teammates to shine, especially with the teammates I have. I want to keep their snowball going and help them to be the players I want them to be.”</p>

<p>“We have improved from the last time, though, as the first seed from China,” whzy said. “I don&#39;t have that much pressure on my shoulders, because no matter the seed, you need to represent VCT CN well.”</p>

<p>“I think the difference between the last Champs appearances and this one for me is the fact that I am IGLing,” nAts said. “Aside from that, the map changes and the adaptation are the biggest differences, as some people won&#39;t be able to adapt.”</p>

<p>Thankfully, nAts did not face the same visa issues for Paris, and Team Liquid will begin Paris with their full roster. </p>

</span>&#39;s updated mindset for Paris, talking about how they don&#39;t see themselves as returning champs after finishing third in China, instead focusing on doing the best they can with pickup <span data-ref-id="28">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span>, alongside having fun in Paris.</p>

<p>“I think all is pretty well, we&#39;re all getting prepared for the matches and going out to eat Chinese here in Paris,” ZmjjKK said. “We are going to adjust based on Jieni7, but we will try and hype him up on stage since it is his first international.”</p>



<p>The final group of the conference hosted plenty of experience, starting with G2 Esports IGL <span data-ref-id="29">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3885/valyn">
		valyn	</a>
</span> speaking about the grind of playing through 2025 with the worry of falling out of VCT as an Ascension team, and how it pushed them to success.</p>

<p>“Being an Ascension team, we have to make Champs or be better than the other [regional Ascension team] to keep our spot,” valyn said. “You always have to chase something, which removes complacency. It was a big goal to avoid that happening, with no other option, so it kept us motivated. Now, the next goal is to win Champs.”</p>

<p>He also spoke about genuinely not expecting <span data-ref-id="30">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> to return so soon, as the team had prepared to play Champions with <span data-ref-id="31">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2170/babybay">
		BABYBAY	</a>
</span> in the roster. Now, with leaf back, G2 looks like a frontrunner to make the finals once again. Yet, looking across the table, their first opponents in Paris not only have a recent trophy under their belt, but a chip on their shoulder after a disappointing end to Stage 2.</p>

<p>“It&#39;s been a long year for us with the trip to EWC, with plenty of opportunity for a fall off,” <span data-ref-id="32">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29873/benjyfishy">

</span> had <span data-ref-id="35">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> speak, and the first thing that was brought up was not only their drop off in form since winning Masters Bangkok, but their pickup of <span data-ref-id="36">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/43057/dh">
		DH	</a>
</span> helping right the ship.</p>

<p>“Things were very different from Kickoff to Stage 1,” BuZz said. “We thought we were up to date, if not ahead of the meta, but as the stage went on, we lost that advantage. Since DH joined us, the vibe has become more positive, and he has exceeded our expectations.”</p>

<p>Last but not least, DRG and representative <span data-ref-id="37">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11524/nicc">
		Nicc	</a>
</span> spoke not only about their long-awaited return to international play, but also about their substitute Demon1 filling in.</p>

<p>“[Demon1] brought us a different feeling to the team than what vo0kashu brings,” Nicc said. “Being a world champion, his comprehension and thoughts on the game could lead us far in the tournament.”</p>

<p>Nicc and vo0kashu were the only members of the DRG team that made it to Masters Shanghai, meaning, depending on whether vo0kashu can make it to Paris, he is the only one who could learn from that experience to teach his team outside of new addition Demon1. He spoke on that experience, focusing on improvement above all else.</p>

<p>“I&#39;ve matured from the last time I was at an international, and I&#39;m honored to play against other strong teams across other regions in VCT,” Nicc said. “We need to keep enhancing ourselves and keep improving.”</p>
