    <h1>Harris Opens $110 Million Cash Edge Over Trump After August Fund-Raising Haul</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Biden also had a wide lead in cash on hand over Mr. Trump much of the campaign, but Mr. Trump closed the gap shortly after securing the Republican nomination this spring. The Democrats, catapulted by enthusiasm after the top-of-the-ticket switch, were able to rebuild the lead.</p><p>Campaigns typically spend down their cash as Election Day nears — pouring remaining cash into final ads or get-out-the-vote efforts.</p><p>What’s more, Mr. Trump’s fund-raising has shown signs of struggle: Campaigns typically raise successively more in each month before an election, but his August number ($130 million) was less than what was raised in July ($139 million). That August number was also much lower than his August 2020 haul ($210 million).</p><p>Mr. Trump has not held many campaign fund-raising events as of late, mostly delegating the reception-and-dinner circuit to his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio. Mr. Trump is scheduled next week, after his much-awaited debate with Ms. Harris, to headline three fund-raisers, according to copies of invitations viewed by The New York Times. One is planned in Salt Lake City, one in Los Angeles, and another in Silicon Valley hosted by Thomas M. Siebel, a billionaire entrepreneur.</p><p>Ms. Harris’s August fund-raising haul is almost identical to the $364 million raised in August 2020 by Mr. Biden’s campaign.</p></div></div>
