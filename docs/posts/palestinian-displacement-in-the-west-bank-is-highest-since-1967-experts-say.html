Palestinians fear it is a veiled attempt to permanently displace Palestinians from their homes and exert greater control over areas administered by the Palestinian Authority, a semiautonomous body that has also battled the militants in recent months.</p><p>Many of the displaced are the descendants of refugees who were expelled or fled from their homes during the wars surrounding the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, a period known in Arabic as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/opinion/18khoury.html" title="">the Nakba</a>. The renewed displacement, even if temporary, raises painful memories of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/01/magazine/israel-founding-palestinian-conflict.html" title="">central trauma in Palestinian history</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While roughly 3,000 have returned home, most remain homeless after more than three weeks — a bigger displacement than during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/21/world/mideast-turmoil-aftermath-rubble-refugee-camp-bitter-lessons-for-2-enemies.html" title="">a similar Israeli campaign in the West Bank</a> in 2002, according to two Palestinian and two Israeli experts on the history of the West Bank. That year, troops raided several cities at the height of a Palestinian uprising, known as the second intifada, which began with protests before leading to a surge in Palestinian attacks on civilians in Israel.</p><p>The current numbers also dwarf the displacement during intra-Palestinian clashes earlier this year, when up to 1,000 residents of Jenin left their homes, according to a residents’ leadership council there. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Israeli troops outside military vehicles in the West Bank." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt/00WestBank-Displacement-03-wmjt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/74102901-ed35-517f-8bd7-178e8a780ba2" decoding="async" width="600" height="382"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli troops in the Nur Shams refugee camp, near the West Bank city of Tulkarem.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alaa Badarneh/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of the Al-Far’a Camp in the West Bank evacuating their homes as the Israeli military continued its operations in the area this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Majdi Mohammed/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As in 2002, some of those displaced during this new campaign will have no home to return to. The Israeli military has demolished scores of buildings in the areas it has invaded, ripping up roads, water pipes and power lines to destroy what it says are booby traps set by militants. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said that water and sanitation systems had been destroyed in four dense urban neighborhoods, known as refugee camps because they house people displaced in 1948 and their descendants. It added that some water infrastructure had been contaminated with sewage.</p><p>“We’ve reached a point where the refugee camps are out of order,” said Hakeem Abu Safiye, who oversees emergency services in Tulkarem camp. “They are uninhabitable. Even if the army pulls out, we are not sure what will be left to repair.”</p><p>The full scale of the damage is unclear because the military is still operating in most of the areas it has invaded, but the United Nations has already recorded severe damage to more than 150 homes in Jenin. By early February, the Israeli military had acknowledged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-raid.html" title="">blowing up at least 23 buildings</a>, but it has declined to confirm the latest number of demolished structures.</p><p>“The soldiers are taking over one area after another, destroying homes, infrastructure and roads,” said Ramy Abu Siriye, 53, a barber forced to flee his home in Tulkarem on Jan. 27, the first day of the Israeli operation there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The Israelis have two objectives — first, to push refugees from the northern West Bank toward the central areas, aiming to erase the refugee camps entirely,” Mr. Abu Siriye said. “The second goal is to eliminate resistance and weaken the Palestinian Authority’s ability to govern,” Mr. Abu Siriye added.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Israeli military has acknowledged blowing up at least 23 buildings, but declined on Friday to provide a full list of demolished structures.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People inspect the rubble of a house where two Palestinian militants were killed during an Israeli raid in Burqin village, near Jenin, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">-/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said the military’s goal was to root out militant groups, including Hamas, that launch terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians.</p><p>“The purpose of the operations is to prevent terror from places a few kilometers from Jewish communities and to prevent a repeat of Oct. 7,” Colonel Shoshani said, referring to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/22/world/europe/beeri-massacre.html" title="">the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/world/middleeast/israel-music-festival-massacre.html" title="">killed</a> up to 1,200 people and led to the abduction of some 250 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/middleeast/hamas-hostage-sexual-assault.html" title="">hostages</a>.</p><p>Colonel Shoshani acknowledged that in some cases people had been ordered to leave specific buildings close to what he said were militant hideouts. But more generally, Colonel Shoshani denied any wider policy of “forced evacuation or displacement of Palestinians,” he said. “If people want to move around, they are obviously allowed to,” he added. Roughly 3,000 people have been able to return to al-Faraa camp, near Tubas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But displaced Palestinians said that in both Jenin and Tulkarem they were instructed to leave by soldiers who used loudspeakers to make general evacuation orders.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“We had to leave the camp — the army threatened to shoot at us,” said Aws Khader, 29, a supermarket owner who fled Tulkarem on Jan. 27. “They used megaphones, ordering people to leave or be shot,” Mr. Khader added.</p><p>Asked for comment on this and similar incidents, the military repeated in a statement that no evacuation orders had been issued, but that all those who wished to leave had been provided with safe passage. The statement said that troops operated in Mr. Khader’s neighborhood because they had “uncovered terror infrastructure and weapons that terrorists had hidden in a bookstore.”</p><p>Palestinians dismiss the military’s explanations, citing calls by key ministers in Israel’s far-right government to encourage the flight of Palestinians from the West Bank, destroy the Palestinian Authority and annex the territory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Israel captured the West Bank in 1967 from Jordan, expelling Palestinians from several villages close to Israel and prompting the flight of hundreds of thousands of others into Jordan. Since then, Israel has gradually entrenched its control, building hundreds of settlements, often on private Palestinian land, for hundreds of thousands of Israeli civilians, and building a two-tier legal structure that critics have described as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/world/middleeast/israel-apartheid-palestinians-hrw.html" title="">an apartheid system</a>.
