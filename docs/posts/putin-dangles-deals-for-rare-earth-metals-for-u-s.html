Putin on Monday said American companies could do lucrative business deals in Russia and even help mine rare earths in Russian-occupied Ukraine, further amplifying the Kremlin’s message to President Trump that there was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-russia-ukraine-putin-trump.html" title="">money to be made from a better relationship with Moscow</a>.</p><p>Mr. Putin, in an interview with Russian state television that was released late Monday, said that Russia had an “order of magnitude” more rare earth metals than Ukraine and that Moscow was “ready to work with our foreign partners, including the Americans,” in developing those deposits.</p><p>He said the invitation applied to Russian-occupied Ukraine as well, adding that American companies could also “make good money” by helping to develop aluminum production in Siberia.</p><p>“There is something to think about here,” Mr. Putin said, referring to aluminum, “as well as about joint work on rare earth metals and in other areas, for example, energy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The interview showed Mr. Putin working hard to appeal to Mr. Trump’s interest in profits and deal-making. It came as Mr. Trump has swung American foreign policy in Mr. Putin’s favor at dizzying speed, as underscored by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/middleeast/us-un-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">the United States siding with Russia</a> in votes at the United Nations on Monday about the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Trump has been pressuring Ukraine to agree to grant the United States a share of its revenues from mining rare earth metals and other natural resources. The two sides were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/europe/ukraine-us-mineral-wealth-deal.html" title="">closing in on such an agreement</a> on Monday.</p><p>Mr. Putin praised Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/asia/china-trump-nuclear-military.html" title="">recent comments about a potential deal</a> in which the United States, Russia and China would halve their defense budgets.</p><p>“It seems to me that the idea is good: The United States would reduce by 50 percent, and we would reduce by 50 percent, and the People’s Republic of China would then join in if it wants,” Mr. Putin said. “We think that the proposal is good and are ready for discussions on this matter.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But the interview also showed that Mr. Putin appears to be in far less of a hurry than Mr. Trump to end the war in Ukraine. Russia continues to slowly gain ground on the battlefield, while Ukraine struggles with a dearth of personnel and uncertainty about the future of American support.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Kostiantynivka, an industrial city in eastern Ukraine, on Monday.

Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s top military commander for the first two years of the war, who is now ambassador to London.</p><p>Mr. Putin said General Zaluzhny was twice as popular as Mr. Zelensky inside Ukraine, without providing a source for his figures. Polling does show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-trump.html" title="">Mr. Zelensky trailing General Zaluzhny in a hypothetical presidential election</a>, but by much narrower margins.</p><p>Mr. Putin said Mr. Zelensky would have “absolutely no chance of winning the elections” against General Zaluzhny. Mr. Putin referred to the general as “Mr. Zaluzhny,” a notable courtesy given that Mr. Putin almost never uses Mr. Zelensky’s name in public.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
