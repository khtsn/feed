He insisted that the tariffs would not fuel inflation and suggested that he would move ahead with them regardless of any last-minute concessions from the other nations.</p><p>Mr. Trump is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and had no public events listed on his schedule on Saturday.</p><p>The president is expected to eventually sign an executive order putting the tariffs into effect and could do so retroactively.

He used that time to impose a $2 million fine on a money transmitter and release reports on auto lending costs, specialty credit reporting companies and rent payment data.</p><p>When Congress created the consumer bureau in 2011, it included guardrails to protect the agency’s independence and shield it from shifting political tides. But the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the president was free to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/cfpb-supreme-court.html" title="">fire the agency’s director</a> without cause, which cleared the way for the bureau’s leadership to change with each presidential administration.</p><p>Mr. Chopra was a scourge of Wall Street, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/business/rohit-chopra-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-wallstreet.html" title="">known for his aggressive approach</a> to enforcing consumer protection laws and expanding their boundaries by issuing new rules. He led a crackdown that prompted most large banks to abandon or significantly reduce overdraft fees, and he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/business/wells-fargo-consumer-loans-fine.html" title="">ordered Wells Fargo to pay $2 billion</a> in 2022 to customers harmed by its misdeeds, which included improperly seizing some borrowers’ cars and homes.</p><p>Mr. Chopra was especially focused on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/us/politics/cfpb-republicans-rohit-chopra.html" title="">tightening the rules</a> governing large technology companies’ consumer payment services and use of customer data, an effort that drew praise from banking trade groups. But those groups fiercely opposed many of his other actions, often tying them up in years of litigation.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/briefing/biden-junk-fees.html" title="">a Biden administration crusade against “junk fees,”</a> Mr. Chopra issued a rule last year to limit most credit card late payment fees to no more than $8 per month. Banking trade groups sued and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/credit-card-fee-limit-blocked.html" title="">won an injunction</a> temporarily blocking it. The consumer bureau has fought the lawsuit, but a new director could choose to end that opposition and curtail or abandon the rule.</p><p>During President Trump’s first term, he installed an acting bureau director — Mick Mulvaney, who later served as his acting chief of staff — who sought to cut off the agency’s funding and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/magazine/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-trump.html" title="">cripple its enforcement efforts</a>. He was succeeded by Kathleen Kraninger, who issued rules that gutted Obama-era regulations, including one that would have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/payday-loans-rules-cfpb.html" title="">sharply curtailed payday lending</a>. Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. <a href="https://x.com/CFPBKraninger/status/1351949184883163138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ousted Ms. Kraninger</a> immediately upon taking office.</p><p>The bureau will be run by Zixta Martinez, its deputy director, until Mr. Trump chooses a new acting leader. Financial industry officials expect the agency to pare back its oversight, issue fewer new regulations and freeze or rescind some of those imposed by Mr. Chopra.</p><p>He used his departure letter, addressed to Mr. Trump, to pitch the bureau as a prospective partner in enacting consumer protections the president has spoken of endorsing. On the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Trump said he would temporarily limit credit card interest rates to 10 percent.</p><p>“We also have analyzed your promising proposal on capping credit card interest rates, and we see a path for enacting meaningful reforms,” Mr. Chopra wrote.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2QxM2ZhZGQxLTI3ZTQtNWJhMS1hZmM5LWUyOWVhMWIyMTc1Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/trump-tariffs-news#trumps-tariffs-us-mexico" data-source-id="100000009958102"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-swanson"><img alt="Ana Swanson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/10/multimedia/author-ana-swanson/author-ana-swanson-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/10/multimedia/author-ana-swanson/author-ana-swanson-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/10/multimedia/author-ana-swanson/author-ana-swanson-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/simon-romero"><img alt="Simon Romero" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/13/reader-center/author-simon-romero/author-simon-romero-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/13/reader-center/author-simon-romero/author-simon-romero-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/13/reader-center/author-simon-romero/author-simon-romero-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-01T11:00:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 1, 2025, 6:00 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trucks passing through a toll on the World Trade Bridge in Laredo, Texas, home to America’s busiest port.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carter Johnston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>When Dennis Nixon started working at a regional bank in Laredo, Texas, in 1975, there was just a trickle of trade across the border with Mexico. Now, nearly a billion dollars of commerce and more than 15,000 trucks roll over the line every day just a quarter mile from his office, binding the economies of the United States and Mexico together.</p><p>Laredo is America’s busiest port, and a conduit for car parts, gasoline, avocados and computers. “You cannot pick it apart anymore,” Mr. Nixon said of the U.S. and Mexican economies. Thirty years of economic integration under a free trade deal has created “interdependencies and relationships that you don’t always understand and measure, until something goes wrong,” he said.</p><div><p>Now that something is looming: 25 percent tariffs on Mexican products, which President Trump plans to impose on Saturday as he looks to pressure the Mexican government to do more to curb illegal immigration. Mr. Trump is also expected to hit Canada with 25 percent levies and impose a 10 percent tax on Chinese imports.</p><p>A longtime proponent of tariffs and a critic of free trade deals, Mr. Trump seems unafraid to upend America’s closest economic relationships. He is focusing on strengthening the border against illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl, two areas that he spoke about often during his 2024 campaign.</p><p>But the president has other beefs with Mexico, including the economic competition it poses for U.S. workers. The president and his supporters believe that imports of cars and steel from Mexico are weakening U.S. manufacturers. And they say the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal Mr. Trump signed in 2020 to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, needs to be updated — or perhaps, in some minds, scrapped.</p><p>Many businesses say ties between the countries run deeper than most Americans realize, and policies like tariffs that seek to sever them would be painful. Of all the world’s major economic partners, the United States and Mexico are among the most integrated — linked by business, trade, tourism, familial ties, remittances and culture. It’s a closeness that at times generates discontent and efforts to distance the relationship, but also brings many benefits.</p><p>“Our countries have a symbiotic relationship,” said Juan Carlos Rodríguez, managing director in Tijuana for Cushman &amp; Wakefield, one of the world’s biggest commercial real estate companies.</p><p>“Our economies are so intertwined that it would take decades to decouple,” Mr. Rodríguez said. “Such a scenario would have a catastrophic impact on Mexico.”</p><h3 id="link-6fab0b81"><span>A natural partner</span></h3><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rail yard in Salinas Victoria, Mexico.

For many Americans, that trade pact is now synonymous with offshoring and decimated factory towns. But <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/82/1/1/1547758?redirectedFrom=fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">economists calculate</a> that many parts of the United States benefited as the agreement increased trade and economic activity.</p><p>Other parts of the United States were severely hurt as manufacturers moved to Mexico in search of cheaper labor. As factory towns hollowed out, that ended up fueling a trade backlash, helping pave the way for anti-trade candidates like Mr. Trump to win office.</p><p>In an interview, Peter Navarro, the president’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, called NAFTA a “catastrophe” and bad for both Mexico and the United States.</p><p>“The fact of the matter is China was so much worse that people tend to forget how bad NAFTA was,” he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs.html" title="">In his first term</a>, Mr. Trump threatened tariffs on Mexico over border issues, but instead settled for a deal. He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/us/politics/trump-withdraw-nafta.html" title="">repeatedly threatened</a> to withdraw from NAFTA, but instead decided to renegotiate it. His advisers added provisions to the pact they believed would bolster U.S. steel and auto manufacturing, but some now say they have fallen short.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump was last in the White House, Mexico’s importance to the U.S. economy has grown. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and started a “nearshoring” boom.</p><p>Companies were already looking to move out of China, to avoid tariffs Mr. Trump imposed there, as well as rising costs and political risk. Manufacturers rushed to open plants in Mexico, seizing on the country’s low-cost industrial base and proximity to the United States.</p><p>Those changes helped make Mexico the United States’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/business/economy/united-states-china-mexico-trade.html" title="">top trading partner in goods</a> in 2023. As trade between the countries has expanded, so has the bilateral trade deficit with Mexico, a metric that Mr. Trump is particularly focused on.</p><p>American consumers may be as reliant on foreign products as ever. But economists argue that imports from Mexico can have quite different implications for the U.S. economy than imports from China.</p><p>That’s because there are many integrated supply chains that run back and forth across North American borders. Goods like cars, electronics and bluejeans are volleyed back and forth among the United States, Mexico and Canada as they are turned from raw materials into parts and then final products.</p><p>According to economists at S&amp;P Global, of the imports coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico, more than 18 percent of their value was created in the United States, before being sent to those countries. That’s far more than the proportion for other countries, and a sign of how closely the economies are integrated.</p><p>Proximity creates other benefits: Research by the <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/speeches-leaders/2024/240412coronado" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</a> has found that a 10 percent increase in factory output in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, leads to a 2.8 increase in total employment in El Paso, Texas, concentrated in areas like transportation, retail and real estate.</p><p>“There’s this perception that the border is all about walls and illegal crossings,” said Diego Solórzano, the founder of Desteia, which helps companies making supply chain decisions. “This line in the sand is actually the most powerful economic corridor on Earth.”</p><p>Roughly $800 billion worth of goods were transported across the border last year, Mr. Solórzano said, an amount that would position the U.S.-Mexico border in striking distance of the world’s 20 largest economies.</p><p>The two economies rely on each other for their energy needs. Mexico, which <a href="https://mexicobusiness.news/oilandgas/news/us-mexico-energy-interdependence-safeguard-against-tariffs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">depends</a> on the United States for an estimated 70 percent of its natural gas consumption, is more vulnerable to any disruptions.</p><p>But the United States also imports about 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Mexico. Imposing import taxes on such cargoes could produce increases in fuel prices, particularly diesel, energy analysts warn.</p><p>Food production is also closely integrated. Mexico supplies roughly half of America’s fresh fruit and vegetables, and that proportion <a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/canada-is-the-top-export-market-for-36-u-s-states-and-mexico-for-six/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rises in winter months</a>. Mexico also emerged last year as the top market for American agricultural exports, totaling $30 billion.</p><p>Bob Hemesath, a fifth-generation farmer in northeastern Iowa, said that Mexico was the biggest buyer of American corn and also a big purchaser of hogs, both of which he produces.</p><p>Tariffs would “put an added cost on a product that doesn’t need to be there, and it’ll drive those countries to go look somewhere else,” Mr. Hemesath said. He spoke by phone from his farm on an unseasonably warm day, where he had just finished power-washing a hog facility.</p><p>“It puts me as a farmer at an economic disadvantage,” he said. “Although I understand wanting to use tariffs as a negotiating tool, what harm do you do?”</p><p>Some Trump officials think corn exports haven’t been entirely benign. Mr. Navarro said that NAFTA had kick-started America’s illegal immigration problem, because when the United States began exporting corn to Mexico after the trade pact took effect, that put Mexican agricultural workers out of jobs, sending some of them into the United States.</p><p>“That’s where that began, our illegal immigration problem,” he said.</p><h3 id="link-5932bd0"><span>Trade irritants</span></h3><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Edgar Thomson Steel Works in Braddock, Pa.

Some argue that Mexico has violated the terms of an agreement it made to limit its steel exports to the United States. They say Mexican shipments of steel to the United States have exceeded the levels set by that agreement, which was signed alongside the U.S.M.C.A.</p><p>(The Mexican steel industry has its own complaints. On Tuesday, Canacero, a Mexican steel organization, claimed in a statement that it had seen a significant surge in exports of finished steel products from the United States that did not comply with the agreement.)</p><p>There are also growing concerns about Mexico’s trade with China, particularly in the auto sector. Chinese car exports to Mexico have soared, and some Chinese car companies have been scouting for Mexican factory sites.</p><p>That has fueled concerns that Chinese companies will use Mexico as a jumping off point to export to the U.S. market at much lower tariff rates than if they were shipping goods from China.</p><p>Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that Mexico’s role as a conduit for Chinese goods to the United States had been overstated, but that “there absolutely is an issue in the autos sector.” One out of three cars sold in Mexico last year came from China, he said. That means Chinese exports are now meeting Mexican demand for cars, rather than exports from the United States, a blow to the U.S. auto industry.</p><p>Other business owners argue that the United States and Mexico should work together to limit imports from China — but say that doesn’t call for high tariffs on Mexican products.</p><p>Greg Owens, the chief executive of Sherrill Manufacturing, a flatware manufacturer in Sherrill, N.Y., said he would like to see tariffs structured in a way that inhibits China from using Mexico as a back door to the United States. But he opposes putting tariffs on Mexico outright, saying China is a much larger threat.</p><p>“China packing up a flatware factory in Guangzhou, setting up shop in Mexico just to circumvent tariffs — that needs to be dealt with,” he said. “But you can’t destroy your trade relationship with Mexico.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FiZGFhYzAyLWZkMzEtNTllYy1hY2ExLTEzNzkyM2ZmZWNlMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/trump-tariffs-news#us-prisoners-venezuela" data-source-id="100000009963684"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/genevieve-glatsky"><img alt="Genevieve Glatsky" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/29/arts/author-genevieve-glatsky/author-genevieve-glatsky-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/29/arts/author-genevieve-glatsky/author-genevieve-glatsky-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/29/arts/author-genevieve-glatsky/author-genevieve-glatsky-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-01T02:11:46.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 31, 2025, 9:11 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, right, with Richard Grenell, President Trump’s envoy for special missions, at the presidential palace in Caracas on Friday in a photo released by Venezuela’s presidential press office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Miraflores, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Richard Grenell, President Trump’s envoy for special missions, <a href="https://x.com/richardgrenell/status/1885482064050610536?s=46&amp;t=Dt8l1DTe6nujzpeUfp-kZA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that he was flying home from Venezuela with six American detainees on Friday, after meeting with the country’s president.</p><p>There were at least nine people with U.S. citizenship or residency detained in Venezuela, according to Venezuelan officials.

He had entered Venezuela from Colombia to visit friends, Ms. Macias said.</p><p>Mr. Maduro, an autocrat whose country has seen an extraordinary exodus in recent years, has become increasingly isolated on the global stage, accused of having stolen the last presidential election in July. The United States has recognized the opposition candidate as the legitimate winner.</p><p>After the disputed elections, Mr. Maduro started rounding up foreign prisoners, a move that former U.S. diplomats and analysts said they saw as seeking bargaining chips to use with other nations.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s foreign policy team includes many aides <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/marco-rubio-trump-secretary-of-state.html" title="">who support taking a hard line</a> against Mr. Maduro, and policy experts said the Venezuelan leader most likely feared that Washington would take a tougher stance, including potentially imposing more economic sanctions.</p><p>Mr. Maduro, who has spent his entire tenure blaming Venezuela’s economic woes on U.S. imperialism, talked about starting a new era of engagement with the United States in televised remarks on Friday. He did not directly refer to the released Americans.</p><p>“We are starting a new beginning of historical relations where what needs to be done will be done and what needs to be rectified will be rectified,” he said. “We love and admire the people of the United States.”</p><p>Mr. Maduro also referred to his meeting with Mr. Grenell as “frank, direct, open and positive” and said: “We are not anti-American nor have we ever been anti-American. We are anti-imperialist, which is different.”</p><p>But Mauricio Claver-Carone, the U.S. special envoy for Latin America, said in a call with journalists on Friday morning that Mr. Grenell would not make any concessions in exchange for releasing American detainees.</p><p>“This is not a quid pro quo,” he said. “It’s not a negotiation in exchange for anything.” He urged the Maduro government to “heed” to Mr. Grenell’s demands “because ultimately there will be consequences otherwise.”</p><p>Julie Turkewitz<!-- --> contributed reporting from Santander, Colombia.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFlYmFjMzlkLWI2ZGUtNWQwYi04NzJlLTI4MzY4ZWYyYWE2Zg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/trump-tariffs-news#trump-federal-labor-contracts" data-source-id="100000009963466"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/noam-scheiber"><img alt="Noam Scheiber" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/multimedia/author-noam-scheiber/author-noam-scheiber-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/multimedia/author-noam-scheiber/author-noam-scheiber-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/16/multimedia/author-noam-scheiber/author-noam-scheiber-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rebecca-davis-obrien"><img alt="Rebecca Davis O’Brien" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/27/nyregion/author-rebecca-davis-obrien/author-rebecca-davis-obrien-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/27/nyregion/author-rebecca-davis-obrien/author-rebecca-davis-obrien-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/27/nyregion/author-rebecca-davis-obrien/author-rebecca-davis-obrien-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-01T01:05:28.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 31, 2025, 8:05 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump issued a memo invalidating federal labor contracts completed in the last 30 days before a presidential inauguration because they “are purposefully designed to circumvent the will of the people.” </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In the latest effort to put his stamp on the federal work force, President Trump on Friday issued a memorandum invalidating government labor contracts finalized in the last 30 days before a presidential inauguration.</p><p>The policy applies to certain contracts negotiated toward the end of the Biden administration, the memo says. Such “last-minute, lame-duck” agreements, it states, “are purposefully designed to circumvent the will of the people” and “inhibit the President’s authority to manage the executive branch.”</p><div><p>Unions at several agencies rushed to negotiate collective bargaining agreements ahead of Mr. Trump’s inauguration to preserve some practices of the previous administration, like remote work, and insulate them from changes that could make it easier to fire civil servants.</p><p>The memo appears to allude to such practices, which it calls “inefficient and ineffective,” and cites an agreement with the Education Department that attempts to preserve remote work arrangements. The memo says the agreements could be undone if they have not yet been approved by an “applicable” agency head.</p><p>Other agencies, like the Social Security Administration, approved new collective bargaining agreements outside the 30-day window, presumably leaving them unaffected by the memo.</p><p>It was unclear if the memo would survive legal pushback initiated by federal employee unions, though it appeared to anticipate legal challenges, noting that it should remain in force if a portion alluding to prohibited bargaining agreements from the Biden administration is found to be invalid.</p><p>“Federal employees should know that approved union contracts are enforceable by law, and the president does not have the authority to make unilateral changes to those agreements,” Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement. “Members will not be intimidated.

Biden Jr., the government waged a “systematic campaign against its perceived political opponents,” including by deploying law enforcement to pursue its rivals, he said.</p><p>The memo also demands the names of agents who worked on a case against Hamas leadership, though it is not clear why it was added to the list of agents under scrutiny. Prosecutors and agents had disagreed about the merits of the case.</p><p>The office of the deputy attorney general “will commence a review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary” against those F.B.I. agents, analysts and staff, according to the memo, which was addressed to Brian Driscoll, the acting F.B.I. director.</p><p>In an email to F.B.I. employees Friday night, Mr. Driscoll noted that he was among the agents who would be on such a list. The F.B.I. has been told to submit the list of names by Tuesday.</p><p>“We understand that this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts,” Mr. Driscoll wrote, who added that he and his deputy “are going to follow the law, follow F.B.I. policy and do what’s in the best interest of the work force and the American people — always.”</p><p>Later, the F.B.I.’s counterterrorism division sent an email to field offices around the country with instructions about filling a database with bureau personnel who worked on the cases — a number likely to be about 6,000.</p><p>People familiar with the internal discussions said that some Trump administration officials are moving to force scores, or possibly hundreds, of agents out of the F.B.I. in the coming days and weeks. Officials have discussed notifying a large number of agents that they face possible termination, demotion or transfer.</p><p>At the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, more than a dozen prosecutors who had worked on Jan. 6-related cases were told that they were being terminated, according to people familiar with the notices.</p><p>Those informed of their dismissals had been hired as the office struggled to manage what became the largest prosecution in the department’s history.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bove told the acting leadership of the F.B.I. to compile a list of all agents and staff members who worked on “investigations and/or prosecutions” relating to the Capitol riot.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rod Lamkey Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In another memo, Mr. Bove said the prosecutors in question had been short-term hires that were improperly made permanent staff during the Biden administration. “I will not tolerate subversive personnel actions,” he wrote.</p><p>Mr. Bove offered no evidence those targeted had done anything improper, illegal or unethical. Instead, he cited a legal technicality and questioned whether those targeted would allow the U.S. attorney’s office to “faithfully implement the agenda that the American people elected President Trump to execute.”</p><p>The moves come just one day after Kash Patel, Mr. Trump’s pick to lead the F.B.I., testified before Congress that the bureau would not be targeted for political reasons.</p><p>“All F.B.I. employees will be protected against political retribution,” Mr. Patel said during his confirmation hearing on Thursday.</p><p>Around the time that Mr. Patel appeared before the committee, a handful of senior F.B.I. employees were informed that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/trump-fbi-firing.html" title="">they needed to resign</a> in a matter of days or be fired, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to shake up the agency’s upper ranks.</p><p>The moves are highly unusual in part because they are happening before a director has been confirmed to take charge of the bureau. The timing of these moves — made while the nominations of Mr. Patel and Pam Bondi for attorney general are still pending — could lessen the blowback for them — or it could jeopardize their support among Republican senators.</p><p>A department spokesman, and Mr. Patel’s representative, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. F.B.I. officials declined to comment. The people familiar with the planning spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.</p><p>In a statement, the F.B.I. Agents Association said that if true, “these outrageous actions by acting officials are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump.”</p><p>“Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats,” the statement continued.</p><p>If the administration follows through, it would be a singular moment in the F.B.I.’s history, and fly in the face of decades worth of civil service laws that are meant to protect the integrity and professionalism of the government work force.</p><p>Mr. Patel, speaking under oath, also promised to follow established bureau procedures in seeking terminations or transfers, including referring accusations of improper conduct by prosecutors to the Justice Department’s inspector general before taking action.</p><p>F.B.I. officials were already bracing for swift changes, but the forced retirements and the dismissal of senior agents in the field and at headquarters this week has led to immense unease. Agents are worried that they will be fired for investigations that angered Mr. Trump — especially those who worked on squads at the Washington field office on the criminal inquiry into Mr. Trump’s handling of classified documents as well as the inquiry into a fake electors’ scheme.</p><p>Two of the senior agents who ran field offices in Miami and Las Vegas and were forced out had been criticized by former agents with ties to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/kash-patel-charity.html" title="">Mr. Patel’s foundation</a>, a nonprofit that Mr. Patel has said gives aid to a range of recipients, including the families of those charged in the Jan. 6 riot.</p><p>Some F.B.I. personnel expressed frustration that the bureau’s leadership provided little guidance as rumors circulated widely about firings and about colleagues being escorted out of field offices. Mr. Driscoll’s email Friday night ended some of that confusion, though it confirmed some of their deepest fears.</p><p>Jason Manning, a former federal prosecutor who worked on Jan. 6 cases, warned of the consequences.</p><p>“It will mean firing agents who investigate child sex crimes, violent crimes, immigration crimes, Chinese espionage and lots of other criminal activity that President Trump claims to care about,” he said. “Our country is significantly weaker and more dangerous because of this.”</p><p>The disarray in the bureau <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was also evident on its website</a>, which notably omitted the name of the acting director, Mr. Driscoll. Inside the bureau, one person said that the atmosphere was sullen and that employees were startled by what was unfolding as top F.B.I. officials scrambled to complete the required retirement paperwork, with the agents turning in their badges.</p><p>Mr. Driscoll and Robert C. Kissane, his acting deputy, said goodbye to their colleagues.</p><p>In an interview, Democratic lawmakers denounced the moves.</p><p>“They are hollowing out our professional law enforcement community,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a Democrat who questioned Mr. Patel at the confirmation hearing. “It is the absolute height of arrogance to be doing exactly what their F.B.I. nominee promised not to do.”</p><p>Retribution has been swift at the Justice Department as about a dozen prosecutors who worked on the two criminal investigations into Mr. Trump for the special counsel Jack Smith were fired.</p><p>Mr. Trump once called the Jan. 6 riot a “heinous attack,” but in one of his first official acts, he granted sweeping clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the assault. He issued pardons to most of the defendants and commuted the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia, most of whom were convicted of seditious conspiracy.</p><p>During Mr. Patel’s testimony on Thursday, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, told Mr. Patel that lawmakers would hold him accountable if he tried to exact revenge at the F.B.I., saying two wrongs did not make a right.</p><p>“And there have been and may still be some bad people there, and you’ve got to find out who the bad people are and get rid of them, in accordance with due process and the rule of law,” Mr. Kennedy said. “And then you’ve got to lift up the good people. Don’t go over there and burn that place down. Go over there and make it better.”</p><p>The F.B.I. has been in turmoil since Christopher A. Wray, the former director, stepped down before Mr. Trump took office. After Mr. Wray’s deputy abruptly resigned and shortly after Mr. Trump took office, the administration identified the wrong agent as acting director.</p><p>Instead of correcting the error, officials kept it in the hope that a new director would be quickly confirmed, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/fbi-overhaul-off-to-a-rocky-start-as-kash-patel-prepares-to-defend-his-vision-1085c6f8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal earlier reported</a>.</p><p>Mr. Kissane, who had been the top counterterrorism agent in New York, had been widely believed to be in line to be acting director, several current and former agents said, with Mr. Driscoll, a decorated agent in the F.B.I.’s New York field office as the No. 2.

Canada and Mexico together account for 30 percent of U.S. trade. Many industries could be saddled with extra costs, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/canada/trump-tariffs-windsor-autos.html" title="">the vast auto operations</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/business/general-motors-trump-mexico-canada-tariffs.html" title="">straddle</a> the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>Mr. Trump could withdraw his threat or reduce the tariff if he decides Canada and Mexico are doing more to address his complaints, Howard Lutnick, the president’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-commerce-chief-pick-lutnick-says-he-prefers-across-the-board-tariffs-by-2025-01-29/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>With the tariff deadline near, some data shows higher freight volumes on road and rail, but the increases are not especially large, and transportation experts say rail and trucking companies have the capacity to cope. The situation, they said, is quite different from 2021 and 2022, when a deluge of imports overwhelmed supply chains, causing shipping costs to skyrocket and helping fuel a rapid acceleration of inflation.</p><p>“The industry’s probably never been in a better spot to deal with significant changes in the marketplace,” said Scott Shannon, vice president of North America cross-border at C.H. Robinson, a freight forwarder.</p><p>Larry Gross, president of Gross Transportation Consulting, said the transportation of shipping containers by rail was up 10 percent in the first four weeks of the year across North America compared with the same period in 2024. But while efforts to bring in goods before tariffs very likely contributed to the increase, he said, other factors also played a role. A big one was a desire to get shipments in before a possible strike at the East and Gulf Coast ports that could have started in mid-January <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/business/port-strike-labor-deal.html" title="">but was averted</a>.</p><p>“Every system has its limitations,” Mr. Gross said, “But the network is far better positioned today than it was at the beginning of the post-pandemic surge.” He said regulatory data that show how many trains are not running because they lack crews or locomotives were not showing any warning signs.</p><p>And Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, noted that storing inventory has significant costs — financing and paying for warehouse space — that may deter companies from accelerating their imports.</p><p>The U.S. also imports huge amounts of goods from China. Mr. Trump said he was going to impose 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods on Saturday.</p><p>Imports from China arrive primarily through the ports. And while the volume of containers coming through U.S. ports has been strong in recent months, the ports — and trucks and railways that move cargo inland — have not had problems handling recent volumes.</p><p>Some businesses are concerned that applying tariffs to goods that currently lack them may slow customs processing at the Mexican and Canadian borders and cause delays. But Adam Lewis, a co-founder and the president of Clearit, an online customs broker, said he did not expect applying new tariffs to be difficult for the brokers.</p><p>While updating the brokers’ software may take a short while, he said, any new tasks relating to tariffs could be done manually without much trouble. “It’s pretty much business as usual,” Mr. Lewis said.</p><p>But there may be delays if U.S. Customs and Border Protection increases its scrutiny to ensure that businesses are complying. The agency did not comment.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
