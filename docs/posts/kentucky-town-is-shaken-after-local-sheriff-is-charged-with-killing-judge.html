Sheriff Stines, known as Mickey to the community, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/us/sheriff-judge-shooting-kentucky.html" title="">surrendered to the police</a> and is now in a nearby county jail, facing a charge of first-degree murder.</p><p>Little is known about why the two men argued or what prompted the gunfire in the district judge’s chambers in the Letcher County courthouse, beyond the initial details that the authorities gave on Thursday evening. But the violence has shaken the county, a tight-knit Appalachian community of <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Letcher_County,_Kentucky?g=050XX00US21133" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 21,000 people</a> that has been battered in recent years by the demise of the coal industry and a series of devastating floods in 2022.</p><p>“We love our neighbors, and we care about each other — we’re all like family, really,” said Mike Watts, the Letcher County Circuit Court clerk, who saw the two men head to lunch before the shooting. “It’s devastating. Everybody’s in shock.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’m grieving for both families,” Mr. Watts added, noting that he was on a separate floor at the time of the shooting. There were, he said, “no words to describe it.”</p><p>The courts were indefinitely closed in the small community of Whitesburg, the county seat about 150 miles southeast of Lexington, and flags were lowered to half-staff. Sheriff Stines, 43, remained in the Leslie County Detention Center as of Friday morning as the court system worked to name a special judge to oversee the case, according to Jackie Steele, one of the state prosecutors handling the case.</p><p>On Thursday, Alita Vogel, director of the Letcher County Public Library in Whitesburg, located just down the street from the courthouse, locked down the building after a patron told her that there was an active shooter nearby. Ms. Vogel, who has worked with both men, lamented the incident.</p><p>“Today, people are saying that the whole atmosphere is like it was after the flood,” said Ms. Vogel, 51, referring to the 2022 flooding. “It’s another tragedy that’s going to affect the community for years to come.”</p><p>In a gesture that underscored how closely intertwined the community was, Matt Butler, the commonwealth’s attorney for Letcher County, and his office recused themselves from the case. Mr. Butler said that one of his office’s staff members was in the judicial suite at the time of the shooting and could be a witness. Mr. Butler also had close professional ties with Mr. Stines, given his role as sheriff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And it was well known, Mr. Butler said in a statement, that he and Judge Mullins “married a pair of sisters and that we have children who are first cousins but act like siblings.”</p><p>“I respected him — we fought hard for our respective sides of court and tried cases against each other before he was a judge,” Mr. Butler said of Judge Mullins in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/matt.butler.750331" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 11-minute video</a> he posted on Facebook. “As a brother-in-law, I will never forget how kind he was to my children.”</p><p>“He would do anything for them,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Butler, who pledged to push for more security for court and legal officials, also strenuously objected to being approached with any rumors or speculation about Judge Mullins and Sheriff Stines, and asked the community to instead pray for the two men’s families.</p><p>“We need to carry the weight of being the good example,” Mr. Butler said. “We’re going to show love.”</p><p>Laci Wright, 18, was working at Coal City Coffee when emergency workers ran to the courthouse at the end of the block. Like most Whitesburg residents, she knew both the judge and the sheriff and went trick-or-treating as a child in McRoberts, where the Stines family lives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“No one here wants to believe that this has happened. Some say Kevin may have been doing something wrong, and others say Mickey may have been doing something wrong,” Ms. Wright said. “But I don’t know the truth.”</p><p>Both men had been in their positions for a few years. Mr. Stines was first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/222786231621955/videos/212637733012800" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elected sheriff in 2018</a> and then <a href="https://www.facebook.com/letchercountysheriff/posts/pfbid02kTT7iNnNPx1vcuX3VyXQv4hVuUBWpFwxAj3yom2jyA273RMK5PN1Yfuw5Sq9Gw2dl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">re-elected in 2022.</a></p><p>He was recently deposed this month as part of an ongoing case involving a former deputy accused of sexually abusing a former inmate. Sheriff Stines, who fired the deputy before he was convicted on related charges, is accused of “deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train and supervise” his former deputy, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Judge Mullins, who was 54, was appointed to the role in 2009 to fill a vacancy on the bench, and won re-election for subsequent full terms. Before that, he had spent about eight years as the assistant commonwealth’s attorney in Letcher County.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.themountaineagle.com/articles/letcher-womans-recovery-began-with-sentencing-by-judge-mullins/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2018 article from The Mountain Eagle</a>, the local newspaper, highlighted Judge Mullins’s efforts to send people struggling with drug addiction to a rehab center, rather than the county jail, for nonviolent offenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Kevin had the drug court — he wanted to help people get off drugs,” said Tom King, 59, who owns a body shop between McRoberts and Jenkins, where Judge Mullins lived.</p><p>“Mickey would talk to people and try to help them out,” added Mr. King, who said he grew up with both men. “Mickey had that drug dog, and they took lots of drugs off the streets of Letcher County.”</p><p>To replace Judge Mullins, Gov. Andy Beshear must appoint four people to the county’s judicial nominating commission to begin the process, a court official said. A retired judge will fill the vacancy when court reopens.</p><p>Campbell Robertson<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->Jack Begg<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane">More about Emily Cochrane</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>15</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Small Kentucky Town Is Shaken by Local Sheriff’s Shooting of a Judge<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
