They performed portions of “Non-Stop,” “My Shot,” “The Schuyler Sisters,” “Guns and Ships,” “You’ll Be Back,” “Yorktown,” “The Room Where It Happens” and “History Has Its Eyes on You.”</p><p>At the 2016 Tonys, “Hamilton” earned 16 nominations and won 11 prizes. Soon after, many of its cast members left the show to take time off or to pursue other projects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Here is a rundown of where everyone has been since that momentous opening run.</p></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-3"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8o4nY-AmkZc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6e1ed2c7">Lin-Manuel Miranda</h2><p>Miranda transformed Broadway with “Hamilton,” which he wrote and starred in, playing the founding father Alexander Hamilton. Miranda’s rise to the top of Hollywood began after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/theater/lin-manuel-miranda-confirms-hes-leaving-hamilton-on-july-9.html" title="">left the show in 2016</a>. That year he contributed to the score of “Moana,” the animated feature, earning an Academy Award nomination for the original song “How Far I’ll Go.” Years later he earned another Oscar nomination for the original song “Dos Oruguitas” from the animated film “Encanto.” He also wrote for other musical films including, “Mufasa: The Lion King” and “The Little Mermaid,” the live-action remake starring Halle Bailey.</p><p>He played Jack in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/movies/mary-poppins-returns-review.html" title="">Mary Poppins Returns</a>” opposite Emily Blunt in 2018 and starred as the piragüero in the 2021 film adaptation of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/movies/in-the-heights-review.html" title="">In the Heights</a>,” the Broadway show he and Quiara Alegría Hudes created.</p><p>Miranda has not shied away from politics, and as recently as March he announced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/theater/hamilton-kennedy-center-trump-miranda.html" title="">“Hamilton” would not participate</a> in the Kennedy Center’s celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence after President Trump took over the institution.</p><p>Miranda is now working with Eisa Davis on a musical adaptation of the film “The Warriors,” after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/theater/lin-manuel-miranda-warriors.html?smid=url-share" title="">release last year</a> of a concept album (called simply “Warriors”).</p><h2 id="link-45672a95">Leslie Odom Jr.</h2><p>Odom, who performed as Aaron Burr in the original production, found new levels of success after his run in “Hamilton” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/20/theater/leslie-odom-jr-leaving-hamilton.html" title="">ended in 2016</a>. He has since acted in movies and television shows, and has released several solo albums.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some of his notable onscreen appearances include playing Dr. Arbuthnot in “Murder on the Orient Express” in 2017. Two years later, he played William Still in “Harriet” opposite Cynthia Erivo, the “Wicked” star who hosted the Tonys telecast on Sunday night. Odom earned two Oscar nominations in 2021 for his work in the movie “One Night in Miami,” which was directed by Regina King — one for best supporting actor for his turn as Sam Cooke, the other for best original song for “Speak Now.”</p><p>Last year, Odom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/30/theater/tony-nominations#leslie-odom-jr-tony-nomination" title="">earned his second Tony nomination</a> for his role as Purlie in the revival of Ossie Davis’s 1961 play “Purlie Victorious,” an uproarious comedy about a Black preacher from Georgia.
