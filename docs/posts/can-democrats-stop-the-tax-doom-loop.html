By the time the tax cuts are set to end, Americans have become used to owing less to the government. Hesitant to raise taxes, Democrats join with Republicans to continue many of the cuts indefinitely.</p><p>To liberals, this cycle is to blame for a range of social and economic ills. Widening inequality. Ballooning deficits. A federal government without the resources to pay for a progressive agenda.</p><p>And next year, they hope, is their chance to finally stop it.</p><p>That’s because much of the last large Republican tax cut, a 2017 law signed by President Donald J. Trump, will expire after 2025. Progressive tax experts and activists have spent years organizing to convince the Democratic Party that rather than simply extending the cuts, it needs to ensure the United States brings in more tax revenue so it can finance more generous social programs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“People want to avenge it,” said Lindsay Owens, the executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group that is meeting with congressional staff and preparing advertising campaigns on the tax debate.</p><p>It’s an uphill fight. Cutting taxes remains a popular political promise. Mr. Trump and Republicans are pushing to extend the law and further reduce taxes if they come into power. While Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to raise taxes on high-income Americans and corporations, her presidential campaign has also said she would not raise taxes on any household making less than $400,000. That means she, too, wants to continue much of Mr. Trump’s tax cut.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Donald J.

And that’s partly why they haven’t been successful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Democratic tax experts still see a narrow path to redemption. They have put together what they believe are politically palatable plans for increasing taxes on very high earners and large corporations. The goal is to raise more than enough revenue to cover the costs of extending other tax cuts.</p><p>“It’s now the case that billionaires can lead a lavish lifestyle and pay little or nothing in federal income taxes,” Ms. Warren said. “That has to be fixed first.”</p><p>While some experts may question the policy wisdom of refusing to raise taxes on all households making less than $400,000, they accept the political imperative. Not only does taxing the rich poll well, but they hope it could also bring the United States closer to a more balanced time in tax policy: the very beginning of the 21st century.</p><p>“In terms of the history of the last two decades, if we’re asking: Can we have a revenue system to support the government that we have? The answer is yes,” David Kamin, a former top economic official in the Biden White House, said. “We about had that, and we made an explicit set of choices in the 21st century to no longer have that.”</p><h2 id="link-42c1cc9e">‘Bad Habits’</h2><p>When Glenn Hubbard came into the White House in 2001 to serve as President George W. Bush’s chief economist, the fiscal outlook was rosy. The economy was strong, and tax revenue was plentiful — too plentiful for many Republicans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In 2000, the government collected tax revenue equivalent to 20 percent of American gross domestic product, the second-highest share of the economy since 1930, the earliest date for the statistic kept by the White House budget office. For a couple of years the government had even run a surplus, bringing in more money than it spent.</p><p>Mr. Bush had run his 2000 campaign on returning the surplus to the American people in the form of tax cuts. For Mr. Hubbard and other Republican economic advisers at the time, draining excess tax revenue would make it harder for Congress to expand government programs in the future.</p><p>“The thinking of the president’s advisers was that Congress was unlikely to save that money,” Mr. Hubbard said.</p><p>So in 2001, and again in 2003, the Bush administration and Republican majorities in Congress cut taxes. The two pieces of legislation, together called the “Bush tax cuts,” reduced marginal income rates across income levels, cut taxes on capital gains and phased out the estate tax, among other steps.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President George W.

Congress and President Barack Obama temporarily extended them in 2010, in part because the economy was still struggling in the wake of the Great Recession. Two years later, Democrats — fearing the economic and political consequences of letting the wide-ranging tax cuts expire — joined with Republicans to extend much of them again.</p><p>In a 2012 deal negotiated by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. McConnell, tax rates went up only for individuals making more than $400,000 and married couples making more than $450,000. Roughly 82 percent of the Bush tax cuts became permanent law, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.</p><p>For Democrats who want to meaningfully increase the amount of tax the federal government collects, the deal has become the party’s original sin on tax policy.</p><p>“That was a place where we started to form a set of bad habits that show up over and over again in these tax negotiations,” Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, said. Mr. Bennet was one of just three Democrats to oppose the deal in the Senate at the time. “There’s been an asymmetry because Democrats have been willing to capitulate in ways that we shouldn’t have.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-3a71917b">A Turning Tide?</h2><p>In 2017, after Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the White House, Republicans moved quickly to cut taxes again. The corporate tax rate plummeted to 21 percent from 35 percent, marginal rates across nearly every income bracket fell, the standard deduction became larger and the child tax credit grew, among many other changes.</p><p>As with the Bush tax cuts, Republicans passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through a congressional procedure called reconciliation. To comply with that process’s rules — and to avoid recording a huge increase in the deficit — many of the law’s provisions were again temporary.</p><p>While the outcome in 2017 was familiar, some Democrats started to sense a change. The Bush tax cuts had largely been popular, and conservatives saw huge political upside in cutting taxes.</p><p>But the Trump tax cut wasn’t popular. Democrats unanimously opposed it, branding the law as a giveaway to the rich. That attack was bolstered by analyses showing that the biggest benefits of the law flowed to upper-income Americans, though it also helped many working-class Americans. In polls, many Americans said they didn’t know how the tax law would affect them.</p><p>Progressives soon started to feel that they were gaining the upper hand on tax policy. Ideas about taxing the rich and corporations that had been relegated to the party’s left wing began migrating toward its center. Rather than boasting about the tax cuts, Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/us/politics/economy-politics-midterms.html" title="">avoided them</a> during the 2018 midterms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“That was a moment where we actually saw that the progressive messaging against the tax law actually was effective,” said Bryan Bennett, the senior director for polling and analytics at the Hub Project, a progressive advocacy group.</p><p>The law did help jump-start some investment and economic growth. The fiscal costs are also considerable. Mr. Kamin and Brian Deese, another former top economic official in the Biden White House, estimated in an essay last year that the tax cuts passed under Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush had reduced tax revenue as a share of gross domestic product by three percentage points.</p><p>Some conservatives agree that tax revenue as a share of G.D.P. — which stood at 16.5 percent last fiscal year after a spike in 2022 — is surprisingly low given the economy’s performance.</p><p>“We’re within the range but at a disturbingly low part of the range given the booming economy we’ve had in recent years,” said George Callas, the executive vice president of public finance at Arnold Ventures and a former Republican tax aide on Capitol Hill.</p><h2 id="link-4009f28">Playing Hardball</h2><p>Under President Biden, some tax increases did pass, including one that requires large companies to pay at least 15 percent on the income they report to investors. An infusion of funding to the Internal Revenue Service is also supposed to help the agency crack down on tax evasion and collect money that is owed to the government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>But those steps still fell far short of addressing what progressives see as an underperforming tax system. They consider the coming showdown over the Trump tax cuts their best chance to stop the doom loop.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden signing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>To try to harden Democrats’ hearts ahead of the talks, the party’s tax experts and academics have been pushing the idea that letting the 2017 tax cuts expire entirely would not be such a bad outcome. They have pointed to soaring deficits and argued that the economy could absorb higher taxes without slowing growth. The goal is to make the party comfortable with the possibility of walking away from talks with Republicans if Democrats don’t score enough victories — and avoid repeating the saga over the Bush tax cuts.</p><p>“You do have the card of letting it all expire because, frankly, it’s not going to be that noticeable of a tax increase for middle America,” Kimberly Clausing, a former Treasury official in the Biden administration, said.</p><p>But some elected Democrats may still not share the progressive tax world’s enthusiasm for raising taxes. In 2021, a single senator, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, then a Democrat, ruled out many hoped-for tax increases like raising the corporate rate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Democrats next year are likely to want to protect tax breaks for high-earning and corporate constituents. Donors are already leaning on Ms. Harris to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/us/politics/donors-harris-tax-ultrawealthy.html" title="">pare back proposed tax increases on the ultrawealthy</a>. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat and the majority leader, vowed recently that a $10,000 limit on deducting state and local taxes would end next year, a change that would benefit rich Americans and cost roughly $1 trillion in tax revenue.</p><p>In any case, progressives know that the 2025 tax debate will not be the end of their quest to fundamentally change the tax code.</p><p>“Practically speaking, it’s going to take a long time to get back; we’re not going to do it in one fell swoop,” said Michael Linden, a former budget official in the Biden White House. “The key is we have to stop going in the wrong direction.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
