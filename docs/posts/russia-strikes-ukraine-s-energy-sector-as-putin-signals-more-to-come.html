Putin said was retaliation for Kyiv’s hitting Russian territory with long-range American missiles.</p><p>Mr. Putin suggested that such strikes could be stepped up, after millions of Ukrainians were left without power on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said. Ukraine’s energy ministry said it was the 11th major attack on the country’s energy infrastructure this year.</p><p>The total extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but explosions were heard in cities across Ukraine, and many officials reported power outages. Six people were reported injured across the country, according to the regional authorities.</p><p>“The energy sector is under massive enemy attack again,” Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, wrote on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/german.galushchenko/posts/pfbid021ZTz8PkwZSpbbXPoSxkGfJJguC9gUZr7otXVS4DdiRkc9ifDnRc9DuUFU3JDtWfMl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his Facebook page</a>. The operator of the Ukrainian transmission system “has urgently introduced emergency power outages,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in an escalating cycle of strikes against each other in recent weeks. While attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have long been a tactic used by Russia, some analysts say both sides are also trying to improve their negotiating position before the inauguration of President-elect Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Trump has promised to end the conflict, without specifying how.</p><p>Speaking at a meeting of a Moscow-led security alliance in Kazakhstan, Mr. Putin warned that Russian strikes on Ukraine could intensify, saying that his country has been selecting targets for missile strikes in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and that they might include “decision-making centers” there.</p><p>“At present, the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff are selecting targets to hit on Ukrainian territory,” Mr. Putin said. “These could be military facilities, defense and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centers in Kyiv.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taking shelter in a subway station after an air raid warning in Kyiv on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tetiana Dzhafarova/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attack.html" title="">said on Tuesday</a> that Ukraine had used more than a dozen U.S.-delivered missiles known as Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, to strike its territory twice in the previous few days. That came after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia-atacms-missiles.html" title="">a Ukrainian attack involving the same missiles last week</a>, the first time Ukraine had used the longer-range weapons to strike in Russia since the United States granted permission to use them this month.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That strike prompted Russia to respond by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/europe/russia-ballistic-missile-ukraine-war.html" title="">test firing an Oreshnik</a>, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/europe/russia-ballistic-missile-ukraine-war.html" title="">intermediate-range ballistic missile</a> designed to deliver nuclear weapons, though it was not armed with nuclear warheads.</p><p>Mr. Putin said that Russia would respond forcefully to strikes on its territory with the use of long-range Western-made missiles, “possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions.”</p><p>Mr. Putin said Russia had several Oreshnik missiles in stock that are “ready to be used.”</p><p>Speaking later at a news conference that concluded his visit to Kazakhstan, Mr. Putin said that Russia would use “all available weapons” at its disposal if Ukraine acquired nuclear arms. Earlier, some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">Western officials had suggested</a> that the United States could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p><p>After the strikes Thursday, more than a million people were without power in the western regions of Lviv, Volyn and Rivne, officials said. Farther to the east, the city of Zhytomyr was without power and water. The southern city of Kherson was also without electricity, as was much of Kyiv.</p><p>Ihor Polishchuk, the mayor of Lutsk in the Volyn region of western Ukraine, said there had been several hits on his city and the surrounding area.

It said that 79 missiles were downed, and that all of the drones were either downed or jammed.
