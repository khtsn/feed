The World Health Organization <a href="https://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/Sitrep_57.pdf?ua=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> last month that 33 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals had been damaged during the war, and that only 21 remained partly functional.

He added that staff were vetted and that Hamas government offices were not hosted at the medical facility.</p><p>“We’re not doing anything other than medicine,” he said.</p><p>The Kuwait Specialty Field Hospital was treating a minimum of 3,500 patients every day, according to Dr. al-Hamss.</p><p>“The hospital,” he said, “is providing a solution to the people in light of the collapse of the heath sector in Gaza.”</p><p>Patrick Kingsley<!-- --> contributed reporting to this article.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
