    <h1>Oil Prices Jump After Biden Says ‘Discussing’ Potential Israeli Strike on Iranian Facilities</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When asked if he would allow Israel to retaliate against Iran, which said it had launched the missiles in retaliation for the assassinations of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, its proxies, Mr. Biden said: “First of all, we don’t ‘allow’ Israel. We advise Israel. And there is nothing going to happen today.”</p><p>Iran is a major oil producer, pumping about two million barrels a day, or about 2 percent of the world’s supply. Its production and sales are hampered by international sanctions, and most of its exports are bought by China.</p><p>The intensifying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/02/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah#here-are-the-latest-developments" title="">fighting between Israel and Iran</a> and Iranian-backed groups, especially Hezbollah in Lebanon, has pushed up oil prices this week. The main concern is that the escalating conflict could prompt Tehran to try to restrict the flow of oil from key exporters like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Prices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/business/iran-israel-oil-prices.html" title="">haven’t climbed back to their peaks</a> this year, however, because those worries have been largely outweighed by factors like weak energy demand in China and increased oil production in the United States and elsewhere.</p><p>An agreement reached in June by Saudi Arabia and seven other oil producers to begin unwinding some production cuts also continues to weigh on prices. While these increases were recently postponed, the anticipation of increased supplies coming onto the market has offset some of the worry about potential outages stemming from fighting between Iran and Israel.</p></div></div>
