He didn’t let me. Somehow, in his mind, he thinks it’s going to come back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Scan your eyes around New York City, and you’ll spot them everywhere, these artifacts of the pandemic, lingering through intent or indifference.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A sign on a bus warning people to keep a safe distance from the driver." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 820w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/27/multimedia/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc/00pandemic-traces-02-qjhc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1639w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/243f9d1d-4b49-5a37-8a05-2fb154c4b0c3" decoding="async" width="600" height="750"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>These remnants of that anxious time now serve as some of the only public reminders of those deadly years.</p><p>Weathered signs mandating mask use, QR codes posted around restaurant tabletops, faded social distancing stickers plastered on the ground — taken together, they form an urban fossil record of a place that has otherwise largely moved on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Forget removing the gum on the sidewalk,” said Patrick Willingham, the executive director of the Public Theater in Manhattan. “The stickers are permanent. They’ll never get them off the ground.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Take a walk through the Queens neighborhoods surrounding Elmhurst Hospital — the epicenter of the city’s pandemic response — where a “Stop the Spread” sign still hangs prominently near the entrance of the emergency room.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At Hector Escobar Hair Studio, a salon nearby on 37th Avenue, a “Certificate of Disinfection” is centrally displayed on the door. To the south, at Fay Da, a Chinese bakery on Broadway, an “Affirmation of Compliance With Workplace Vaccination Requirements” is posted on the storefront glass. And at Khao Kang, a Thai restaurant on Woodside Avenue, plump bottles of Purell rest on each of the six dining tables inside.</p><p>“I think it’s a good reminder for people,” said Joe Secanky, a nurse from Milwaukee, who pumped sanitizer onto his hands one recent afternoon before sharing a fiery spread of food with his wife, Edna.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Like the bottles of sanitizer, certain remnants of the pandemic have maintained some utility in the present day.</p><p>Mighty Oak Roasters, in Astoria, Queens, is one of many businesses around the city that has continued to operate a sidewalk window for takeout orders.</p><p>“It’s great for people with dogs or strollers and people who ride their bikes,” said Peter Moses, a co-founder of the coffee shop, which keeps a small sign out front telling customers that masks are still appreciated. (At least one staffer, Mr. Moses said, is immunocompromised.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>New Yorkers can also unearth traces of the pandemic in their homes. Alongside the typical detritus — stacks of Covid tests, boxes of gloves, Pelotons — are often things imbued with more meaning.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Moses, for example, has kept a half-used bottle of hand sanitizer from his friends’ wedding in 2021 on a living room shelf. Its label has a timely message: “Share love, not germs.” He thought it was an object worth remembering.</p><p>Likewise, some New Yorkers have tried to turn the vestiges of Covid into something beautiful.</p><p>Those ordering from the bar these days at Night of Joy, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, face a decorative latticework spanning the length of the counter. During the height of the pandemic, the structure had a huge plastic sheet stretched across it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I agonized for weeks back then about how to make the most beautiful sneeze guard I could,” said Jen Armstrong, the owner of the bar.</p><p>With the help of a local artist, Alexander Barton, she realized her vision, purchasing gardening trellises made of willow from Home Depot and painting them gold.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>As the worst of the pandemic wound down, Ms. Armstrong removed the plastic sheets, but kept the barriers. She realized they had become a part of her bar’s aesthetic and a conversation starter. She had received compliments from customers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>And though the trellises have worn down over the years — “Drunk people like to touch fragile things,” she said — she would now rather renovate or replace them than remove them altogether.</p><p>“It became a happy accident,” she said. “I’m proud of myself for taking such a horrible object and making it into something that, you know, means something else.”</p><p>The most visible traces of the pandemic across the city, though, may be the masks that still dangle from some peoples’ faces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The days of mandates and widespread usage are, of course, long over. A sign that remains posted near the entrance of the subway at 40th Street and Broadway in Manhattan — “Face coverings are required” — goes entirely ignored by the throngs of riders who pass by each day.</p><p>And yet it has remained relatively common to see a few people wearing masks in a crowded train car or indoor space — a practice that was basically nonexistent in the city before the pandemic, aside from the occasional tourist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>A number of the city’s performance spaces — including the Public Theater, where Mr. Willingham is the executive director — have even continued to offer occasional shows where masks are required. And when they are not, Mr. Willingham said, there are still always some mask users in the audience.</p><p>“It’s become part of the landscape,” he said.</p><p>They’ve become a subtle part of the landscape, too, at Sevilla Restaurant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Since the end of the pandemic, the restaurant’s in-house guitar player, a musician in his 70s, has continued wearing his mask while singing songs around the dining room.</p><p>He does it for his safety, Mr. Lloves said, but it has caused occasional displeasure among certain outspoken guests.</p><p>“He’s a constant reminder, and some people don’t like that,” Mr. Lloves said. “I think it disturbs them. They almost don’t want to be reminded. They’d rather not think about it.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
