Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office <a href="https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/1854748574757650787" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the sending of the rescue planes and said that he had spoken with Prime Minister Dick Schoof of the Netherlands.</p><p>Mr. Schoof said in a <a href="https://x.com/MinPres/status/1854768172211065248" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> early Friday that there had been antisemitic attacks on Israelis in Amsterdam, calling them “completely unacceptable.” He added that the situation had calmed and that he had told Mr. Netanyahu in their phone conversation that the perpetrators would be found and prosecuted.</p><p>For hours, from Thursday evening to early Friday, hundreds of fans of the Israeli soccer club, Maccabi Tel Aviv, who were in Amsterdam to see their team play against Ajax, Amsterdam’s soccer team, were being ambushed, the Embassy of Israel in the Netherlands said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Mobs chanted anti-Israel slogans and proudly shared videos of their violent acts on social media — kicking, beating, even running over Israeli citizens,” the embassy said on <a href="https://x.com/IsraelinNL/status/1854773621249786333" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p><p>As the attacks went on, Israel warned its citizens in Amsterdam to stay off the streets and remain in their hotel rooms. Maccabi Tel Aviv warned people not to show Israeli or Jewish symbols outside, and urged them to fly back to Israel as soon as they could.</p><p>“Our main goal is the safe and quick return of the fans to Israel,” the team wrote on <a href="https://x.com/MaccabiTLVFC/status/1854764918589079856" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p><p>Videos circulated on social media showing violent clashes on Amsterdam’s streets. One <a href="https://x.com/iAnnetnl/status/1854664685469028610" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> verified by Reuters captured a crowd of more than a dozen men appearing to attack someone near the city center early Friday. The crowd dispersed when emergency sirens could be heard.</p><p>“We woke up this morning to shocking images and videos that since October 7th, we had hoped never to see again: an antisemitic pogrom,” said Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, on <a href="https://x.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/1854771676891791407" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> on Friday.</p><p>The Dutch police said in a <a href="https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2024/november/8/05-57-aanhoudingen-rondom-de-voetbalwedstrijd-ajax---maccabi-tel-aviv-fc.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Friday that 57 arrests were made in connection with the unrest, some of which took place at or near the Johan Cruyff Arena, where the soccer game was played.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The clashes, which began Thursday, happened in areas where people had gathered, some in support of the Israeli team and others to protest its arrival, the police statement said.</p><p>Hundreds of Maccabi supporters gathered in Amsterdam’s center early Thursday afternoon, where the atmosphere was initially tense but gradually became calmer, the police said in the statement. Ten people were arrested there before the game, the police said, mostly on charges of disrupting the public order.</p><p>At another square called Anton de Komplein, which is near the stadium, people protesting the arrival of Maccabi Tel Aviv clashed with the military police after trying to make their way to the stadium. Amsterdam’s mayor, Femke Halsema, had earlier prohibited the protest from happening at the stadium and ordered it to take place at that square.</p><p>About 30 people were arrested in that confrontation on charges of disrupting the public order and setting off fireworks at the police, the police said.</p><p>Gideon Saar, Israel’s newly appointed foreign minister, said that his ministry was working with the Dutch authorities to respond to the violence, and that those needing help should contact the authorities.</p><p>Qasim Nauman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nadav Gavrielov<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Sports</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping professional, collegiate and amateur athletics.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Watching the World Series: </strong>Little Toyko restaurants in Los Angeles and New York bodegas were among the places that moonlighted as sports bars as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/10/29/nyregion/dodgers-yankees-fans-watch-world-series">fans in both cities sought communal viewing experiences</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>College Football Is Big Business: </strong>Players are dealing with far-flung travel, jet lag and the pressures of trying to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/college-football-conference-realignment.html">balance the roles of student, athlete and entrepreneur</a> more than ever before.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remembering Fernandomania: </strong>Fernando Valenzuela, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/sports/fernando-valenzuela-dead.html">who died at age 63</a>, was a teenage phenomenon from Mexico who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/style/fernando-valenzuela-fernandomania.html">remade the Dodgers’ fan base</a> and put his country on the baseball map.</p></li><li><p><strong>N.Y.C.’s Long Wait Ends: </strong>The Liberty, one of the original W.N.B.A. teams, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/nyregion/new-york-liberty-champions.html">finally won their first championship</a>, and New York got its first basketball title in 48 years.</p></li><li><p><strong>The N.F.L.’s $20 Billion Man: </strong>Under the expansionist leadership of its commissioner, Roger Goodell, the league is growing richer. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/business/roger-goodell-nfl.html">So, too, is Goodell</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
