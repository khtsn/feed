Their young daughters were thriving. On weekends, the family of five visited nearby Buck Creek State Park and worshiped at a local church. They moved into what they thought would be their forever home.</p><p>“We were very comfortable here, thinking Springfield is our place,” Mr. Delva said in an interview, almost two years to the day since receiving the keys to a cream-colored, three-bedroom house.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>It has been a month since former President Donald J. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, injected Springfield into the election by spreading baseless rumors about Haitians abducting and eating pets. But many immigrants are still shaken, reordering their daily routines and reconsidering whether to stay where they feel unwanted and unsafe.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/multimedia/08nat-springfield-haitians-10-qzwm/08nat-springfield-haitians-10-qzwm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/multimedia/08nat-springfield-haitians-10-qzwm/08nat-springfield-haitians-10-qzwm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/multimedia/08nat-springfield-haitians-10-qzwm/08nat-springfield-haitians-10-qzwm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="The view of a child’s bed with stuffed animals, next to a bedroom window.

Ku Klux Klan fliers have popped up around town. A neo-Nazi group waved swastikas in front of the home of the mayor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/us/rob-rue-springfield-ohio-mayor-trump.html" title="">Rob Rue</a>, who has praised Haitians’ contributions while acknowledging the challenges created by the influx of new residents.</p><p>Most of the newly arrived Haitians are in the country legally, many of them granted what is known as Temporary Protected Status because of the widespread violence and instability in their homeland. Last week, Mr. Trump said that he would <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-springfield-haitian-migrants-removed/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rescind Haitians’ Temporary Protected Status</a> and deport them.</p><p>In the streets and stores, strangers have hurled insults at Haitians. The tires on their cars have been slashed overnight. Some shoppers have meowed at Haitians in supermarket aisles, according to Haitians, community leaders and immigrant advocates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After hearing from friends who have been targeted, Mr. Delva, 43, said that he had no choice but to take precautions.</p><p>Gone are the afternoons at the park for his girls, ages 10, 5 and 2. Outings to Chuck E. Cheese have been scrapped. Even playtime in the backyard is on hold.</p><p>“Everybody is staying inside,” Mr. Delva said, except to go to school, commute to work or shop for groceries.</p><p>“I can’t remember the last time we went to church,” he said. “I talk to a lot of friends who are very scared, too.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many of the newly arrived Haitians have been granted Temporary Protected Status because of the instability in their homeland.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Since former President Donald J.

They have filled jobs in manufacturing, distribution and the service sector that were available after the city created a revitalization plan that attracted new businesses to the area.</p><p>Haitians are not the first newcomers to face hostility in Springfield.</p><p>In the early 20th century, the city drew poor southerners, white and Black, to work in<span>  </span>factories. In 1904, a Black man was lynched and a Black neighborhood was set ablaze. Members of the Ku Klux Klan paraded through the streets.</p><p>White migrants were derided as backward people with “undesirable qualities of the new immigrant,” Max Fraser, a labor scholar, wrote in “Hillbilly Highway,” his history of Appalachian migration.</p><p>In the 1990s, Hispanics began arriving in Springfield and they, too, faced discrimination, said Jason Barlow, a representative in Ohio for United Automobile Workers, whose grandfather migrated to Springfield from Alabama in the 1940s. “It’s not the first time we see this animosity, unfortunately.” .</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But the Haitians have been settling in Springfield at a moment when immigration has become one of the most contentious issues in the country, fueled by Mr. Trump, who has vilified immigrants and promised mass deportations if he returns to the White House. The influx of newcomers had strained government services in Springfield and had been fueling anxiety and tensions in the city, even before Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/trump-debate-immigrants-pets.html" title="">used the presidential debate last month to stoke the debunked rumors of pet abductions</a>. In the days that followed, Springfield faced a wave of bomb threats and Haitians encountered growing hostility from inside and outside the city.</p><p>“I haven’t seen hate rise to this level in my lifetime,” said Mr. Barlow, 50, who grew up in Springfield.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance have dismissed the outcry over the comments and instead have redoubled their attacks on Haitians in the United States.</p><p>In interviews, dozens of Haitians in Springfield said that they had fled their homeland to survive or to provide for loved ones living through the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed Haiti.</p><p><a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1157971/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nearly half of the country’s population</a> is experiencing acute food insecurity, according to experts, and many have been forced to abandon their homes as gangs take territory. Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/haiti-gang-attack.html?smid=url-share" title="">gangs rampaged through a town in Haiti’s main agricultural region, killing at least 70 people</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>It is impossible to know how many Haitians have left Springfield because of the recent intimidation, but everyone seems to know someone who has relocated, or who is weighing that option.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amanda Mullins, a real estate agent, said some Haitians who were saving to buy homes had given up. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Haitians have been settling in Springfield at a time when immigration has become one of the most contentious issues in the country. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Amanda Mullins, a real estate agent, said that Haitians who had saved as much as $50,000 to make down payments on homes have given up. One buyer backed out of a signed contract.</p><p>“Most everybody wants to wait,” Ms. Mullins said during a drive through northern Springfield, where she pointed to homes that she had sold to Haitians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Lamarre Joseph, a 55-year-old teacher, and Charly Colin, a 41-year-old agronomist, share a two-bedroom apartment and work at a warehouse to support their families in Haiti. They were among those who said that they were contemplating leaving Springfield.</p><p>“We’ll find another city — Columbus, Boston, New York,” Mr. Joseph said. “We’ll go where there is opportunity.”</p><p>But for families with children, like the Delvas, Springfield is home. Even amid the fear and hate, uprooting is a tough option to consider.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-21"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Delvas have made a home for themselves in Springfield, away from the gang problems in their home country.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Delvas left Haiti because of threats on Mr. Delva’s life that stemmed from his job.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The Delvas were financially secure in Haiti.
