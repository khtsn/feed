The resort hosted the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/squaw-valley-1960" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1960 Winter Olympics</a> when it was still called Squaw Valley, and is among the <a href="https://www.fis-ski.com/alpine-skiing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alpine Ski World Cup</a>’s few regular stops in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Palisades base area has dining, an active après scene and activities like disco tubing, which adds party lights and music to the usual experience.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yet at times, it feels as if all people talk about is the weather.</p><p>Take my first visit to the resort, this past February, which took place in a windy whiteout.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On the first day, I rode up the tram from the Palisades base area, then felt my way down the blue runs off the Siberia Express and Gold Coast Express lifts in a sea of white on white. Palisades Tahoe is known for its bowls, chutes and gullies, especially off the KT-22 chair, but I was not ready to venture there essentially blindfolded.</p><p>While I was trying to find my bearings on Emigrant Face — a bowl-like blue area off one of the highest lifts — a snowboarder zoomed by so fast that he didn’t see a ridge in the fog and took off like an eagle. An eagle that couldn’t fly, because he crashed.</p><p>Still, against all odds, I was having fun.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Skiers taking a break inside the Alpine Lodge, which is on the quieter side of the resort. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And so was Joan Collins, 60, from Madison, Wis., whom I met during lunch at the Alpine base area the next day, when it was marginally less foggy but snowing hard. “For me the hardest part was not seeing the horizon, snow blowing in your face so you can’t really see where you’re going,” said Ms. Collins. “But we’ve been hollering all the way down on some of those runs — it’s like a big, powdery playground.”</p><p>As snow fell relentlessly, parts of the mountain were closed for avalanche mitigation. Several lifts were on hold because of winds that, I later learned, could reach 100 miles per hour on the ridge tops. By noon it was obvious I really should have refreshed my jacket’s waterproofing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>My visit coincided with a big dump of snow after an alarmingly dry December and an average January. Not long after, in early March, a <a href="https://abc7news.com/lake-tahoe-snowstorm-traffic-sierra-snow/14491747/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major storm</a> dropped eight feet of snow on the resort. Which might sound amazing to powder hounds, except that the roads and lifts were closed.</p><p>This year, true to form, good conditions allowed the resort to kick off its season five days early in November.</p><h2 id="link-27d18250">First in line for storms</h2><p>This yo-yo pattern comes from the resort’s location, 200 miles east of San Francisco. The local mountains, part of the Sierra Nevada range, are first in line when moisture-laden storms travel eastward from the Pacific. And with nothing to slow it down, the unimpeded jet stream can hit Palisades Tahoe with hurricane force. The resort’s relatively low altitude, with a main base at 6,200 feet, helps create conditions that can vary drastically within a single day as well as between the upper and the lower mountains. At least the Palisades base has great easygoing terrain at the top, so beginners and intermediates can enjoy good snow quality instead of being stuck on scraped-out or wet runs at lower elevations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Base to Base gondola connects the Palisades and Alpine sections of the resort, which were once separate mountains. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palisades Tahoe often gets hits by storms coming off the Pacific, but on sunny days it can be warmer than other ski areas. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>There are other big upsides. When it’s not snowing, “we have really nice weather for a Western ski destination,” said Bryan Allegretto, the Northern Sierra specialist at the forecasting and conditions site <a href="https://opensnow.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenSnow</a>. “When the sun’s out, it’s warm relative to a lot of mountain areas, so you get this beautiful, amazing weather for skiing that isn’t super cold.” (The average daytime high in January is 36 degrees.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>And in a good year, the season can extend well into the spring. “I ski as long as the resort is open — there’s been several years when I skied on July 4,” Stephanie Yu, 49, who lives in Sacramento, said in a phone interview after my trip.</p><h2 id="link-5a7cdde9">A long history and a new name</h2><p>No wonder Palisades Tahoe is among the most popular winter destinations in America, even if, technically speaking, it was born only three years ago.</p><p>The mountain opened in 1949 as Squaw Valley and acquired its neighbor, Alpine Meadows, seven miles away, in 2011. The new entity went by the cumbersome umbrella Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows until it was rebranded as Palisades Tahoe in 2021, to avoid a term that is offensive to many Native Americans.</p><p>The next year a gondola connecting the base areas at the two mountains was installed; there is also a free on-demand shuttle between the two.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Yet part of the Palisades Tahoe draw is how distinct its two components have remained. Palisades is bigger and sleeker, with more and better dining options, an active après scene, activities like disco tubing (which adds party lights and pumping music to regular tubing), and big-time concerts — this year, <a href="https://www.palisadestahoe.com/events-and-activities/events-calendar/tahoe-live" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diplo</a> was among the performers.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-16"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Funitel — the name is a mash-up of the French words “funiculaire” and “téléphérique” — offers access to the upper portions of Palisades Tahoe.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After a day on the slopes, guests gather for après-ski.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The plentiful lifts include a tram and a hybrid known as the Funitel (a mash-up of the French words “funiculaire” and “téléphérique”), and there is an abundance of signature terrain, which, in addition to the KT-22-served runs, includes open steeps off the Headwall and Siberia lifts (unfortunately, among the first to close because of wind) and a bumps minefield named after the local Olympic freestyle skier <a href="https://olympics.com/en/athletes/jonny-moseley" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonny Moseley</a>.</p><p>The Palisades side is so spread out that you can easily move on to another section of the mountain if one gets closed off or too crowded. After struggling with low visibility on my first day, I eventually found better conditions in the Shirley bowl on the back side. Then, to flee both the crowds and the increasingly strong wind, I headed to the Snow King area, tucked away to the far left of the mountain, as you look uphill. From the Red Dog and Far East Express lifts, I made laps on runs that meandered through trees.</p><p>More complicated was securing a parking spot for my rental car. Palisades Tahoe is part of the <a href="https://www.ikonpass.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ikon</a> multiresort pass and in recent years has experienced an increase in crowds and traffic. Palisades visitors who don’t stay on-mountain tend to favor Truckee, a town 11 miles away, but Route 89 from there to Palisades can easily turn into a long ribbon of vehicles. (I stayed seven miles from the resort in the other direction, in tiny Tahoe City, which offers an easier commute.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>To deal with the crunch, Palisades Tahoe has started requiring parking reservations on Saturdays, Sundays and select holidays. You can book a spot for $30 or try your luck when free reservations open on the Tuesday before the weekend, with sign-up windows at 12 p.m. and 7 p.m. On my first attempt, I hadn’t even completed setting up my account before all the spaces were gone in 12 minutes. A few hours later, it took only six minutes for them to fill up, but I was ready and got a free spot</p><h2 id="link-41e645b2">Unassuming Alpine</h2><p>Compared with the Palisades side’s extroverted, big personality, Alpine still feels like an unassuming locals’ hill, with a trail map that looks underfed. Don’t underestimate it: “A lot of the best terrain is hike-to only, well hidden to where your average user won’t find it,” said Mark Fisher, who, with another local, runs a site called <a href="https://unofficialalpine.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unofficial Alpine</a> that reports on the mountain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-20"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Alpine side of the mountain offers a quieter alternative to the bustling slopes of the Palisades area.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Skiers and snowboarders making their way down a slope at the Alpine section of the resort.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Najera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>For a newcomer, though, the layout felt instinctive and easy, and I was able to have fun with the handful of lifts open on my visit, like the punishingly slow two-seater Yellow Chair — where a wild gust made me slide backward when I disembarked.</p><p>I also got schooled on an innocent-looking blue run off Roundhouse Express, when my skis hopelessly sank into what looked like mounds of fluffy powder but felt like quicksand. Welcome to the notorious heavy snow known as Sierra cement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Yet something was happening. Trees offered shelter when I needed it, the runs were half empty, there were no lines anywhere, and the snow kept falling. I wasn’t even cold.</p><p>Fine, count me in: There is something to be said about California skiing.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
