Trump is wasting little time in taking on the three governmental institutions that most frustrated his political ambitions during his first term and making clear he will not brook resistance in his second.</p><p>With his selections of lieutenants to lead the Justice Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies, Mr. Trump passed over the sorts of establishment figures he installed in those posts eight years ago in favor of firebrand allies with unconventional résumés whose most important qualification may be loyalty to him.</p><p>The choices of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/matt-gaetz-trump-attorney-general.html" title="">Matt Gaetz</a> for attorney general, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-trump.html" title="">Pete Hegseth</a> for defense secretary and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-tulsi-gabbard-director-national-intelligence.html" title="">Tulsi Gabbard</a> for director of national intelligence in the past few days shocked a capital that perhaps should not have been all that surprised. Anyone who listened to Mr. Trump’s promises and grievances on the campaign trail over the past couple of years could have easily anticipated that he would elevate compatriots <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/gaetz-gabbard-hegseth-trump-appointees.html" title="">willing to execute his hostile takeover of government</a>.</p><p>If confirmed, Mr. Gaetz, Mr. Hegseth and Ms. Gabbard would constitute the lead shock troops in Mr. Trump’s self-declared war on the deep state. All three have echoed his conviction that government is seeded with career public servants who actively thwarted his priorities while he was in office and targeted him after he left. None of them has the kind of experience relevant to these jobs comparable to predecessors of either party, but they can all be expected to take “a blowtorch” to the status quo, to use Stephen K. Bannon’s term for Mr. Gaetz.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“You tried to destroy Trump; you tried to imprison Trump; you tried to break Trump,” Mr. Bannon, a onetime White House strategist for Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/steve-bannon-threatens-ari-melber-says-matt-gaetzs-doj-is-coming-for-him-and-all-the-producers-of-msnbc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on his podcast</a> on Wednesday after Mr. Gaetz’s nomination was announced. “He’s not breakable. You couldn’t destroy him. And now he has turned on you.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s promises and grievances on the campaign trail indicated that he would elevate compatriots willing to execute his hostile takeover of government.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Bannon singled out hosts, producers and guests on MSNBC as well as former investigators and F.B.I. officials as an example of targets Mr. Gaetz would come after if given the power to prosecute. “I understood they feared us,” he went on. “And why do they fear us? Because we were coming to take down the globalists and the deep state.”</p><p>The choice of Mr. Gaetz especially was so astonishing to many in Washington that even Republicans had a hard time at first grasping whether Mr. Trump was serious. He seemed to almost relish the metaphorical heads exploding across Capitol Hill. “He’s just trolling America at this point,” Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House aide who broke with him, <a href="https://x.com/Alyssafarah/status/1856797570200429051" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s willingness to pick nominees who once would have been unimaginable has also extended beyond the national security agencies. On Thursday, Mr. Trump chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former presidential candidate who made a name leading an anti-vaccine movement, to be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/rfk-jr-trump-hhs.html" title="">secretary of health and human services</a>. For secretary of homeland security, Mr. Trump has tapped Gov. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/kristi-noem-homeland-security-secretary-trump.html" title="">Kristi Noem</a> of South Dakota, whose prospects for vice president vanished with her admission that she shot her own dog because it could not be tamed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the Justice Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies were the three areas of government that proved to be the most stubborn obstacles to Mr. Trump’s previous efforts to legitimize his presidency and overturn his defeat in 2020 to hold on to power.</p><p>The intelligence agencies stood by their assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the goal of helping Mr. Trump defeat Hillary Clinton, despite a fierce backlash from the newly elected president who publicly declared that he believed President Vladimir V. Putin’s denials instead.</p><p>The Justice Department refused Mr. Trump’s demands to prosecute many of his adversaries, including Mrs. Clinton, former President Barack Obama and his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/us/politics/trump-investigations-enemies.html" title="">it did investigate others who had angered the president</a>. More critically, the department rebuffed pressure to publicly declare that there were substantial irregularities in the 2020 election to justify reversing Mr. Biden’s victory.</p><p>The Pentagon, for its part, made clear that it would not cooperate with an illegal effort to use troops against domestic opponents or help Mr. Trump stay in office. Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general and Trump ally, tried to persuade the president in December 2020 to declare a form of martial law and order the military to seize voting equipment and rerun the election in states that he lost. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had signaled for months that he would not allow the military to be turned into a political weapon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gen.

Mr. Gaetz, a Florida Republican who just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/matt-gaetz-resign-congress-trump.html" title="">resigned his seat in the House</a>, has been a fierce critic of the department he may take over — a department that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/matt-gaetz-ethics-committee-report.html" title="">investigated him for sex trafficking</a> before dropping the matter.</p><p>Just this week, Mr. Gaetz suggested abolishing the F.B.I. and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which would report to him as attorney general. As it is, Mr. Trump after the inauguration is widely expected to fire Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director he installed in 2017, for being too independent.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth, a Fox News weekend host who came to Mr. Trump’s attention <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/30/us/politics/trump-seals-eddie-gallagher.html" title="">defending a convicted military war criminal</a>, served as a major in the Army National Guard and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, but has no experience running a large organization, much less an armed force of two million troops. He too has been a ferocious defender of Mr. Trump and has assailed what he calls the modern “woke” military.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who quit her party and backed Mr. Trump, spent two decades in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve, rising to lieutenant colonel, but has no experience in the intelligence agencies she would oversee. She has often echoed Russia’s positions on Ukraine and NATO, to the point that a Russian state television host famously called her <a href="https://x.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1509330152735584262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1509330152735584262%7Ctwgr%5E2365479a82ee3f171f73f2defda8f3d6513d5e78%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.latintimes.com%2Frussian-state-tv-calls-trump-national-intelligence-director-nominee-our-girlfriend-tulsi-565853" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“our girlfriend.”</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Compare those three to the appointees Mr. Trump installed in those same posts when he first came to office in 2017: Jeff Sessions, a Republican senator and former judge, as attorney general; Jim Mattis, a retired Marine four-star general, as defense secretary; and Dan Coats, a longtime Republican senator from Indiana and ambassador to Germany, as director of national intelligence.</p><p>All three proved too independent for Mr. Trump. Mr. Sessions angered the president by recusing himself from the Russia investigation and refusing to help oust the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/sessions-resigns.html" title="">He was eventually fired</a>. Mr. Mattis resisted many ideas by Mr. Trump that he deemed dangerous for national security. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/jim-mattis-defense-secretary-trump.html" title="">He eventually resigned</a> to protest a decision to abandon Kurdish allies in Syria. Mr. Coats defended his intelligence analysts over their Russia conclusions and was so stunned by Mr. Trump’s deference to Mr. Putin that he privately wondered what the Russians had on the new president. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/us/politics/dan-coats-intelligence-chief-out.html" title="">He too eventually resigned</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump learned from those experiences. When he first arrived at the White House, he had not spent a single day in public office and therefore often relied on people he did not know well. He returns eight years later with a much better understanding of how power works in the White House and a better sense of whom to trust.</p><p>In the process, according to Ms. Troye, he is citing the supposed weaponization of government by the Democrats to turn it around on his adversaries. “It’s almost projection because he does exactly what he accuses these people of doing,” she said. “It’s the politicization of these communities.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
