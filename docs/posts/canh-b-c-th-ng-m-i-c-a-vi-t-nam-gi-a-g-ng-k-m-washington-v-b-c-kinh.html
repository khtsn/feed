The season that just ended was the highest grossing on record when the figures are not adjusted for inflation. But attendance remains slightly below prepandemic levels and very few musicals are achieving profitability. The season’s success was attributable in large part to three starry plays whose runs are now ending: “Good Night, and Good Luck,” “Othello” and “Glengarry Glen Ross.”</p><p>Here are some other things to know about the ceremony:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A prestigious play wins again:</strong> “Purpose,” a family drama by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/08/theater/tony-awards/tony-awards-2025?smid=url-share" title="">won the Tony for best play</a> one month after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/theater/branden-jacobs-jenkins-pulitzer-purpose.html" title="">earning a Pulitzer Prize</a>. Jacobs-Jenkins also won a Tony last year, for the play “Appropriate.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Andrew Lloyd Webber, redux:</strong> In 2023, Lloyd Webber’s decadeslong streak on Broadway ended with the closing of “The Phantom of the Opera.” But he is now allowing a new generation of directors to reimagine his older shows, and that decision was vindicated when Jamie Lloyd’s radically reconceived <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/theater/sunset-boulevard-tony-best-musical-revival.html" title="">“Sunset Boulevard” won the best musical revival prize</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The original cast of “Hamilton,” including its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, reunited with a medley of songs for the show’s 10th anniversary. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p><strong>“Hamilton” returns:</strong> Ten years after the juggernaut musical opened on Broadway, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/theater/hamilton-performance-tony-awards.html" title="">its original cast reunited to perform a medley of songs</a> on the broadcast. Inside Radio City Music Hall, the audience sang along.</p></li><li><p><strong>A mixed season for celebrities:</strong> This was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/theater/broadway-plays-hollywood-stars.html" title="">a very starry season on Broadway</a>, and several of the starry shows proved to be popular with audiences. But Denzel Washington, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons and others were overlooked by Tony nominators, and then the nominees George Clooney, Mia Farrow, Bob Odenkirk and others went home empty-handed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Politics took a back seat:</strong> The show was relatively quiet about current affairs. But not entirely. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/theater/eureka-day-review-broadway.html" title="">“Eureka Day,”</a> a comedy about left-wing anti-vaxxers, won best play revival. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/theater/english-review-broadway-toossi.html" title="">“English,”</a> a nominated play about English language learners in Iran, was described as having been prompted by the first Trump administration’s travel ban. Francis Jue, who won best featured actor in a play for his role in “Yellow Face,” said, “for those who are being targeted in these authoritarian times, I see you.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Musical moments:</strong> The ceremony was packed with musical performances. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/08/theater/tony-awards#tony-awards-cynthia-erivo-host" title="">Cynthia Erivo, the powerhouse singer who hosted</a>, led a rousing opening number, performed an In Memoriam duet with Sara Bareilles and closed with a reworked version of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” from “Dreamgirls.” Eleven musicals now running on Broadway performed in a wide range of styles — the cast of “Pirates!” strummed on washboards, while the star of “Floyd Collins” ululated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repeat victors</strong>: The actress Kara Young won a Tony for the second year in a row — this time for “Purpose” and last time for “Purlie Victorious.” And the director Michael Arden won this year for “Maybe Happy Ending” and in 2023 for “Parade.”</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Paulson is the theater reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
