The museum boasts master works from as far back as the 1400s, and Van Gogh’s irises and works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Monet and Degas have long <a href="https://www.getty.edu/art/paintings/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drawn</a> people to it. Visitors often take day trips to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/palisades-brentwood-encino-getty.html?smid=url-share" title="">Brentwood</a>, the Westside neighborhood that houses the museum, for afternoons filled with European art, modern architecture and stunning views of the city.</p><p>The museum has also described itself as <a href="https://www.getty.edu/news/why-the-getty-center-is-the-safest-place-for-art-during-a-fire/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“the safest place for art during a fire,”</a> detailing in a 2019 article the anti-fire engineering of the Getty Center, which opened in 1997. Late Saturday afternoon, Katherine E. Fleming, the chief executive of the J. Paul Getty Trust, said the Getty Center’s galleries “are safe and protected.”</p><p>In the article, the museum noted that its buildings are made of fire-resistant stone, concrete and protected steel. Surrounding it are travertine plazas and well-irrigated landscaping designed to slow down the spread of fire. The roofs are covered with fire-resistant stone aggregate.</p><p>Inside, the museum has walls of reinforced concrete or fire-protected steel and automatic fire doors that can trap fires in sealed-off areas. It has an air system designed to maintain a pressure flow to keep smoke from entering the building from outside. And there are sprinklers, but they are activated only as a last resort.</p><p>Claire Moses<!-- --> in Santa Ana, Calif., and <!-- -->Jonathan Wolfe<!-- --> in Los Angeles contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
