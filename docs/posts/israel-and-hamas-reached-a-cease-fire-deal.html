    <h1>Israel and Hamas Reached a Cease-Fire Deal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Officials representing Israel and Hamas said today that the two sides had agreed to a 42-day cease-fire that would coincide with the release of Israeli hostages who have been held captive in Gaza. The final details are still being worked out, but the tentative agreement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-deal.html" title="">raised hopes that there could soon be an end to the war</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The cease-fire is set to take effect on Sunday, according to Qatari mediators, who said that Israeli forces had agreed to withdraw to the east, away from populated areas. Some 33 of the roughly 100 remaining Israeli hostages would then be released over the course of the next 42 days. The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas.html" title="">obtained a copy of the provisional agreement</a>.</p><p>President Biden said that he was “confident” that the deal would hold, and that U.S. hostages would be released in the first phase. His aides <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/gaza-ceasefire-trump-biden.html" title="">worked closely with Donald Trump’s representatives</a> in pursuit of a cease-fire. The deal, which could be finalized as Trump takes office, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-hostage-deal-trump-inauguration-iran-1981.html" title="">is reminiscent of the 1981 Iran hostage crisis’ resolution</a>.</p><p>Officials said that the framework was similar to one publicized by Biden in late May. But one Israeli official told The Times that conditions for the deal had been created by Israel’s recent military breakthroughs, including the killing of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, in October, and the weakening of the Iran-based proxy network that supported Hamas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pam Bondi, Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, on Capitol Hill today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-70b60ecb">Bondi vowed to keep politics out of the Justice Department</h2><p>Pam Bondi, Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, promised at her confirmation hearing today that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/us/bondi-confirmation-attorney-general" title="">“politics will not play a part” in her work atop the Justice Department</a>.
