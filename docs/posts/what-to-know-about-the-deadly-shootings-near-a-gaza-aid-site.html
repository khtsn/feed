It denied reports that soldiers had also opened fire on civilians there during daylight hours.</p><p>Thousands of desperate and hungry Palestinians are coming to the new aid sites early each morning, hoping to obtain food. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid-plan.html" title="">Israeli-backed system</a> is staffed by American private contractors, who oversee the distribution of cardboard boxes of aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The United Nations and many humanitarian organizations are boycotting the endeavor, run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, criticizing its lack of independence from Israel. The U.N. and humanitarian organizations have warned that aid seekers could face danger from the Israeli military as they sought food and other aid.</p><p>Here is what to know about the situation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-10b156d7">What happened in the latest incident?</h2><p>Nebal Farsakh, a spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society, said at least some of the casualties had been the result of Israeli gunfire against civilians waiting for aid near the Netzarim Corridor. She said most of the victims had suffered shell fragments, although some also had bullet wounds.</p><p>The numbers of people killed and wounded, as reported by the Palestine Red Crescent Society and Gaza’s health ministry, ranged from a half-dozen to the hundreds, but precise figures could not be independently verified. It was also not clear if there had been more than one shooting incident in the area on Wednesday.</p><p>Officials at the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said they could not confirm the pre-dawn shootings near the Netzarim Corridor since the aid distribution center was closed at the time, and the shootings were not in the immediate vicinity of the aid center. The center was open later Wednesday, with plans to hand out more than 2 million meals throughout the day at several distribution points in Gaza, according to the foundation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-65ace25e">What happened in earlier incidents?</h2><p>Israeli soldiers opened fire on June 3 near crowds of Palestinians walking toward a new food distribution site in southern Gaza, the Israeli military said. The Red Cross and Gaza health ministry said at least 27 people were killed.</p><p>Israeli soldiers also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-distribution-site-attack.html" title="">opened fire on</a> June 1 near an approach to the same food distribution site. Palestinian officials said at least 23 people were killed.</p><p>The Israeli military said the June 3 shooting occurred about 500 yards from the distribution site, when troops fired near “a few” people who had strayed from the designated route and did not respond to “warning shots.”</p><p>The military said they had “posed a threat” to soldiers, though a spokeswoman declined to explain the nature of the perceived threat. The military said it was aware of reports of casualties and was looking into the matter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Many of the casualties from the shootings near the new group’s aid site in southern Gaza have been arriving at a field hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross in Rafah, a short distance away. On June 3, the clinic received the bodies of 19 people as well as eight others who subsequently died from their wounds, the Red Cross said in a statement.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/03/multimedia/03vid-gaza-aid-whvq/03vid-gaza-aid-whvq-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">This is the second large-scale deadly shooting in three days near the distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, where thousands of Palestinians have tried to secure aid.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>-/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The previous week, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said “nonlethal means” were used to disperse crowds at a distribution hub opened in central Gaza. On the first full day of operations, crowds overran a site in southern Gaza.</p><p>Even before the foundation began operations, other organizations had raised concerns about its approach to aid distribution.</p><p>Rather than the hundreds of aid sites previously available through the U.N. and other groups, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation only has four sites, requiring many people to walk for miles and cross Israeli military cordons to obtain aid. Most of the new sites have not been operational on most days. The sites are in southern and central Gaza, which critics said would help Israel’s attempts to displace residents from the northern part of the territory.</p><h2 id="link-17c8d340">Is any other aid getting into Gaza?</h2><p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said on June 3 that it had distributed about 107,520 boxes containing more than seven million meals. Palestinians witnesses told The Times that they saw a chaotic scramble for whatever boxes of goods were available.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The United Nations has said the group’s supplies constitute a mere trickle of assistance faced with the needs of a population of about two million people at risk of famine.</p><p>Separately from the new system, some U.N. aid trucks are still making their way through a single border crossing into southern Gaza. But U.N. officials say that distribution to warehouses and bakeries inside Gaza has been hampered by the lack of secure routes, and that negligible quantities of food are reaching the people who need it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians waiting to receive food cooked by a charity kitchen in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Issa/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>An Israeli blockade had halted food and fuel entering Gaza since March, causing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">widespread hunger</a> and deprivation among Palestinians there. Aid organizations <a href="https://wck.org/news/gaza-update-5-7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended their operations</a> as food stockpiles <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-runs-out-food-stocks-gaza-border-crossings-remain-closed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dwindled</a>. Doctors reported malnutrition among children, and the United Nations <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/risk-famine-across-all-gaza-new-report-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently warned</a> that people across the territory were at risk of famine.</p><p>Israeli officials had said the blockade was an attempt to force Hamas to surrender and release the remaining hostages held in Gaza. About 20 living hostages and the bodies of more than 30 others are believed to still be in the enclave, according to Israeli authorities. Israel says that a new aid distribution system is necessary because Hamas was diverting humanitarian aid on a grand scale — claims that could not be independently confirmed, and that the United Nations said were exaggerated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In a speech last month, Mr. Netanyahu defended the aid distribution effort, saying it would prevent Hamas from stealing supplies. The idea, he said, is to ensure that Hamas cannot loot aid and use it as a tool of war. He also said the plan was “eventually, to have a sterile zone in the south of Gaza where the entire population can move for its own protection.”</p><h2 id="link-7cd27f8">What is the status of Palestinians in Gaza?</h2><p>In northern Gaza, cut off by Israeli troops from the rest of the territory, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/middleeast/gaza-children-hunger.html" title="">hundreds of thousands of people</a> are reduced to waiting for hours for charity-kitchen food that runs out too soon and to digging boreholes for water to drink, unsanitary though it might be.</p><p>People struggle to find fuel for hospital generators, cars and cooking stoves. Families have resorted to burning wood or even trash.</p><p>The vast majority of Gaza’s residents have already been forcibly displaced at least once — many of them several times — during the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-2fcceaf3">How many people have been killed in Gaza?</h2><p>Before announcing a renewed ground offensive in May, Israel had started ratcheting up its bombardment of Gaza. Israeli strikes have killed hundreds of people since mid-May, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people since mid-May, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The Israeli military says it takes measures to avoid harming civilians, such as using “precise munitions” and giving advance warning of some strikes.</p><p>More than 55,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war, according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas set off the conflict with a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages to Gaza.</p><p>Isabel Kershner<!-- -->, <!-- -->Natan Odenheimer<!-- -->, Lara Jakes and <!-- -->Patrick Kingsley<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
