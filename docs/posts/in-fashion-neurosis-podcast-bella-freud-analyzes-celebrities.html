It was not long after founding her fashion label in 1990 that Ms. Freud released a successful line of slogan sweaters bearing the logo “Psychoanalysis.” Later, she would introduce a Psychoanalysis fragrance, an eau de parfum with combined notes of tobacco flower, cedar wood, amber and musk. Now she adds to her pseudo-Freudian canon that 21st-century inevitability, a podcast.</p><p>“Fashion Neurosis” is a series of 30-minute sessions that mimic classic therapeutic practice in both essence and detail. A clock ticks. A doorbell rings. A disembodied voice through an intercom says “come in.” A subject is buzzed into Ms. Freud’s “studio,” and an interview takes place on a couch. Sitting near the analysand, an unseen Ms. Freud begins the session.</p><p>“I wanted to talk to people who didn’t really talk a lot,” Ms. Freud said last week by phone from London, referring to guests on the podcast like the designer Rick Owens, the actress Courteney Cox, the retired French soccer star Eric Cantona, the former Sonic Youth frontwoman Kim Gordon and the model Kate Moss. On the face of it, these people would seem to be so famous their lives no longer hold many secrets. That is before we learn some of their innermost thoughts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Ostensibly, I ask questions through the prism of clothes,” said Ms. Freud, 63. “But clothes are just a way to start the conversation.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Freud uses clothes as a jumping-off point before diving into other issues with her guests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fashion Neurosis With Bella Freud</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Clothes are little more than a jumping-off point for Mr. Owens to reminisce about his fleshy boyhood body and how it would eventually transform, over decades of daily work at the gym, into a chiseled physique that stands out in the world of fashion.</p><p>Gazing at the ceiling, or a ceiling-mounted camera, Mr. Owens, 62, seems to float in consciousness as he muses that the body dysmorphia he experienced in childhood might have contributed to a later-life propensity for designing clothes that often treat human anatomy as an afterthought. “Distortion and exaggeration is always what I’m going for,” he said. “Distorting the human figure is so much more profound than doing an embroidery that takes 7,000 hours.”</p><p>Mr. Cantona’s storied soccer career — most memorably with Manchester United — was often marred by controversy, as in a 1995 away match against Crystal Palace. Angered by a referee who had sent him off the field, Mr. Cantona launched a wild kick into the crowd, striking a Crystal Palace fan. He was later tried and convicted of criminal assault, though his conviction was overturned on appeal. It was less the incident itself that came to define Mr. Cantona, who eventually did 120 hours of community service, than a single gnomic statement he made at a news conference after the game.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“When the seagulls follow the trawler, it’s because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea,” he said, walking off without another word.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the first episode of “Fashion Neurosis,” Mr. Owens discussed how his childhood body played a role in shaping his career and his current physique.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fashion Neurosis With Bella Freud</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I’ve always loved that statement,” Ms. Freud said. Although no soccer fan (“I don’t know anything about football’’), she admired what she called Mr. Cantona’s “uncompromising, poetic, irreverent and philosophical” manner. This is on ample display in “Fashion Neurosis,” where the soccer star, now middle-aged, ruminates in surprisingly earnest ways on his desire to exit the trap of celebrity existence to commune with nature.</p><p>“Initially,” Ms. Freud said, “when I was playing with ideas for a podcast, I wanted it to be like a chat show, but very, very short. Then, when I thought more about all the people I’d like to talk to and how if someone is on a couch and I’m in a chair, we can be in any room, we came up with ‘Fashion Neurosis.’ I realized it was a way to learn vicariously all the things I’ve secretly wanted to know.”</p><p>For fans of Ms. Moss, “Fashion Neurosis” was a means of revealing that bewitching experience, well known among those in the supermodel’s inner circle, of “being Mossed,” where she charms those in her orbit into staying out long past their bedtimes. The podcast was also a way to dispel simplistic “Devil Wears Prada” myths about the richly dimensioned fashion world and — countertransference would probably be the right word here — to unearth Ms. Freud’s own deep-seated motives for doing what she does.</p><p>“If I had had a perfect body, I would never have become a designer,” Ms. Freud recently wrote in an Instagram post. “My insecurities and self-doubt are what propelled me into the world of creating clothes, as a foil for my dissatisfaction and frustration with my appearance.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Guy Trebay is a reporter for the Style section of The Times, writing about the intersections of style, culture, art and fashion.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/guy-trebay">More about Guy Trebay</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
