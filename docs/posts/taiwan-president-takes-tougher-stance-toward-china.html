The contention has taken on a sharper edge since Mr. Lai declared on March 13 that China was a “foreign hostile force” exploiting Taiwan’s freedoms to “divide, destroy, and subvert us from within.”</p><p>He <a href="https://english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/6919" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laid out 17 steps to fight back</a>, including restoring military courts to try Taiwanese military personnel accused of espionage and other security crimes. He wants to more closely monitor Taiwanese people’s contacts with China to stop what he said was Beijing’s political exploitation of religious, educational and cultural exchanges. He demanded greater disclosure about Taiwanese politicians who visit China. Many such politicians belong to the opposition Nationalist Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We have no choice but to take even more proactive measures,” Mr. Lai said.</p><p>Beijing despises Mr. Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party, accusing them of being separatists. Chinese officials quickly denounced Mr. Lai’s speech, especially his use of the term “foreign hostile force.” Taiwan’s opposition Nationalist Party, which favors ties and talks with China, accused Mr. Lai needlessly fanning tensions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An image released by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense showing Taiwanese military personnel preparing a naval fast mine-laying boat at an undisclosed location in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Taiwan Ministry of Defense/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Specifically singling out mainland China and the Chinese Communist Party is to some degree a provocation,” <a href="https://www.ly.gov.tw/EngPages/List.aspx?nodeid=55306" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hsu Chiao-hsin</a>, a prominent Nationalist lawmaker, said in an interview. “This will trigger even more tensions across the strait.”</p><p>Nationalist politicians said they would resist at least some of Mr. Lai’s proposed steps. They argue that reinstating <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23698791" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military courts</a>, which were abolished in 2013 after protests over abuses of soldiers, is backsliding. “Many of these 17 steps restrict people’s civil rights,” Mrs. Hsu said.</p><p><a href="https://www.ly.gov.tw/EngPages/List.aspx?nodeid=55311" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ko Chih-en</a>, another Nationalist Party legislator, accused Mr. Lai of unfairly casting his domestic critics as “red” tools of Beijing. “Don’t make it like anyone with any connection to China is given a red hat so that everyone is in fear.”</p><p>The rising political acrimony could further complicate Mr. Lai’s plans, including perhaps most crucially a proposed increase in military spending meant to mollify Washington. President Trump and his team <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/asia/taiwan-trump-us-support.html" title="">have said that Taiwan</a> should sharply raise its defense budget, to as much as 10 percent of its economy, up from the current budgeted 2.45 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Lai <a href="https://english.president.gov.tw/News/6908" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed last month</a> to use an additional “special budget” later this year to push overall defense spending to more than 3 percent of the economy. But the increase must win approval from Taiwan’s legislature, where the Nationalists and a smaller party, the Taiwan People’s Party, hold a majority.</p><p>Mr. Lai may be thinking that despite their anger at him, Taiwan’s opposition parties will ultimately back the planned increase in military spending, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/david-sacks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Sacks</a> said.</p><p>“I think that part of Lai’s calculus is also that if the opposition played games with his proposed defense spending increase, that would get Washington’s attention in a way they really don’t want,” Mr. Sacks said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Legislators from the opposition Nationalist Party during debate over the central government budget for 2025 in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cheng Yu-Chen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>When Taiwan’s main annual budget passed this year, the opposition imposed cuts and conditions that Mr. Lai’s government said would hamper government operations. The opposition parties have said the cuts were aimed at wasteful spending, and Taiwan’s military preparedness would not be hurt by their measures.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“My sense is that President Lai will eventually be able to get a special budget passed by the legislature, but at some political costs,” said <a href="https://globaltaiwan.org/member/russell-hsiao/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russell Hsiao</a>, the executive director of the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington.<strong><em> </em></strong>“The opposition parties will make him and the ruling party pay a political price, even though, eventually, they will go along with it — in part because they know that Washington is paying close attention.”</p><p>Negotiations over the special budget could be protracted and tense, even if both sides generally agree on more military spending, said <a href="https://www.pf.org.tw/en/pfen/30.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Raymond Cheng-en Sung</a>, the vice president of the Prospect Foundation, a government-funded institute in Taipei. “The limited window of opportunity that we have for getting this done could still vanish,” Mr. Sung said.</p><p>Several Nationalist lawmakers, including Richard Yeong-Kang Chen, a former admiral, said they broadly supported a rise in military spending. But the polarized atmosphere made legislative give-and-take harder, Mr. Chen said. Like most opposition politicians, he blamed Mr. Lai for the impasse. Mr. Lai’s side blames obstruction by the opposition parties.</p><p>“Putting it harshly, there’s virtually no communication now between the two parties,” Mr. Chen said of the Nationalists and Mr. Lai’s Democratic Progressive Party.</p><p>Mr. Lai won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/13/world/asia/taiwan-election-china-us.html" title="">40 percent of the vote</a> in the presidential election last year, but his party lost its majority in the legislature, resulting in frequent standoffs over Mr. Lai’s initiatives. <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2024/05/18/2003818026" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brawls have broken</a> out in Taiwan’s legislative chamber, and opponents of the Nationalist Party and Taiwan People’s Party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/asia/taiwan-protest-fight.html" title="">staged protests</a> outside the legislative building last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of President Lai Ching-te at a protest in Taipei last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false"> YASUYOSHI CHIBA/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Hoping to weaken the opposition parties’ grip on the legislature, Mr. Lai’s Democratic Progressive Party has <a href="https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/03/20/taiwans-democratic-uncertainty-in-the-face-of-recall-elections/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backed a recall</a> campaign against opposition lawmakers, using a rule that members of the legislature can face fresh elections, outside of the usual cycle, if enough voters sign petitions. The The Nationalist Party has, in turn, backed recall petitions against D.P.P. lawmakers.</p><p>Mr. Lai’s recent speech on China appeared partly intended to sharpen the contrast with the opposition, said <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/ryan-hass/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan Hass</a>, an expert on China and Taiwan at the Brookings Institution. “I think it was intended to reassert control of the narrative, to put people who are opposing his agenda on the back foot,” Mr. Hass said in an interview while visiting Taipei.</p><p>Still, he and many other experts say Taiwan does face growing efforts by China to illicitly influence public opinion on the island, erode confidence in its government and military forces, and to collect intelligence.</p><p>Mr. Lai said the growing threat from China was reflected in the data: 64 people faced charges of espionage in Taiwan in 2024, he said, three times the number charged with the offense in 2021.</p><p>Most of those accused of spying, Mr. Lai said, were former or current members of Taiwan’s armed forces.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Musk Effect:</strong> Elon Musk is seemingly everywhere, dominating the news out of Washington and beyond.
