There’s been the official one, with all of its pomp and its pageantry. The one we call the peaceful transition of power. The state of the vote for the President of the United States. I watched Vice President Kamala Harris preside over the certification of the election. She lost. I watched President Joe Biden welcome his successor, President Donald Trump, back to the White House. The honorable William J. Clinton I watched every living former president assemble under the Capitol rotunda to honor Trump’s second inauguration. What a difference this inauguration was to four years ago, when a mob had just stormed the Capitol. When Trump sought to append the election results and upon failing, did not attend Joe Biden’s inauguration. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. This transition, the official transition of presidential power, has been orderly. But there has been this other transition happening to a transition not of power, but of political system, a transition in the rules and expectations of power. There’s breaking news from the White House tonight. President Biden has pardoned his son, Hunter Biden. For months, the president insisted he would not do. The blowback is certainly coming from all directions for President Biden. And it isn’t just Republicans that are crying hypocrisy. I understood Joe Biden’s pardon of Hunter Biden. Hunter had become a particular fixation of the Trumpist right. Hunter Biden is guilty of human sex trafficking, and we have the receipts, Mr Biden, and the idea that they would unleash their revenge on him individually seemed all too real. Joe Biden has already lost two children. Others may disagree. I had trouble begrudging him his refusal to lose a third. President Biden leaves the White House with a flurry of 11th hour pardons. But then came so many more pardons, culminating in pardons of Anthony Fauci and much of Biden’s family. It’s going to set a terrible precedent. And it wasn’t just pardons. There was the refusal to enforce the ban on TikTok that Biden himself had signed into law. And alongside that came the bizarre decision to announce that the equal Rights Amendment was now ratified, as Virginia had accepted it in 2020, becoming the 38th state to do so. Today, I affirm the equal Rights Amendment to have cleared all the necessary hurdles to be added to the US Constitution. Now, the equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land Now. But that wasn’t true. It wasn’t ratified. Congress had set a deadline of 1982 for ratification. The opinion of Biden’s own Justice Department is that Virginia’s late act is meaningless. The era is not ratified, and the Biden administration knows it’s not ratified. All this was just an effort to make the president seem more powerful, more consequential than he really was. And why did it wait until the final days of his presidency. Changing the Constitution under a controversial theory is not what you do on your way out the door. The Biden of 2020 would have done none of this in key cases like the family pardons. He said he would not do this, and then he did it. This feels, in its own way Biden’s submission to the new regime. The powers of the presidency are whatever the president can get away with. I’m not naive. I recognize that presidents have been testing the limits of their authority since the dawn of the Republic. But for a president like Biden, whose core message was about the preservation of America’s constitutional democracy, and not just that, but the informal system of norms and values and behaviors that scaffolds that system. But for that President to leave in this way was a profound statement of its own. Maybe the message was cynicism. Maybe it was acceptance because it is clear that things are to be done differently now. The beginning of Donald Trump’s second term certainly revealed a president who intends to govern based on what he can get away with. Trump announced immediately that he was declaring birthright citizenship invalid, unilaterally changing the clear language of the Constitution and daring the courts to stop him. He’s giving TikTok a reprieve from the clean language of the law, so he can figure out a way to save it. He is pardoning the January 6 rioters. He’s renaming the Gulf of Mexico to be the Gulf of America, and Denali to be Mount McKinley. I was struck in Trump’s inaugural address how almost everything mentioned was an executive action that Trump would take and the courts would decide to accept or reject. He talked little of laws. He wanted to persuade Congress to pass. What interest Trump is, what he can do alone. And watching Trump take the oath of office from the good seats were the CEOs of the major platforms who control America’s attention. There was Elon Musk, the owner of X and Tesla Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of alphabet. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. And a bit further back was, the CEO of TikTok. For all Trump’s talk of manufacturing jobs and auto plants and infrastructure, the CEOs of GM and GE and Ford and Caterpillar were not in that room. This wasn’t just an assemblage of America’s rich. It was our intentional oligarchy assembled before Trump. All this came just days after the Trump family launched a crypto coin in their own name a meme coin, you can’t spend it. It’s just a way to invest in Trump’s fortunes. To invest in Trump. To make him richer. The meme coin shot to more than $70, and the Trump family and its partners seem to own about 80 percent of the coins, making their holdings worth notionally tens of billions of dollars. And then Melania Trump. She launched her own meme coin, which also shot up, although it seemed to harm the value of the Trump meme coin. This is all insane to even try to describe. But Melania’s meme coin comes after she sold her biopic and another project she’s an executive producer on both to Amazon for $40 million. The scale of the graph and the grift right now is astonishing, and it’s all out in the open. It’s not like politics is free of corruption in 2018 or 2022. But this is a new era of brazenness, of cashing in on power. And who’s going to stop Trump and his family. Who’s going to tell them no. We talk about America’s system of government as if it is a solid thing bound by the Constitution and institutions, the way a belt cinches around a waist. But it’s really just a pile of norms in a trench coat. Knock the norms down and everything changes. I can imagine what we’re seeing, leading to backlash. I don’t think it’s safe. I don’t think it’s good politics to rub America’s face in this much oligarchy and corruption. I could also see it leading to a consolidation of power as Trump and his allies unite to protect their power, unite to help each other, as has happened in so many other countries. But we are either way entering a new era. Power did not just pass from one president to another. It passed from one regime to another, one set of rules to another. And you can see it. So clearly because the old regime ended even before the new one began.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/22/podcasts/22eks-inauguration/22eks-inauguration-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Ezra Klein discusses the oligarchic power dynamics of the second Trump administration.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Photo Illustration by The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p><em>This is an edited transcript of an episode of “The Ezra Klein Show.” You can listen to the conversation by following or subscribing to the show on the </em><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyt-audio/id1549293936" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>NYT Audio App</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1548604447" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Apple</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3oB5noYIwEB2dMAREj2F7S" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/c4a3b1da-5433-49e6-8c14-0e1da53be78c/the-ezra-klein-show" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Amazon Music</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxuOd8obvLLtf5_-YKFbiQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/326-the-ezra-klein-show-31142409/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>iHeartRadio</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/opinion/how-to-listen-ezra-klein-show-nyt.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em>wherever you get your podcasts</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>I feel I have been watching two different presidential transitions take place.</p><p>There has been the official one, with all of its pomp and pageantry.

The E.R.A. is not ratified. And the Biden administration knows it. Biden did not direct the archivist of the United States to officially add the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, and she, quite reasonably, did not.</p><p>All of this was bizarre — a substitution of press stunt for policy process, an effort to make the president seem more powerful than he really was. And why did it wait until the final days of his presidency? If it was so worth doing, then do it earlier and defend it. Changing the Constitution, under a controversial theory, is not what you do on your way out the door.</p><p>The Biden of 2020 would have done none of this.

For all Donald Trump’s talk of manufacturing jobs and auto plants and infrastructure, the chief executives of General Motors, General Electric, Ford and Caterpillar were not in that room. This wasn’t just an assemblage of America’s rich. It was our attentional oligarchy — assembled before Trump.</p><p>This came just days after the Trump family launched a crypto coin in their own name — a memecoin. You can’t spend it. This isn’t a currency or a piece of decentralized financial infrastructure meant to offer services to the unbanked or commerce to the metaverse, it’s just a way to invest in Trump’s fortunes, and invest in Trump.

This is how democracy has backslid in so many other countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But we’re entering a new era. Power did not just pass from one president to another. It passed from one regime to another, one set of rules to another. And you can see it so clearly because the old regime ended even before the new one began.</p><p>Joining me now to talk about the inauguration and what we are seeing as Trump begins his second presidential term is my editor, Aaron Retica.</p></div></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-10"><figure><figcaption><div><h3>The New Rules of the Trump Era</h3><p><span>Ezra Klein and Aaron Retica discuss the oligarchic power dynamics of the second Trump administration.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Ezra Klein: Aaron, welcome back to the show.</strong></p><p><strong>Aaron Retica:</strong> Thank you very much. Great to be here.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>Where do you want to start?</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>There’s a million things to talk about, but let’s start here: We have a better idea today, 24 hours into the second Trump administration, about what they mean by “making America great again.” So what’s great? What are they trying to achieve?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Klein: </strong>I’ve been thinking: Let’s imagine you make $75,000. You live in Columbus, Ohio. You have three kids. You’ve been frustrated by prices — eggs are expensive. What problems of yours did he offer to solve at the inauguration?</p><p>I was struck by how much Make America Great Again was about renegotiating who is or can be an American. Under the proposed birthright citizenship executive order, Kamala Harris might not be a citizen. So there is a fight over what Joe Biden used to call the soul of America.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>You said “proposed.” But of course, that’s the crazy part, right? It is an executive order. It’s proposed in the sense that they know it’s going to be fought.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>Yes, it seems to be unconstitutional. But this is their assertion: that they will no longer respect birthright citizenship. They will direct the agencies that give you things like social security numbers to not give those numbers.</p><p>From the beginning, the biggest thing they are doing is changing who gets to be — who is, on some level — an American. The longtime liberal view about Donald Trump and Make America Great Again — that their fundamental question is about belonging — is proving true.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>And then there was a lot of other stuff in there related to Trump and his personal resentments, weaponization of the government, that kind of thing. There was a pardoning of the Jan. 6 rioters.</p><p>But in terms of actually solving the problems of normal people — about your health care, about your prices, about your commute — for all the talk that Trump at some point understood that he won on the price of groceries, there was not a lot here about the price of groceries.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>They would say that “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/energy-environment/trump-oil-gas.html" title="">Drill, baby drill</a>” and what they’re going to do with gas and energy is one of the things that’s going to affect prices in a way that will make people happy. That would be their argument, presumably.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>There was some talk about increasing energy production. And I’m sure they will try, though we’re already at record levels.</p><p>I guess it’s worth asking: Is there anything here that is different than what they thought eight years ago? We just went through a long inflationary period. People are upset about things like prices. Is there a new problem being solved?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Trump talks a lot about crime and safety. Even if you want to say that he’s doing something on that by naming some of these cartels terrorist organizations and directing the U.S. government to increase enforcement against undocumented immigrants who commit crimes — most crimes are not committed by immigrants. This was not the announcement that they’re going to be sending to Congress — a large, new bill managing police forces.</p><p>Look, I don’t want to be faux-naïf here. Everybody knows that Donald Trump is not superdetailed around most policies. But even the tariffs were absent. They’re going to create this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-tariffs-external-revenue-service.html" title="">External Revenue Service</a> to have America study the question of what kinds of tariffs might make sense to put on.</p><p>Make America Great Again is about who belongs. It is about excluding people who are currently in the definition of America, and it is about restoring a masculine, dominant, backed-by-force sense of our destiny. We will control the Panama Canal again. We will have Greenland, and we’ll begin adding to the American imperium again. We will put our flag on Mars.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>OK, let’s take these things one at a time. Let’s stay with birthright citizenship. Even though we knew it was coming, it’s still worth stopping and talking directly about what this is.</p><p>They’re talking about the most obvious thing, which is that the children of undocumented immigrants would not automatically be American citizens. But they are also talking about what some people are calling the Kamala Harris clause, which is that if you’re a student here — a graduate student, a medical student, whatever — and you have a child here right now, that child is automatically an American citizen. That’s out in their executive order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>I’m really struck by the way you said “proposed,” as though it were legislation. They know there’s going to be this battle. They intend to end birthright citizenship. But do you think that they think they can? Or is this like the new Roe? Is this something that they’re going to always have on the edge of expectation — that actually can’t be done — that they can motivate their base with?</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>Though Roe eventually got done.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>I know Roe did get done — absolutely.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>I think the central question for the Trump administration right now is: What will this court that they built let them get away with — or give them the power to do? This court that they built got rid of Roe, which many people thought was, if not impossible, very unlikely.</p><p>So the idea that the law that we understood to be settled in 1996 or 2006 or even 2016 — it’s not settled now. And there are things in the current system that I think reasonably offend people. The idea of birth tourism is reasonably offensive — that people pay to come here and have a child, and that child is a citizen. And that is being advertised as a way of getting around a loophole.</p><p>You hear them use the term “invasion.” There’s an understood-in-the-law carveout for the question of invasion. And what the law and the Supreme Court texts are attempting to do there is to say: Well, look, if during World War II, Germany had sent an invading force to the American homeland and we had eventually repelled them, not every member of the German infantry who had a child here during that period — it would be crazy to say they’re all citizens just because they’re on the territory. So the idea is: Can you say that the people coming here, legally or illegally, are an invasion and they’re carved out? That’s one question.</p><p>Then there’s this question of temporary residence — someone who is here on, say, a student visa. That’s much more sympathetic. But you could also imagine them putting student visas up as something that maybe the court will strike out — so something like: You can’t come here as an undocumented immigrant or for birth tourism and have a child and expect to have citizenship. But you could be here on a student visa and expect to have citizenship. And you can imagine a world in which what they believe might happen is that the courts would split the difference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>So much of the early executive orders is about testing a question they don’t know the answer to: Given this Supreme Court: How much power does this president have? They understand that their power in Congress is quite limited. The Republican House majority is the smallest House majority since the Great Depression — at five seats. Republicans have a 53 to 47 cut in the Senate that does not give them the ability to go over the filibuster.</p><p>So it’s going to be difficult and frustrating to do legislation. And I don’t think Donald Trump likes doing legislation anyway. So the question is: How much can he be king? What can he do himself?</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>The case you were referring to, <a href="https://www.tpt.org/american-experience-2/video/chinese-exclusion-act-wong-kim-ark-6ynevh/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United States v. Wong Kim Ark</a>, is from 1898. I won’t go into the details of the case, but the gist of it is that a guy who was born in San Francisco went to visit his parents in China and tried to come back to the U.S. He was blocked and then eventually was granted the right to stay here because he was a citizen.</p><p>The court that decided that was also, more or less, the court that decided Plessy v. Ferguson. This is not some kind of Warren liberal court. So even if they imagine that they have some sort of capture of the Supreme Court, which they do, it’s a little hard to imagine them doing that. But again, we don’t know.</p><p>And as you said, maybe it’s all horse-trading. Everything is a deal, right? So even law is a deal. We’re going to propose X number of things, and we’re seeing —</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>Klein: </strong>And even the debate is a win, in a way. Birthright citizenship is — what they have put back on the table is who is an American and who should be an American.</p><p>And you’ve seen different versions of this. You saw it with JD Vance and the way he was talking about Haitian immigrants during the campaign. They are here legally, but he was describing the authority under which they are here as incorrectly decided — illegally offered.</p><p>They don’t like legal immigration, either. They shut down the Border Patrol application, which the Biden administration began, which had people standing in line.</p><p>There are videos of people screaming and crying after finding out that their meeting — a meeting they had jumped through all of these hoops to schedule — had just been canceled 20 minutes before it was supposed to happen. And these are the people who are doing it the right way — who were standing in line, who were giving the biometric data.</p><p>What they want to do is raise, as a fundamental question, Who is an American? And even if you lose at the court, maybe you still win partially in public opinion. If you can turn more and more people against the system as it exists, if you can call more and more people’s citizenship and the legitimacy of their belonging into question, that is a win for the spiritual core of Trumpism — which is that we have been invaded and America isn’t America anymore. It is no longer great, because we have let too many of these other people in here.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>And I will also say: The birthright citizenship move — that’s the shock-and-awe part of this campaign. But behind it, they’re doing a lot.</p><p>One thing I do think you see is Trump is always a good marketer. I think he played his first day incredibly well. The signing of the executive orders in public — he didn’t sign all of them in public, but he had this rally, and he was throwing the pens out to the crowd. I mean, it had everything but a T-shirt cannon.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>That will be for the third Trump term.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>Right. A big part of everything right now is Trump persuading his own people, the demoralized and dispirited Democratic opposition and the rest of the world that he is strong. That he is coming in with momentum. That they are doing a lot all at once. And whether or not you see anything changing, the vibe will be that things are changing.</p><p>In some ways I think it will be the opposite of how a lot of things felt under Joe Biden, where you had huge pieces of legislation happening. But it was so discordant with the sense of torpor in the administration, the kind of quiet shuffling image of the president — that the energy that was happening legislatively never translated to a spirit of energy.</p><p>MAGA is not just about who’s an American. It’s about strength. And strength is something that America both shows on the world stage and also something that has to be embodied in its leader. Trump, within his own coalition, is understood as this somewhat mythic embodiment of the national spirit. And who knows what he does with that?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>My favorite line of his inauguration is his saying that he’ll be partially judged in the wars that do not begin. The best possible thing that can happen with Donald Trump, in my view, is that it really embeds in his self-conception that he is a person who ends wars and, through his own strength, keeps more from starting. That would be great if we don’t have crazy foreign adventures under Donald Trump.</p><p>These are all executive orders, so we’ll see what stands. But they are doing, in many ways, less than meets the eye because so much of this will not actually stand. And many of these executive orders are just messaging anyway. Bring down prices — as an executive order, that doesn’t get you anywhere. There is this sense of energy of: OK, somebody is back in control and doing something.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>He says he doesn’t want wars. But he did talk about territorial expansion.</p><p>Europe went unmentioned in the Inaugural Address. But as you said, he did talk about the Panama Canal. There’s obviously been a lot of chatter about Greenland. He’s talked about Canada. He’s talked about Mexico. So it’s a North American continent — plus whatever we want to do in South America.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>And Mars.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>Plus Mars. [Laughs.] Exactly. So it’s manifest destiny, a man of destiny and whatever we call the destiny of Mars. But what do you see him doing with all of this?</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>I think a way to ask this question is: Why is Donald Trump’s mind fastening on the question of Greenland, of the Panama Canal?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>Retica: </strong>It’s because he believes in climate change. [Laughs.]</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>Right. I think there’s a reason those things appeal to him in the way they do, and I don’t actually think it’s about shipping lanes and critical minerals. There are a lot of ways to think about shipping lanes and critical minerals. I know a lot of people who think very seriously about them, and neither the Panama Canal nor Greenland are high up on their list of concerns.</p><p>But if you were sitting down and saying: Well, what are the best things we can do for American shipping? Donald Trump is agreeing with the dockworkers who are trying to fight automation and productivity improvements. If you want to help American shipping, you can make our shipping much more efficient. You can come up with all these deals with other countries to give us more and more preferential access to different routes.</p><p>If you’re worried about minerals, there are a million ways that we might want to go get minerals that are a lot easier than getting into a lot of negotiations with Greenland’s Indigenous population about whether or not they should become part of America. There’s no guarantee that getting Greenland to vote to become part of America, even if you can do that, is going to make for easy access to their natural resources.</p><p>So what is fastening his mind on this? I think that this fits with a certain self-perception he has developed — and so many of the people around him have developed — of what America has lost. It’s part of this whole shift toward a much more masculine and aggressive energy in this version of Trumpism.</p><p>I think you can look at MAGA — and this is an argument that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/opinion/donald-trump-tech-musk-bannon.html" title="">James Pogue made in a very good piece for The Times</a> — as a strange mixture of 19th century nativist American movements and things that are looking toward being 22nd century — like interplanetary American imperial movements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p><strong>Retica: </strong>Right. So on one side you have Stephen Miller and Stephen Bannon and all those people, and on the other side you have all these tech people.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>Yes, there’s the question of renaming Denali to Mount McKinley. Which is fine — but there’s a sense of: Who cares? And there’s a question of planting the American flag on Mars. And he’s trying to unite both.</p><p>It’s a retrofuturist view: America lost this energy — this daring, this courage, this aggression. It’s become a country of weenies and immigrants. America has become soft. That’s the looking back.</p><p>And then there are all these futurists — Marc Andreessen, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others around Donald Trump. And now many of them staffing inside the administration who are also looking toward these questions of A.I. dominance, of interplanetary travel. And they have different views on immigration. So there are some schisms, or at least tensions, within the coalition.</p><p>But what Donald Trump wants, I think, is to make America bigger and more feared and more dominant again. I don’t think he cares so much about the imperium as he does care about the sense that we cannot be stopped, told what to do, held back. He wants America to act like him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p><strong>Retica: </strong>Let’s stay with the tech people for a minute. There they were, right in the front. Governor Greg Abbott, of Texas, was in the overflow room. Governor Ron DeSantis, of Florida, was in the overflow room.</p><p>A message was clearly being sent. What’s happening there?</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>I do think Donald Trump understands that attention is the new money. Attention is the fundamental substance of power in American politics.</p><p>Here’s what I think is happening here: I have been one of the people using the term “oligarchic” for the structure that is emerging. And one criticism I’ve heard of that, that I’ve been trying to think about and take seriously was: Well, you weren’t calling Bezos and Zuckerberg and them oligarchic when they were much more Biden- or Hillary Clinton- or Barack Obama-coded. Is oligarchic just the term you use when rich people support Republicans or support Trump?</p><p>So I’ve been trying to think about: Is this just motivated reasoning on my own part and the part of other liberals?</p><p>And I don’t think it is. I didn’t call the coalition of rich people around Trump oligarchs in 2017. There were rich people who supported him — the Adelsons and so on — but it didn’t strike me that there was a deal being made in which money would give them rulership. The word “oligarchic” comes from the word that means “to rule.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>So first and foremost, what I would say has been most different — the thing that has me thinking most about oligarchy — is Elon Musk. In putting his money and attentional power in service of Trump to a very large degree and then being at the Trump rallies, he has become clearly the most influential other figure in the Trump administration.</p><p>The deal has not just been that maybe Trump listens to him a bit on policy. It’s that he becomes a kind of co-ruler. I’m not saying he’s literally the co-president —</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>Stephen Miller is still very important.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>But Musk has developed an influence and a control that is very different.</p><p>So that relationship between the two of them — what Musk is able to buy with his support — is a kind of power that is nothing like what Jeffrey Katzenberg or George Soros or George Clooney or any of these other people had. Or, even as far as I can tell, really wanted.</p><p>There’s also a tit for tat that has emerged, where, if you anger Trump, he will at least discuss using the power of the government to really harm you. A couple of months ago, he was talking about putting Mark Zuckerberg in jail. He said that he should be in jail — maybe for life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>Jeff Bezos clearly had some real problems with the Trump administration. Jeff Bezos has many interests that are before the Trump administration. But now if you turn, you will be so welcomed that you’ll actually be there in that row at inauguration.</p><p>So again, the sort of deal of if you put your resources at his disposal, if you move your policy in his direction, if you come out for him, you don’t just get some good treatment, you get real power. You don’t just get to be heard, you get to potentially be part of ruling. Marc Andreessen, who was another early tech guy, has been incredibly influential in the transition. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/david-sacks-crypto-ai-trump.html" title="">David Sacks</a>.</p><p>I’m not saying that Democrats do not give ambassadorships and things to the people who support them. But this entering into a coalitional government with these tech billionaires — it feels very different.</p><p>And obviously everything is a matter of degree. Money was a problem four years ago. It was a problem eight years ago. And one thing that annoys me about Republicans saying, “Oh, you’re complaining about this now” — it’s like, well, no, actually.</p><p>Like most liberals, I’ve complained about money in politics forever and have supported every bill that has come up to reduce its power. And Republicans have killed all those bills. So that’s another piece of it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>TikTok is another piece of it. Somebody with a very big stake in TikTok, who’s very rich, went to Trump. That seems to have been what led to Trump’s flipping on TikTok. And now TikTok is putting up these notices: Oh, President Trump is going to save us, and we thank him, and we’re looking forward to working with him.</p><p>But imagine if, in the 2026 or 2028 election, TikTok — and possibly the Chinese Communist Party behind it — is worried about Democrats getting power. What if they begin turning the dials on what goes viral on TikTok?</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>There are these studies that show that if you post about the Uyghurs, the embattled Muslim minority in China, you will disappear on TikTok. Whereas on other platforms, the post shows up.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>Maybe pro-Trump content just does a little bit better.</p><p>I’ve talked to many people who know high-up people at TikTok. I’ve done some reporting here. I was writing about TikTok in 2022. And people will say: Yeah, we don’t have access to the whole system. A lot of it is controlled from China.</p><p>So what feels different to me about this second Trump administration is that these tech C.E.O.s get the ability to help rule in the Trump administration. But then the other side of it is: You’re going to use these attentional platforms to help consolidate the power of Donald Trump and MAGA.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>And I recognize that some of my friends on the right will say: Well, that’s what content moderation looked like to us when Donald Trump was banned by these different platforms for trying to foment mob violence on them.</p><p>And I think it is different. I can understand the view that it isn’t. But there was nothing like the role that Elon Musk is playing and — in playing it, has shown other billionaires that they can play — being offered.</p><p>And the final thing I’ll say on this is that part of this reflects Donald Trump’s own ideological flexibility — that the boundaries on what someone could ask of Joe Biden, of Kamala Harris, of Barack Obama, of George W. Bush were just narrower. Because they were part of ideologically programmatic parties.</p><p>So this trade of power for attention — it feels potent and frightening to me. And the visual of it at the inauguration — with these other kinds of power centers, like the governors, sitting in worse seats: I think a lot of how to understand the Trump administration is visual, is aesthetic, is marketing. It’s something that displays what it is in public.</p><p>They really went to some length to display what they were in public. I think we should believe them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p><strong>Retica: </strong>Even if you believe in some kind of futurist A.I. paradise, just seeing them lined up there — it’s so far from the guy in Ohio. It’s literally the three richest men in the world — and they are all men — lined up like that. I have to say, I found it totally grotesque. I’m less sympathetic than you are to all this. Like, the futurist aspect of it: I fear it more.</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>I do want to keep saying, though: I think that Democrats keep — maybe understandably, maybe it’s even good politics — wanting to jam this into the box of plutocrats. But what made it this set of people was not that they were billionaires. Sundar Pichai was there. The C.E.O. of TikTok was there. What got them there was their control of attention. These are attentional billionaires. These are attentional oligarchs.</p><p>I was saying this in my episode with Chris Hayes: I think Democrats still think the fundamental substance of political power is money. And Republicans under Trump believe it is attention. And I think they are closer to right. So the alliances and deals they are trying to cut have more to do with attention.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>The distinction I always like to make — and I stole this from someone, but God knows who: People always talk about taking power. But you don’t take it — you make it. And this is how it’s made.</p><p><strong>Klein:</strong> And look, Bernie Sanders has been saying we’re in an oligarchy for a long time. The idea that the rich have too much power in American politics has been true for a long time. But everything is a matter of degrees. You break norms enough, and you end up in something that becomes a difference in kind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><p>Something separates the way Russia and its oligarchs work from the way America and its rich work. And I don’t think it’s just hypocrisy in America. I think that the deal between Putin and the oligarchs is different. And the amount of money that can be made out of that deal and the amount of power transferred in that deal is different.</p><p>There was a telling report in Bloomberg that ByteDance would maybe be open to selling TikTok to Elon Musk. That was very revealing because what better way to curry favor with this administration — both with Donald Trump himself and Musk, the other most powerful person right now. By the way, Musk himself has huge amounts of commercial interest in China around Tesla and other things.</p><p>So this is how these systems work. And I just don’t think what was going on between Joe Biden and Jeffrey Katzenberg looked like this.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>No, it definitely didn’t.</p><p>Speaking of ominous, let’s talk about the pardons — a sweeping 1,500 people. I mean, that’s a rough number. Lots of people just had their cases swept out. That’s extraordinary. We have to stop for a second and just think about that.</p><p>A bunch of people who tried to change the electoral procedures of the United States, make Jan. 6 into a thing when it had been more purely ceremonial before that — under the threat of violence — all those people have been pardoned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><p>It’s sort of obvious the message being sent there. But I want to talk about that. He’s got a little army there. What’s up?</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>I keep saying that we have entered a new regime. Not just a new set of people in power but a different way power is wielded, a different way American politics works. And this is one of the places you see it.</p><p>Maybe in some other system, in some other world, you’d want to say: Every election is stolen, and my people should go out into the streets with their guns and try to take it back. But you don’t, because you understand this is an infinite game. You’re trying to keep playing the game of American democracy. And if one side defects from that game, then it’s very hard for the whole system to sustain itself.</p><p>That is not the way Donald Trump has ever viewed it. When he loses elections, he says his elections are rigged — going back, by the way, to the Iowa caucuses against Ted Cruz in 2016, which Trump lost and said were rigged.</p><p>The way Donald Trump sees it: He is the leader of an army. I think this is functionally accurate — that he incited his followers to try to take back power by force. They tried, and they failed. And that was a battle lost — not a horrible day in which things got out of control. And when you lose a battle and your brave soldiers become prisoners of war, hostages to the other side, if you then win the war, you free them. And not just free them — you honor them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><p>That is the shift in perception here. There was a lot of talk that he wouldn’t perhaps pardon those who had been convicted for acts of violence, but he pardoned them, too —</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>People who hurt other human beings —</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>And hurt police officers. So much for his support for the police —</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>Doesn’t extend to the Capitol Police —</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>These are the new rules.</p><p>I will say I am caught between a lot of frustration and anger at Joe Biden and a certain amount of understanding by Biden’s sort of shifting back and forth on how he wants to view this new world.</p><p>Because if you do believe that the justice system will be completely politicized, that there’s no norm that Trump and those around him will not break, then I somewhat understand why you want to pardon your family and a number of the people you think might be in the cross hairs.</p><p>I was particularly sympathetic — as I say at the top of this show — to Hunter Biden. An unusual amount of right-wing vengeance was going to be focused on him. In some conceptual way, I wish that pardon hadn’t happened. But speaking as a human being and as a father, I can understand where Biden’s head was.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p>But then to pardon first so many other people — just, like, pardons everywhere. And you’re just hearing about pardons for weeks. And then to pardon so many members of your family and Anthony Fauci and Liz Cheney — it’s in a way an acceptance of the new regime.</p><p>It’s saying: We play by these rules, too, now. We pardon our people, they pardon their people. The pardon power is about making sure nobody can hurt your people.</p><p>And I understand how, in Biden’s head, in his administration’s head, what they feel like they’re doing is protecting their people from these new rules. But in another way, they were creating a kind of acceptance of them.</p><p>And I’m not saying that would change what Trump did. But in terms of the ability for Democrats to stand against it and fight it, I think it was harmful. And many top Democrats I’ve spoken to have said the same thing in private, if not in public.</p><p>This is all, to me, frightening — in terms of Trump’s pardons, in terms of how he lined up who is in the room. He is revealing the new rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><div><p>Not the new policies. The new policies are less different than what he promised during the campaign, less in the way of tariffs, less in the way of talking about taxes. It’s the new rules that are more different, the new power structure that is more different.</p><p>To me, that was the message of the first day. And to me, that in a way, to go back to your first question, is what we’re seeing “Make America Great Again” really means: To make America great again, the Make America Great Again movement needs total power to remake this country and destroy those who oppose it. There is no commitment to the system. There’s no commitment to elections. There’s no commitment to something beyond what keeps MAGA in power. And Donald Trump was just delivering justice to those who had fought for him in a war, in a battle that lost. But now he is coming back as the hero who has won the war. And he is not going to forget those who fought for him. And he is not going to forget those who fought against him.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>The first time around, Trump was the “I alone can fix it” guy. During his Inaugural Address, he actually said he had been put here by God, to make America great again.</p><p>So what do you make of the Trump theory of the divine right of presidents or specifically the divine right of President Trump?</p><p><strong>Klein: </strong>By every account, including his own, Donald Trump experienced his near assassination as a divine touch. He was saved. And he must have been saved for a purpose. And there are many people around him, including faith leaders, who have told him he was saved for a purpose.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><p>I did an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/opinion/donald-trump-ezra-klein-podcast.html" title="">audio essay</a> before the election where I talked about the fundamental nature of Donald Trump, the fundamental feature of his psychology being this disinhibition. Behind his success is his willingness to do and say and act in ways that other people would not. And also behind what makes him dangerous is his willingness to do things and say things and act in ways other people would not. That ranges from launching a memecoin under your own name the weekend of your inauguration all the way to possibly going to war for Greenland.</p><p>That was his psychology before. Now you add to that this feeling of being chosen, of having persevered beyond all odds, of having been persecuted. They tried to put him in jail. They tried to kill him. This is how he understands it. And he was protected, and he fought. And now, not only did he win, but he has won with a cultural momentum and acceptance. A level of support and friendship from the most powerful people in society — people who rejected him and laughed at him and looked down on him in 2017 — that he never could have imagined.</p><p>The hero’s arc to live through that — what would that do to even a person who began as humble? What would that do to even a person who had the normal restraints on their behavior? What must it do to the kind of temperament that Donald Trump is? What will it do to his perception of risk? Will his advisers say that launching these missiles, that sending this force, that abandoning this alliance is a bad idea — but is God not with him?</p><p>I will never be one to say that I have some full understanding of Donald Trump’s psychology. But the particular context in which he takes office for the second time strikes me as very accelerationist for the kind of psychology we have seen him to have. To add to that a sense of historical destiny is, on the one hand, quite unnerving, and also speaks, I think, to the great weakness and what might prove to be, if I had to guess, the fatal vulnerability of the Trump administration and his second term.</p><p>In many ways, Donald Trump was saved in his first term by all the people who did not allow him to do things that he otherwise wanted to do — like shoot missiles into Mexico or unleash the National Guard to begin shooting on protesters en masse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p>Now he is unleashed. And not just to make policy or make foreign policy decisions but to enrich himself.</p><p>And understanding a popular-vote victory of a point and a half — where you end up with the smallest House majority since the Great Depression, where you lose half of the Senate races in battleground states, and where not a single governor’s mansion changes hands — as a kind of victory that is blessed by God for unsparing ambition and greatness: That’s the kind of mismatch between public mood and presidential energy that — I guess it could create greatness. It seems also like it can create catastrophe. So we’ll see.</p><p>Aaron, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Retica: </strong>Thank you very much.</p><p><em>You can listen to this conversation by following “The Ezra Klein Show” on </em><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyt-audio/id1549293936" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>NYT Audio App</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1548604447" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Apple</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3oB5noYIwEB2dMAREj2F7S" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/c4a3b1da-5433-49e6-8c14-0e1da53be78c/the-ezra-klein-show" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Amazon Music</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdMrbgYfVl-szepgVpArP0obwYgbKdfvx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/326-the-ezra-klein-show-31142409/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>iHeartRadio</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/opinion/how-to-listen-ezra-klein-show-nyt.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em>wherever you get your podcasts</em></a><em>.
