    <h1>L.A. Times Owner Plans ‘Bias Meter’ Next to Coverage</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On news and opinion articles, “you have a bias meter so somebody could understand, as a reader, that the source of the article has some level of bias,” he explained in the interview. “And what we need to do is not have what we call confirmation bias, and then that story automatically — the reader can press a button and get both sides of that exact same story based on that story, and then give comments.”</p><p>He said he planned to introduce the tool in January.</p><p>Dr. Soon-Shiong’s latest comments set off immediate pushback from the L.A. Times Guild, which represents journalists at the paper.</p><p>“Recently, the newspaper’s owner has publicly suggested his staff harbors bias, without offering evidence or examples,” the union’s leadership said in a <a href="https://latguild.com/news/2024/12/5/lat-guild-statement-our-commitment-to-journalistic-integrity" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Thursday. The union said all Times staff members abided by ethics guidelines that call for “fairness, precision, transparency, vigilance against bias, and an earnest search to understand all sides of an issue.”</p><p>Harry Litman, a senior legal affairs columnist for The Los Angeles Times’s Opinion section, announced Thursday that he was resigning from the paper because of recent actions by Dr. Soon-Shiong. “I don’t want to continue to work for a paper that is appeasing Trump and facilitating his assault on democratic rule for craven reasons,” he <a href="https://harrylitman.substack.com/p/why-i-just-resigned-from-the-los?r=14rrh9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> of his resignation in a post on Substack.</p><p>“My resignation is a protest and visceral reaction against the conduct of the paper’s owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong,” he said. “Soon-Shiong has made several moves to force the paper, over the forceful objections of his staff, into a posture more sympathetic to Donald Trump.”</p></div></div>
