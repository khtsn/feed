Those include boldface rock ’n’ roll names from the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s (Cocker, Idol), punk and alternative heroes (Joy Division, Soundgarden, the White Stripes), arena-filling giants (Oasis, Phish), a hip-hop act (Outkast) and a nod to the world outside mainstream Anglo-American pop (Maná).</p><p>Given <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/arts/music/jann-wenner-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame.html" title="">the intense pressure the Rock Hall has faced</a> in recent years to correct its poor record of admitting women to the pantheon, the inclusion of just two female performers — Carey and Lauper, neither of them new to the ballot — may bring yet more scrutiny to the institution <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/arts/music/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-john-sykes.html" title="">despite its promises to reform</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For longtime Rock Hall watchers, the biggest news this year may be Checker. His song “The Twist” — a cover of a B-side originally released by Hank Ballard and the Midnighters — was a global phenomenon in the early 1960s, and it stands as <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-hot-100-singles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the biggest hits</a> in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. But until now, Checker, 83, has been ignored by the Rock Hall, despite years — decades, even — of complaints from his fans and protests by Checker himself. (Ballard, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/04/arts/hank-ballard-whose-twist-set-off-a-60-s-dance-craze.html" title="">died in 2003</a>, was inducted into the hall in 1990.)</p><p>In 2001, Checker took out a full-page ad in Billboard magazine calling on the Rock Hall — along with nominators of the Nobel Prizes — to recognize him for the song that, he said, became “the biggest dance of the century.”</p><p>“I want my flowers while I’m alive,” <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1574700.stm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote</a>. “I can’t smell them when I’m dead.”</p><p>In 2018, the Rock Hall included “The Twist” in a new honor, a list of <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2018/04/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_int.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">singles that shaped rock ’n’ roll</a>.</p><p>Artists become eligible for nomination 25 years after the release of their first recording. The nominations are voted on by more than 1,000 music historians, industry professionals and inducted artists.</p><p>The winning nominees are to be announced in April, and this year’s induction ceremony will be held in Los Angeles in the fall.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-sisario">More about Ben Sisario</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
