    <h1>Trump Picks Sean Duffy, Fox Business Host, for Transportation Secretary</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Transportation policy has a long bipartisan history,” said Representative Rick Larsen of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, “and I look forward to continuing to maintain the tradition under former Representative Sean Duffy’s leadership and working together to pass the next surface transportation authorization, creating more jobs, if he is confirmed.”</p><p>Airlines for America, which represents the country’s largest airlines, praised Mr. Duffy’s nomination. In a statement, Nicholas E. Calio, the president and chief executive of the trade group, said, “Congressman Duffy has a proven track record for getting things done, and we are eager to collaborate with him on key issues impacting the U.S. airline industry.”</p><p>A Wisconsin native, Mr. Duffy began his political career as a district attorney for Ashland County, in the northern part of the state. He resigned after winning his congressional election. During his time in Congress, Mr. Duffy served on the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p>Mr. Trump credited Mr. Duffy with clearing “extensive Legislative hurdles to build the largest road and bridge project in Minnesota History.” Mr. Duffy was a co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation, led by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, to support the St. Croix River bridge project, which connects Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p><p>As a Fox News contributor, Mr. Duffy was critical of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. On the “Tucker Carlson Tonight” program in December 2022, Mr. Duffy said the holiday airline travel chaos at the time had been foreseeable, adding: “What’s striking is how often this happens. There’s a crisis, and Pete Buttigieg decides to ignore it.”</p><p>Before his stint at Fox, Mr. Duffy joined CNN in 2019 as a political commentator. He provoked pushback from his on-air colleagues by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/29/cnn-sean-duffy-anti-immigrant-bigotry-061434" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">embracing Mr. Trump’s position on immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/sean-duffy-spends-first-day-at-cnn-pushing-pro-trump-conspiracy-theory-debunked-by-network/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promoting a debunked conspiracy theory</a> about the special counsel investigation of Russian election interference.</p></div></div>
