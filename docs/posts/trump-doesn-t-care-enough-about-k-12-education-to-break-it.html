What I want is for my children to have a strong foundation in the core subjects: reading, math, science and history. I want my kids to be challenged to the best of their abilities and be prepared for the future. I want to be guaranteed that they will be physically safe. I don’t want monthslong school board fights over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/09/opinion/book-banning-parents.html" title="">book bans</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/us/san-francisco-schools-lincoln-feinstein.html" title="">school renaming</a>. I just want my children <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to read books</a> and go to school.</p><p>People disagree about how best to meet these goals. (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/democrats-and-republicans-on-k-12-education-a-comparison/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roughly</a>, liberals think the worst public schools should be made better, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23689496/school-choice-education-savings-accounts-american-federation-children" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conservatives think parents</a> should be given more choices outside the public system, though there are some heterodox advocates.) But the depressing fact is that neither party has delivered on the basics. As I argued last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/opinion/covid-education-crisis-election.html" title="">neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris had a plan</a> for increasing test scores, fixing Covid learning loss, working on the student absentee crisis or addressing the fact that the teacher pipeline is drying up.</p><p>Though education is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a top-five issue</a> for voters, I don’t think Democrats on the city and state levels have done a good job as leaders on K-12 schools under President Biden. On the federal level, he also has struggled. For example, there’s the ongoing FAFSA debacle: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/us/politics/fafsa-delayed-for-second-year.html" title="">The federal student aid application form</a> was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/10/01/new-fafsa-form/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delayed for a second year</a> after last year’s disastrous rollout of a new form.</p><p>A lot of students are still suffering from the prolonged school closings of 2020 and ’21, and schools in blue cities and suburbs were closed the longest. While the Biden-Harris administration isn’t responsible for these decisions made on the local level, I don’t think <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-school-closings-covid-teachers-union-eliot-hine-middle-school-8e29f10e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it did enough to push back</a> on the districts that were completely closed for in-person learning after adults could be vaccinated. The federal government pumped a lot of money into Covid education relief, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/schools-pandemic-aid-runs-out-00175065" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that funding expired in September</a>. As a public school parent, I can feel it: My third grader’s class has 30 kids in it, more than we had ever experienced since my older child entered the system in 2017.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Trump’s first term, he proposed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-proposes-71-billion-funding-decrease-education/story?id=61609098" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">billions of dollars of cuts to the Department of Education</a> that did not get through Congress. His secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, was a huge proponent of school choice. “But for all her efforts, DeVos has little to show for it,” NPR’s Cory Turner said in 2020.</p><p>Despite Trump’s lackluster record, his ability to gain voters in urban areas might have had to do with how much voters were fed up with Democratic leadership on things like education. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/08/donald-trump-win-electoral-map-00187135" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was able to win in part because</a>, as Politico’s Charlie Mahtesian explained, “in big, diverse urban places — like Houston’s Harris County or Chicago’s Cook County — he pared down traditionally large Democratic margins.” Trump also increased support in blue places like <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/trump-voter-gains-new-york-00188078" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York</a>, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/election/article/trump-election-sf-california-19894648.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">San Francisco</a> and the densely populated <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/06/virginia-election-youngkin-trump-harris/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.</a> And a lot of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/voter-turnout-election-2024-927a102c?st=S2u4oz&amp;reflink=article_email_share" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">city-dwelling Democrats stayed home</a>.</p><p>Chicago, the third-largest school district in the country, is a prime example of how chaotic Democratic leadership has been on education in the past four years. The mayor, Brandon Johnson, is a former teacher whose 2023 campaign received <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/johnson-campaign-up-to-5-6m-from-teachers-unions-after-another-big-donation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of dollars from teachers’ unions</a>.</p><p>This year Johnson <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-mayor-defensive-mass-school-board-resignation/story?id=114633436" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed taking out a $300 million high-interest short-term loan</a> to fund teachers’ contracts, despite the fact that the city faces a <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/08/29/chicago-faces-nearly-1b-budget-gap-in-2025-there-are-sacrifices-that-will-be-made/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1 billion funding shortfall</a> in 2025. The district <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/chicago-public-schools-staff-up-20-enrollment-down-10-5/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost nearly 40,000 students between 2019 and 2024</a>, but staffing is up 20 percent, and it is fiscally irresponsible to put the city deeper into debt without facing the reality of declining enrollment head-on.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/chicago-education-board-resignations.html" title="">entire Board of Education resigned</a> in opposition to this proposal. Just before the election, Johnson appointed a new school board president, who had to resign within a week after it was revealed that he had posted <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/us/chicago-school-board-president-resigns/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sept. 11 conspiracy theories on social media.</a> According <a href="https://x.com/MaryAnnAhernNBC/status/1851387233023995941" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to a late October poll</a> from <a href="https://changeresearch.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Change Research</a>, a left-leaning polling firm, only 14 percent of Chicagoans had a favorable rating of Johnson. Though he was the most unpopular person or group polled in the Change poll, the Chicago Teachers Union, Chicago Public Schools and the school board also had negative favorability ratings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>If Trump actually cared about K-12 education, he would make a bold move right now to help public schools. Though only a small portion of public school funding comes from the federal government, the problems we face are so large that they are crying out for a federal response that includes continued <a href="https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/high-dosage-tutoring-can-help-remediate-learning-loss-funding-running-out" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">funding for things like high-dosage tutoring</a> to ameliorate Covid learning loss.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trump’s first term offers scant evidence that he has the desire to do much more than wage painful culture-war battles. He has <a href="https://x.com/CollinRugg/status/1856028383622087086" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released plans to attack the college accreditation system</a>, which would involve firing “the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics.”</p><p>I spent last week talking to education experts from across the political spectrum. And while I hate prognosticating, especially with someone as unpredictable as Trump is, the consensus was that whatever he does with colleges, he is unlikely to accomplish some of what he has threatened to do with K-12 education.</p><p>They did not think he would <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/can-trump-really-dismantle-the-department-of-education/2024/11" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abolish the Department of Education</a> (which Republican presidential candidates <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-republicans-keep-talking-about-abolishing-the-education-department-why/2023/10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have threatened to do since 1980</a>). “Even with a united Republican Congress, it will be hard for him to get his party to go along with these policies,” said Michael Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, referring to dismantling the department and cutting education spending. These ideas are “deeply <a href="https://umass-my.sharepoint.com/personal/crystalpaul_umass_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?ga=1&amp;id=%2Fpersonal%2Fcrystalpaul%5Fumass%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FUMass%20Poll%20Polls%20for%20Web%20Posting%2FTrump%2C%20GOP%2C%20Project%202025%2C%20Violence%202024%20National%20Poll%20%2D%20August%208%2C%202024%2FToplines%20Trump%20GOP%20Project%202025%20Violence%202024%20National%20Poll%20%2D%20August%208%2C%202024%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fcrystalpaul%5Fumass%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FUMass%20Poll%20Polls%20for%20Web%20Posting%2FTrump%2C%20GOP%2C%20Project%202025%2C%20Violence%202024%20National%20Poll%20%2D%20August%208%2C%202024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unpopular</a>,” he added.</p><p>What Trump will certainly do is pick splashy fights that he can win through executive orders. For example, he will almost certainly reverse the transgender student protections put in place by <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4656405-donald-trump-transgender-students-athletes-title-ix-lgbtq/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order from Biden</a> this year. Mr. Trump may also try to use <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-president-trumps-ten-principles-for-great-schools-leading-to-great-jobs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive orders</a> to “cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children,” as he vowed to do. Though it’s pretty unclear how that would play out in practice, it’s certainly chilling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Two things give me a sliver of optimism. One is the hope that parents and other citizens with students’ best interests in mind can look beyond the polarizing presence of Trump this time around and try to organize on the state and local levels to fix the huge problems we have right now. Education reform doesn’t have to be political, and so much is decided outside the federal government.</p><p>The second comes from Tim Daly, the chief executive of <a href="https://www.ednavigator.org/our-team/tim-daly" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EdNavigator</a> and the author of a <a href="https://www.educationdaly.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">newsletter on education</a>. He said: “It’s just as important to focus on what Trump won’t do as what he will. He isn’t going to make it illegal to run a good school. Teaching and learning can proceed. The bonds that families feel to their local schools aren’t that affected by partisan politics.” I really hope that he’s right.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Thank you for being a subscriber</strong></p><p>Read past editions of the newsletter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/jessica-grose-on-parenting-newsletter" title="">here</a>.</p><p>If you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others.
