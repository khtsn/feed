Some people come to listen, some to vent, some to mull the parables through fogs of addiction or mental illness. They seek hope, but even when hope proves elusive the gatherings can provide a sense of community absent on the street.</p><p>In Bible study, no one is treated as an outcast or even a client. Everyone is a child of God.</p><p>“There’s no ‘us’ and ‘them’ around that table — just ‘us,’” said Tara Ruszkowski, the center’s director. “There’s such a richness to the faith lives of our guests. To have faith when so much is working against you is to have strong faith.”</p><p>Celebrating the faith of the poor makes some advocates for the needy uneasy. Proselytizers have used aid to coerce professions of belief. Rulers have promised heavenly rewards to quiet demand for earthly justice. Some calls for religion are covert attacks on government aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kate Brady, right, during Bible study with Mr. O’Connor, a longtime volunteer leader of the Bible study sessions.

Whatever benefits it lends the dispossessed, it also offers a reminder that people lumped together as “the homeless” are not an undifferentiated mass but individuals with inner lives and needs that go beyond survival to the search for meaning.</p><p>“When I tell people that I study the religious lives of unhoused people, they’re usually surprised to hear that unhoused people have religious lives,” said Susan Dunlap, a Presbyterian minister who taught at Duke Divinity School and volunteered as a shelter chaplain. “It humanizes unhoused people to think they’re theologically interpreting the world.”</p><p>Few of the Lamb Center’s clients have undergone a faith journey with as much energy and purpose as Ms. Brady, 67, who filled her journals with hymns, scripture, prayers, and professions of belief before the center helped her find housing.</p><p>Her suffering might have shaken another person’s faith, but Ms. Brady said hers grew and helped her persevere. “I didn’t understand why God allows bad things to happen,” she said. “But I could feel his hand taking care of me. That was just a lifeline to my soul.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-30947186">Gathering for Support</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cindy Murphy, right, a volunteer at The Lamb Center, helps serve lunch.

It offers free breakfast and lunch, dental care, showers, a wash-and-fold laundry, a subsidized jobs program and case managers with master’s degrees to help clients find housing and health care. Its 54-unit building for the chronically homeless, scheduled to break ground next year, will be the largest in Fairfax County. None of those services impose religion.</p><p>But the center treats Bible study as equally vital, if not more so. The sessions gather some of the poorest people in one of the country’s richest counties. But few of them express class anger or ask why God permits their suffering.</p><p>They are more likely to say they feel God’s immediate presence. After a hard rain, Rommel Cariño praised God for a dry tent: “The water, instead of flooding, flowed around! Even now, he’s here!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Tim O’Connor, a longtime volunteer leader of the Bible study sessions, said hardship makes clients feel a special need for God. “Their faith is raw — it’s part of their survival,” he said.</p><p>Mindful of the shame many unhoused people feel, Mr. O’Connor emphasizes a relatable Jesus who suffered his own setbacks. A favorite lesson involves Jesus returning to Nazareth, where he was chased from his hometown. “I use that to tell people to keep going, stay strong,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“There’s no ‘us’ and ‘them’ around that table — just ‘us,’” Tara Ruszkowski, the center’s director, said of the Bible study sessions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Moriah Ratner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The idea that faith can aid the afflicted finds support in a growing medical literature, summarized in an 1,100-page volume called the “Handbook of Religion and Health.” </p><p>“Religious practices and beliefs can be very powerful in helping people cope with mental illness and addiction,” said Dr. Harold Koenig, a Duke University psychiatrist and the work’s lead author.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Faith does not help everyone, he noted, and it is less a cure than a source of strength. Still, it works on multiple levels: it offers meaning and purpose, role models from scriptures and often a community. Moreover, no one needs a prescription. “It’s accessible to people in all circumstances,” Dr. Koenig said.</p><p>Few studies have focused on homelessness and faith, but <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21969651/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one followed nearly 600 chronically homeless adults</a> entering the services system. A year later, only about a quarter reported increased religiosity. But that group claimed better mental health, less substance abuse, and a higher quality of life.</p><p>The study could not separate cause and effect — whether faith promoted recovery or recovery promoted faith. Still “a lot of people experiencing homelessness draw on religion as a source of strength,” said Jack Tsai, a psychologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, who coauthored the study.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The center’s Bible study is voluntary and open to those of all faiths. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Moriah Ratner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The Lamb Center’s Bible studies reflect Christian teachings, but all are welcome and the sessions have drawn Muslims, Buddhists and atheists. A Muslim women’s group has sent kitchen volunteers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“We’re not trying to convert anyone,” said Dave Larrabee, the pastoral director. “If anything, we’re happy to strengthen them in their faith.”</p><p>Part of the appeal is purely social. The gatherings give people accustomed to vigilance a chance to model a gentler self. “I love you,” Mr. Larrabee tells his guests, and some tell him the same.</p><p>Perhaps the welcoming atmosphere explains why the sessions often attract people with obvious mental illness, whom Mr. Larrabee calls “modern-day lepers” for the scorn they endure. “Even if you’re really out there, you can feel like you’re being heard,” he said.</p><p>While the sessions can connect people with services, sometimes they just showcase pain. One day a woman named Amna said she could not stop talking to herself on the street. “I go cuss myself out,” she said, and in response, people attack her. She was wearing a hospital bracelet.</p><p>“I’ve been outside in the cold, treated like crap!”</p><p>“We love you,” another guest said.</p><p>“You look at me on the bus like I don’t even exist!” Amna erupted, raging at an audience in her head. “My ankle is broken. I’ve gotten punched in the face!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Her anguish silenced the room and she left.</p><h2 id="link-2b0d29e4">‘I Needed to Believe’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kate Brady became homeless at age 53 after a series of setbacks.

She grew up middle class but abused, she said, beaten by a father who said he did not love her. She married and divorced, raised three children and enrolled in community college after her father offered to pay her bills, perhaps hoping to make amends. Then he died.</p><p>Even Ms. Brady struggles to explain how quickly she lost everything, from her apartment to her bearings. Perhaps the death, ending all chance of reconciliation, resurfaced the childhood trauma. “I had panic attacks, depression — just constant crying,” she said.</p><p>She lived in her car until it was repossessed, then moved into the woods. Her ID was stolen, making it hard to get aid. “I just had a psychotic break,” she said.</p><p>It is especially dangerous to be unhoused as a woman. She found a room in a Maryland boardinghouse in exchange for cleaning, but another resident broke her nose and left her in a wheelchair for months. She said she still grapples with the trauma of being raped in the Virginia woods.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>But “strange as it sounds, my faith grew,” Ms. Brady said. “I needed to believe.”</p><p>She memorized scripture. She sang hymns in her tent. She found churches that welcomed the homeless. (Not all did.)

Her family was looking for her. In subsequent calls, she agreed to accept help if they found a Christian social services group. An internet search led to the Lamb Center, and her sons brought her.</p><p>A routine set in, with nights at church shelters, days at the center, and Bible study as a morning anchor. Mostly, the center provided secular services. A caseworker helped her enroll in food stamps, Medicaid, and mental health services, replace her ID, and join the waiting list for supportive housing.</p><p>But when Ms. Brady asked, the caseworker prayed with her, too, which helped her trust him. “I was treated like a whole person — my body, soul and spirit,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-36"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tina Wickham, right, and Damian Villanueva, volunteers, fold laundry for guests at the Lamb Center. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Moriah Ratner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><p>Sicker than she knew, Ms. Brady was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and Lyme disease.
