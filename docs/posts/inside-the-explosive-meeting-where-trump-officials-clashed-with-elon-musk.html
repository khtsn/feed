While the statement did not indicate what grants would be terminated, it said that the Health and Human Services and Education Departments would assist in issuing stop-work orders to immediately freeze the university’s access to some funds.</p><p>The statement said that the cancellations represented the “first round of action” and that additional cancellations were expected to follow. Columbia currently holds more than $5 billion in federal grant commitments, the statement said.</p><p>The school also faces three federal investigations into allegations of antisemitism on campus that have been announced over the past several weeks.</p><p>“Universities must comply with all federal anti-discrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding” Ms. McMahon said. “For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.”</p><p>A Columbia spokeswoman said the university was reviewing the announcement and that it pledged to work with the federal government to restore the funding.</p><p>“We take Columbia’s legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combating antisemitism and ensuring the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff,” the spokeswoman said.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="30" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMWIzOTdkMzQtOGVkOC01OTIwLThkMWUtZjU4MDdlMmMxMTEw"><div id="1b397d34-8ed8-5920-8d1e-f5807e2c1110" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/07/us/trump-news-crypto#1b397d34-8ed8-5920-8d1e-f5807e2c1110"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague"><img alt="Zach Montague" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-07T19:03:32.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 7, 2025, 2:03 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336.53.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filing</a> on Friday, a coalition of foreign aid organizations in the middle of a lawsuit against U.S.A.I.D. and the State Department reported that they had approximately $670 million in invoices and unfulfilled funding requests that those agencies will be required to pay by Monday.

It had filed the lawsuit after regulators determined that the plant’s emissions of chloroprene, a likely carcinogen, were contributing to health concerns in an area with the <a href="https://www.lsuhsc.edu/newsroom/LSUHealthNO%20LA%20Tumor%20Registry%20Reports%201st%20Census%20Tract%20Cancer%20Incidence.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highest cancer risk</a> of any place in the United States, and demanded the facility reduce its pollution levels.</p><p>The Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment about why it was dropping the case. Environmental advocates called the decision shameful.</p><p>“The American people did not vote to let corporate polluters get away with violating the law and making the air unsafe to breathe,” said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog group. She said that plans to dismiss the case “should raise alarm bells for communities across the country.”</p><p>Denka, a Japanese company that acquired the plant from DuPont in 2015, issued a statement calling the Trump administration’s decision “a long-overdue and appropriate end to a case lacking scientific and legal merit from the start.”</p><p>The company said the facility’s emissions were at a historical low after Denka invested more than $35 million in pollution controls and other measures. It called the government’s scientific assessments of the cancer risk of chloroprene “exaggerated.”</p><p>Chloroprene is used to produce neoprene, a synthetic rubber that is found in automotive parts, hoses, drink cozies, orthopedic braces and electric cables. The Environmental Protection Agency identified chloroprene as a likely human carcinogen in 2010.</p><p>In 2023, the E.P.A. and the Justice Department sued Denka, arguing that the Louisiana plant posed an “imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare,” and should be compelled to reduce its emissions.</p><p>The plant is in LaPlace, La., an industrial stretch of the state between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that is known as “Cancer Alley” because of its high concentration of petrochemical plants and refineries. Air monitors at the Denka facility had revealed long-term exposure levels up to 15 times higher than the recommended limits for lifetime exposure.</p><p>In announcing the lawsuit two years ago, the E.P.A. said that it had found that children under 18 accounted for about 20 percent of the population living within two and a half miles of the Denka plant. More than 300 children who attended an elementary school located less than 500 feet from the Denka facility had been exposed to chloroprene emissions, the agency said.</p><p>“People living next door to this plant have really been let down,” said Eric Schaeffer, a former director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s civil enforcement office. The Trump administration, he said, “is not interested in enforcing environmental laws.”</p><p>The notice that the Trump administration would dismiss the case came one day after President Trump in his joint address to Congress spoke about childhood cancer rates. Mr. Trump said his administration would prioritize addressing that issue and “get toxins out of our environment.” The White House declined to comment on the Denka case.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzVkNDU0ZWFmLThjYjItNWE3My1hMmU2LTc5ZGI4MTY5ZGFlOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/07/us/trump-news-crypto#trump-south-africa-farmers-citizenship" data-source-id="100000010038553"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon"><img alt="John Eligon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-07T17:49:54.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 7, 2025, 12:49 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of President Trump outside the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joao Silva/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The United States will immediately start offering a rapid pathway to citizenship for South African farmers, President Trump said in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114121529754059509" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a> on Friday, falsely claiming that South Africa’s government was confiscating their land “and MUCH WORSE THAN THAT.”</p><p>The post largely echoed what Mr. Trump has previously said about South Africa, including in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-south-africa-aid-white-landowners.html" title="">an executive order</a> last month in which he suspended all American aid to the country and offered refugee status to Afrikaners, a white ethnic minority.</p><div><p>In January, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa signed into law a measure that would allow the government to take land in the public interest without providing compensation; shortly after, Mr. Trump began criticizing the South African government. Elon Musk, who is from South Africa, has backed the president’s statements with his own social media posts that accuse the country’s government of having openly racist laws.</p><p>“A bad place to be right now,” Mr. Trump wrote of South Africa on Friday.</p><p>His post comes as the South African government is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/africa/south-africa-trump-trade.html" title="">preparing a trade deal</a> to offer to Mr. Trump, hoping that it will settle tensions, stave off further punitive action and convince him to keep a close relationship with South Africa. Mr. Ramaphosa had previously said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/south-africa-ramaphosa-trump-land-us-aid.html" title="">Mr. Trump was spreading misinformation</a> and that he was looking forward to meeting with the U.S. president to clear the air.</p><p>“We are not going to partake in counterproductive megaphone diplomacy,” Vincent Magwenya, a spokesman for Mr. Ramaphosa, said in response to Friday’s post. “We remain committed to building a mutually beneficial bilateral trade, political and diplomatic relationship with the United States. Obviously, it must be a relationship that is based on mutual respect and respect for our independence and sovereignty.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s post on Friday departed from his executive order in one crucial way. The order specifically offered refuge to Afrikaners, the descendants of European colonizers who led the apartheid regime. But his post said that farmers could flee to the United States. While most of the major commercial farmers in South Africa are white, most farmers overall are Black, and many of them produce food to feed themselves and their families.</p><p>It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will extend refugee status and rapid citizenship to Black farmers. Since returning to office in January, Mr. Trump has made it a priority to crack down on the influx of refugees into the United States.</p><p>Some conservative Afrikaners have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/africa/afrikaners-trump-south-africa.html" title="">tried to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s support</a>. A delegation of them met with White House officials in Washington last week, asking for U.S. funding to help build their own communities. They also asked for the United States to put pressure on the South African government to repeal laws meant to address the inequalities created under apartheid that they believe discriminate against white people.</p><p>Many Afrikaner activists have said that they would rather live in an improved South Africa than flee to the United States.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvY2YyYTg0ZWItZmNmMC01MjgxLWIxNjUtMzYyOTBiNWM1MzE0"><div id="cf2a84eb-fcf0-5281-b165-36290b5c5314" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/07/us/trump-news-crypto#cf2a84eb-fcf0-5281-b165-36290b5c5314"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erica-l-green"><img alt="Erica L.

Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said Russian forces launched a “massive missile and drone” assault on power and gas facilities across the country.</p><p>“Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely “pounding” Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,” Mr. Trump wrote. “To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.”</p><p>New sanctions would be the latest turnabout for Mr. Trump’s management of the war in Ukraine. He has spent weeks aligning himself with President Vladimir Putin’s narrative of the war, criticizing Ukraine for being invaded by Russia, and he recently halted U.S. aid to Kyiv and intelligence sharing after a tense Oval Office meeting last week with President Volodymyr Zelensky last month.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky have spent recent days smoothing over relations following the eruption, which resulted in Mr. Zelensky’s leaving the White House without signing a deal that would grant the United States a share of its revenues from mining rare earth metals.</p><p>Mr. Trump has insisted on the minerals deal, which he considers reimbursement for the more than $100 billion in military aid the U.S. has provided to the country to stave off Russia — is critical to the U.S.’s continued investment in bringing peace in the region. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky have both indicated they were still interested in signing the deal.</p><p>But Mr. Trump has spoken sparingly about Russia’s role in the war, and what it ultimately wants to broker a peace deal. Russian officials met last month with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-diplomacy.html" title="">top Trump officials in Saudi Arabia</a> as Russia has signaled an openness to talks, though it has not said if it would accept a cease-fire or an agreement to end the war.</p><p>Moscow has given no public indication it would accept any truce, cease-fire or end to the war it launched three years ago. U.S. officials have said Russia had shown openness to continuing discussions.</p><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ukraine-zelensky-trump-russia.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">speaking from the Oval Office</a>, Mr. Trump said that U.S. negotiators had “made a lot of progress with Ukraine and a lot of progress with Russia over the last couple of days,” but was elusive on details.</p><p>“I think what’s going to happen is Ukraine wants to make a deal because I don’t think they have a choice,” Mr. Trump said. “I also think that Russia wants to make a deal because in a certain different way — a different way that only I know, only I know — they have no choice.”</p><p>In his post on Friday, Trump urged both leaders to “get to the table right now, before it is too late.”</p><p>The Biden administration imposed numerous sanctions on Moscow, seeking to cripple the Russian economy and choke off its funding for its invasion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/us/politics/us-russia-sanctions.html" title="">most recently targeting Russia’s energy sector</a> and its “shadow fleet” of oil tankers.</p><p>U.S. and Ukrainian officials confirmed Thursday that Ukraine would send a delegation to meet with “military representatives of countries that are ready to make greater efforts to reliably guarantee security within the framework of ending this war.” He said the meeting was scheduled for Tuesday, but did not specify who would attend.</p><p>At next week’s meeting, Mr. Zelensky said the Ukrainians would insist on a number of commitments from Russia to test whether a lasting peace could ultimately be reached. Those demands include Russian pledges not to attack Ukraine’s energy or other civilian infrastructure; a truce for missiles, bombs and long-range drones; and no military operations in the Black Sea.</p><p>“Ukrainians truly want peace, but not at the cost of giving up Ukraine,” Mr. Zelensky said. “The real question for any negotiations is whether Russia is capable of giving up the war.”</p><p>Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Tbilisi, Georgia, and Nataliya Vasilyeva from Istanbul.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZWIwNDMyNjYtNWVjNy01ZDgzLWIzM2YtODE5NTRjNzk4NTBh"><div id="eb043266-5ec7-5d83-b33f-81954c79850a" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/07/us/trump-news-crypto#eb043266-5ec7-5d83-b33f-81954c79850a"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-mccreesh"><img alt="Shawn McCreesh" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-07T17:31:22.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 7, 2025, 12:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Trump says he is not considering pardoning Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of killing George Floyd.

Here he was in the Cabinet Room of the White House, the secretary of state, seated beside the president and listening to a litany of attacks from the richest man in the world.</p><p>Seated diagonally opposite, across the elliptical mahogany table, Elon Musk was letting Mr. Rubio have it, accusing him of failing to slash his staff.</p><div><p>You have fired “nobody,” Mr. Musk told Mr. Rubio, then scornfully added that perhaps the only person he had fired was a staff member from Mr. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>Mr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubio’s control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting in front of President Trump and around 20 others — details of which have not been reported before — Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest.</p><p>Mr. Musk was not being truthful, Mr. Rubio said. What about the more than 1,500 State Department officials who took early retirement in buyouts? Didn’t they count as layoffs? He asked, sarcastically, whether Mr. Musk wanted him to rehire all those people just so he could make a show of firing them again. Then he laid out his detailed plans for reorganizing the State Department.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Musk was unimpressed. He told Mr. Rubio he was “good on TV,” with the clear subtext being that he was not good for much else. Throughout all of this, the president sat back in his chair, arms folded, as if he were watching a tennis match.</p><p>After the argument dragged on for an uncomfortable time, Mr. Trump finally intervened to defend Mr. Rubio as doing a “great job.” Mr. Rubio has a lot to deal with, the president said. He is very busy, he is always traveling and on TV, and he has an agency to run. So everyone just needs to work together.</p><p>The meeting was a potential turning point after the frenetic first weeks of Mr. Trump’s second term. It yielded the first significant indication that Mr. Trump was willing to put some limits on Mr. Musk, whose efforts have become the subject of several lawsuits and prompted concerns from Republican lawmakers, some of whom have complained directly to the president.</p><p>Cabinet officials almost uniformly like the concept of what Mr. Musk set out to do — reducing waste, fraud and abuse in government — but have been frustrated by the chain saw approach to upending the government and the lack of consistent coordination.</p><p>Thursday’s meeting, which was abruptly scheduled on Wednesday evening, was a sign that Mr. Trump was mindful of the growing complaints. He tried to offer each side something by praising both Mr. Musk and his cabinet secretaries. (At least one, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has had tense encounters related to Mr. Musk’s team, was not present.) The president made clear he still supported the mission of the Musk initiative. But now was the time, he said, to be a bit more refined in its approach.</p><p>From now on, he said, the secretaries would be in charge; the Musk team would only advise.</p><p>It is unclear what the long-term impact of the meeting will be. Mr. Musk remains Mr. Trump’s biggest political financial supporter — just this week his super PAC aired $1 million worth of ads that said, “Thank you, President Trump” — and Mr. Musk’s control of the social media website X has made administration staff members and cabinet secretaries alike fearful that he will target them in public.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The cabinet meeting was the first significant indication that President Trump is willing to put some limits on Mr. Musk.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But if nothing else, the session laid bare the tensions within Mr. Trump’s team, and news of the sharp clashes spread quickly through senior ranks of cabinet agencies after it was over. This account is based on interviews with five people with knowledge of the events.</p><p>In a post on social media after the meeting, Mr. Trump said the next phase of his plan to cut the federal work force would be conducted with a “scalpel” rather than a “hatchet” — a clear reference to Mr. Musk’s scorched-earth approach.</p><p>Mr. Musk, who wore a suit and tie to Thursday’s meeting instead of his usual T-shirt after Mr. Trump publicly ribbed him about his sloppy appearance, defended himself by saying that he had three companies with a market cap of tens of billions of dollars, and that his results spoke for themselves.</p><p>But he was soon clashing with members of the cabinet.</p><p>Just moments before the blowup with Mr. Rubio, Mr. Musk and the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, went back and forth about the state of the Federal Aviation Administration’s equipment for tracking airplanes and what kind of fix was needed. Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, jumped in to support Mr. Musk.</p><p>Mr. Duffy said the young staff of Mr. Musk’s team was trying to lay off air traffic controllers. What am I supposed to do? Mr. Duffy said. I have multiple plane crashes to deal with now, and your people want me to fire air traffic controllers?</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A crane removing pieces of an American Airlines plane that crashed in January from the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Va.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Musk told Mr. Duffy that his assertion was a “lie.” Mr. Duffy insisted it was not; he had heard it from them directly. Mr. Musk, asking who had been fired, said: Give me their names. Tell me their names.</p><p>Mr. Duffy said there were not any names, because he had stopped them from being fired. At another point, Mr. Musk insisted that people hired under diversity, equity and inclusion programs were working in control towers. Mr. Duffy pushed back and Mr. Musk did not add details, but said during the longer back and forth that Mr. Duffy had his phone number and should call him if he had any issues to raise.</p><p>The exchange ended with Mr. Trump telling Mr. Duffy that he had to hire people from M.I.T. as air traffic controllers. These air traffic controllers need to be “geniuses,” he said.</p><p>The secretary of veterans affairs, Doug Collins, has been dealing with one of the most politically sensitive challenges of all the cabinet secretaries. Mr. Musk’s cuts will affect thousands of veterans — a powerful constituency and a core part of the Trump base. Mr. Collins made the point that they should not wield a blunt instrument and cleave off everyone from the V.A. They needed to be strategic about it. Mr. Trump agreed with Mr. Collins, saying they ought to retain the smart ones and get rid of the bad ones.</p><p>In response to a request for comment from The New York Times, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement: “As President Trump said, this was a great and productive meeting amongst members of his team to discuss cost-cutting measures and staffing across the federal government. Everyone is working as one team to help President Trump deliver on his promise to make our government more efficient.”</p><p>Tammy Bruce, a spokeswoman for the State Department, responded, “Secretary Rubio considered the meeting an open and productive discussion with a dynamic team that is united in achieving the same goal: making America great again.”</p><p>A Department of Veterans Affairs spokesman said, “As President Trump has said, it’s important to increase efficiency and reduce bureaucracy while keeping in place the best and most productive federal employees. V.A. is working with DOGE and the rest of the administration to do just that.”</p><p>In a post on X on Friday, Mr. Duffy praised Mr. Trump and the work Mr. Musk’s team is doing and said it was an effective cabinet meeting. He added that “the DEI Department at the FAA was eliminated on day 2” and that Mr. Trump’s “approach of a scalpel versus a hatchet and better coordination between Secretaries and DOGE is the right approach to revolutionizing the way our government is run.”</p><p>Mr. Musk, who later claimed on X that the cabinet meeting was “very productive,” seemed far less enthused inside the room. He aggressively defended himself, reminding the cabinet secretaries that he had built multiple billion-dollar companies from the ground up and knew something about hiring good people.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of labor groups demonstrated against Mr. Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Valerie Plesch for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Most cabinet members did not join the fray. Mr. Musk’s anger directed at Mr. Rubio in particular seemed to catch people in the room by surprise, one person with knowledge of the meeting said. Another person said Mr. Musk’s caustic responses to Mr. Duffy and Mr. Rubio seemed to deter other cabinet members, many of whom have privately complained about the Musk team, from speaking.</p><p>But it remains to be seen how long this new arrangement will last. </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMzBlNTJhNTktZGEyZi01NjY2LTllMWYtZTZjMWViODVlMmZm"><div id="30e52a59-da2f-5666-9e1f-e6c1eb85e2ff" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/07/us/trump-news-crypto#30e52a59-da2f-5666-9e1f-e6c1eb85e2ff"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-mccreesh"><img alt="Shawn McCreesh" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-shawn-mccreesh/author-shawn-mccreesh-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-07T15:31:25.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 7, 2025, 10:31 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The White House has just announced that President Trump will be speaking from the Oval Office in 30 minutes, at 11 a.m. Eastern. </p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhhZjE0ZDFiLTZmMzctNTIyNi1hMTdlLWM5NWU2YzhiMzIxNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/07/us/trump-news-crypto#education-department-mcmahon-trump" data-source-id="100000010038271"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-c-bender"><img alt="Michael C.

Asked on “Fox &amp; Friends” whether the United States “needs this department,” Ms. McMahon answered: “No, we don’t.”</p><p>In the interview, her first since she was confirmed to her cabinet post this week, Ms. McMahon said that President Trump intended to sign an executive order <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-education-department-executive-order.html" title="">aimed at closing her department</a>, but she declined to give details on timing.</p><div><p>She also did not address how the administration might persuade lawmakers to go along. The department cannot be closed without the approval of Congress.</p><p>Such a move, in a closely divided Senate, would require support from Democrats, which appears unlikely after Ms. McMahon was confirmed along party lines. During the previous session of Congress, a proposal to eliminate the department failed in the Republican-controlled House when 60 Republicans <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023156" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted against it</a>.</p><p>Asked about her message to parents and students concerned about what might happen should the department be eliminated, Ms. McMahon said, “We will see scores go up.”</p><p>Republicans have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-republicans-education-department.html" title="">pushed to close the agency</a> by arguing that student test scores have not improved despite decades of funding from the federal government.

That team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency and headed by Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, has already terminated 89 contracts worth $881 million at the agency.</p><p>“We meet with them almost daily,” Ms. McMahon said. “I’ve been very appreciative of some of the things they’ve shown us, some of the waste, and we’re reacting to that.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjRlNmRhYzAtYmQzYy01NDAwLTkzMGEtODQ0ZWNjYmFiZjNl"><div id="64e6dac0-bd3c-5400-930a-844eccbabf3e" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/07/us/trump-news-crypto#64e6dac0-bd3c-5400-930a-844eccbabf3e"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erica-l-green"><img alt="Erica L.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request to provide the letter or further describe its contents. Iran’s mission to the United Nations said on Friday that Iran had received no such letter to date.</p><div><p>In an interview that aired on Friday on Fox Business, Mr. Trump said: “There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I’m not looking to hurt Iran. They’re great people.”</p><p>The move is a sharp pivot for Mr. Trump, who in 2018 withdrew the United States from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/world/europe/iran-nuclear-deal.html" title="">nuclear deal with Iran</a>, unraveling a signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor, Barack Obama. </p><p>In the interview, with the Fox host Maria Bartiromo, Mr. Trump described his letter as saying, “I hope you’re going to negotiate because it’s going to be a lot better for Iran.”</p><p>“If we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing for them,” he said, adding: “The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can’t let them have a nuclear weapon.”</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump talked more broadly about his desire to see the world’s countries eliminate their nuclear weapons. He said he hoped to negotiate denuclearization efforts with China and Russia as well.</p><p>“It would great if everybody would get rid of their nuclear weapons,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.</p><p>In Iran, officials have vigorously debated whether to negotiate with Mr. Trump. Moderate and reformist factions, which hold the presidency, are in favor of talks, while hard-line conservatives oppose them. Iran’s economy is in shambles because of international sanctions and mismanagement, and President Masoud Pezeshkian was elected last year largely because of his pledges to improve the economy by negotiating directly with Washington.</p><p>But in Iran’s political system, Ayatollah Khamenei has the last word in all key state matters. He rejected negotiations with the United States after Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-maximum-pressure-on-iran/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed an executive order last month</a> to enforce a maximum pressure policy on Iran, and he has repeatedly said Iran that cannot trust that the United States would honor its end of any bargain.</p><p>Mr. Pezeshkian publicly distanced himself from Mr. Khamenei’s positions on the United States. On Sunday, he told the Parliament that he favored negotiations but that he had to abide by Mr. Khamenei’s ban on them. It was an unusually frank acknowledgment of the limits of the president’s power in Iran’s political system and an attempt to put the fallout of such a decision — more sanctions, worsening economy, military strikes on nuclear sites — on Mr. Khamenei.</p><p>“My position has been and will remain that I believe in negotiations, but now we have to follow the parameters set by the supreme leader,” Mr. Pezeshkian said.</p><p>Luke Broadwater<!-- --> reported from Washington and <!-- -->Farnaz Fassihi<!-- --> from New York.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOGYwNDUxOWItNjdlNC01MzViLWI5ODYtZjA3ODQ5MWI5MTcx"><div id="8f04519b-67e4-535b-b986-f078491b9171" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/07/us/trump-news-crypto#8f04519b-67e4-535b-b986-f078491b9171"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon"><img alt="John Eligon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-07T14:29:07.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 7, 2025, 9:29 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>With his latest social media post, President Trump is reopening the attacks on South Africa that he started last month over what he says is the government’s mistreatment of white farmers.
