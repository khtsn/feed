He was 58.</p><p>The cause was brain cancer, according to the National Basketball Association, which announced the news.</p><p>Mutombo did not play basketball until midadolescence, having preferred soccer as a child. An older brother, Ilo, and his father, Samuel, encouraged him to try the sport in which his outsize frame, which ultimately stretched to 7 feet 2 inches, combined with his athletic agility could be of greater benefit.</p><p>He wound up playing 18 seasons in the N.B.A. for six teams, retiring with the second-most blocked shots in league history behind Hakeem Olajuwon, another African-born center. He was known for his trademark finger wag, a provocative pose he used to dissuade shooters from challenging him at the rim.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><em>A full obituary will follow.</em></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
