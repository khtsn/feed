An agreement would be the first significant step toward de-escalation since the start of the full-scale war more than three years ago.</p><p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://t.me/UkrzalInfo/6646" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> and <a href="https://t.me/opershtab23/12797" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russia</a> traded accusations of attacks against each others’ energy infrastructure, a day after the proposed agreement was reported, highlighting the lack of trust between the two countries and how tenuous any deal would be.</p><p>Strikes against energy facilities have been a key part of both countries’ efforts to weaken the other. Russia has launched repeated attacks on Ukraine’s power grid to undermine its war effort by making life as difficult as possible for civilians, experts say. For Ukraine, strikes on Russian facilities are aimed at cutting the revenues of Russia’s sprawling oil industry, which have been used to fund the country’s military.</p><h2 id="link-5424bdc4">The Strategy Behind the Attacks</h2><p>Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/world/europe/russia-putin-ukraine-strikes.html" title="">began attacking</a> Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in October 2022 after it became clear that its initial plan to achieve a swift victory had failed. Moscow opted for a war of attrition in which Ukraine’s energy infrastructure became a key target.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia-oil-drone-attack.html" title="">began repeatedly targeting Russia’s energy infrastructure in early 2024</a>to try to inflict pain on the heart of the Russian economy — its oil and gas industry — and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-russia-oil-refineries.html" title="">limit the supply of fuel to its military</a>. Kyiv’s aim appeared to be twofold, experts say: to reduce Russia’s oil revenues, which are used to fund its military, and to produce a psychological effect by causing large-scale fires at critical infrastructure facilities.</p><p>Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have been a key part of Moscow’s effort to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-attack.html" title="">bring the country to its knees</a>. The goal, energy experts say, has been to choke off the energy resources that fuel Ukraine’s economy and ultimately its war effort. But it also appears intended to make life so unbearable for people — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/world/europe/ukraine-kyiv-power-darkness.html" title="">plunging them into cold and darkness</a> — that it breaks their morale.</p><h2 id="link-40b2c9a8">The Effect on Russia</h2><p>Over the past year, Ukrainian drones have flown deep into Russian territory, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/ukraine-russia-oil-drone.html" title="">hitting oil refineries</a>, depots, storage units, pipelines and pumping stations. The attacks have disrupted oil flows that pass through Russian seaport oil terminals and the Druzhba pipeline, which takes crude to some European countries.</p><p>That has threatened to undercut Moscow’s revenue from energy sales abroad. It has not been possible to independently determine how much of Russia’s oil revenues have been affected by the attacks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A screenshot from a video released by the Russian Emergencies Ministry appeared to show a fire at an oil storage facility in Bryansk, Russia, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Russian Emergencies Ministry, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The attacks on oil refineries reduced the country’s refining capacity by around 10 percent at one point, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-braces-oil-output-cuts-sanctions-drones-hit-2025-02-12/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to Reuters, which has been calculating the effect of damage.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Russian oil giants <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-restoring-oil-refining-capacity-knocked-out-by-drones-2024-04-15/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have also been able</a> to quickly repair some damage. </p><p>Ukraine has escalated its attacks since January, but overall they have had a limited effect, <a href="https://t.me/agentstvonews/8993" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to Russian news media.
