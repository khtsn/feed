They see their security as inextricably bound up with that of other minority groups.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Any Jew who thinks this is going to start and stop with a few Palestinian activists is fooling themselves,” Amy Spitalnick, who runs the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and identifies as a progressive Zionist, said on social media on Monday morning. “Our community should not be used as an excuse to upend democracy &amp; the rule of law.”</p><p>Mr. Khalil, who is married to an American citizen, was detained on Saturday by federal immigration officers, in a striking escalation of the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on what it sees as a scourge of antisemitism on college campuses. He is being detained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-ice-louisiana.html" title="">at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility</a> in Louisiana.

He has described his role to reporters as a negotiator and spokesman.</p><p>If the Trump administration and its partisans were united in supporting the raid, the American Jewish community, in whose name Mr. Trump appeared to say he was acting, was notably divided.</p><p>On one side were some Jewish groups like the A.D.L., which saw Hamas’s attack on Israel as inaugurating a new era of heightened antisemitism that required “bold, brave” responses.</p><p>Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, favorably contrasted the arrest in a statement with previous “drawn-out bureaucratic processes” that he said failed to address campus antisemitism. “New, aggressive, and legal tactics are clearly needed,” he said.</p><p>Ari Shrage, the co-founder of the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association, said the group’s criticism of campus protests and <a href="https://x.com/CU_JewishAlumni/status/1898819027822338104" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its praise of Mr. Khalil’s arrest</a> should not be mistaken for a desire to crack down on speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We have a problem with students taking over buildings, which prevents students from going to class, and distributing pro-Hamas materials which advocate for violence against Jews,” he said.</p><p>But for several left-wing Jewish groups, the arrest signaled creeping authoritarianism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pro-Palestinian student protesters erected an encampment at Columbia University last spring.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It is utterly despicable that they are carrying out this authoritarian lurch under the guise of fighting for Jewish safety,” Eva Borgwardt, the national spokesperson for IfNotNow, a Jewish group that is often critical of Israel, said of the Trump administration.</p><p>Sophie Ellman-Golan, the director of strategic communications for Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, added, “Jews, regardless of where they stand on political activism and organizing, feel in their bones how deeply dangerous this is.”</p><p>That sentiment was echoed during a news conference near Columbia on Monday evening by several Jewish professors and activists who accused the Trump administration of using genuine antisemitism as a pretext to further its goals of deportation and limiting free speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“What’s happening on this campus — or to this campus — is not about protecting Jews,” said Marianne Hirsch, a retired English professor and Holocaust scholar whose parents were Holocaust survivors. “Pro-Palestinian speech and activism does not mean a lack of safety for Jews,” she added.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marianne Hirsch, a Holocaust scholar, condemned Mr. Khalil’s arrest at a news conference near Columbia on Monday evening.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Joseph Howley, a classics professor at Columbia who has supported the pro-Palestinian demonstrations, said in an interview that Mr. Khalil, whom he knows, is “dedicated to negotiation, mediation and finding peaceful agreements to conflicts.”</p><p>Professor Howley also noted that Mr. Khalil did not obscure his identity. Opponents of the protests, including the A.D.L., have blamed some protesters for wearing masks to hide their faces. Several faculty members even <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/01/28/columbia-professor-submits-mask-ban-proposal-to-university-senate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed</a> a universitywide ban on face coverings at classes and other events.</p><p>But Mr. Khalil’s is a familiar face to critics and supporters alike. Over the past week, Mr. Khalil has been singled out on social media by critics of the protests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The dispute among Jewish organizations represents more than just the general polarization of American life.

But American Jews are also vigilant against antisemitism, and for many people, supporting Israel has long been central and viewed as part of that vigilance.</p><p>Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch, senior rabbi of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York City, said that defending Jews from supporters of Hamas — designated a terrorist group by the U.S. government, he noted — is of paramount concern.</p><p>At the same time, he argued for protecting civil liberties. “What I believe,” he said, “is what the mainstream of the American Jewish community believes. We have always been at the vanguard of free speech.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Jonathan Jacoby, the national director of the Nexus Project, a progressive Jewish group, expressed concern that the arrest and promised crackdown would widen divides between Jews and other minority groups.</p><p>“There has never been a safer and more flourishing experience than the American Jewish experience, living as a free people in an open society,” he said. “Anything that endangers that, or our relationships with other Americans — those are all Jewish concerns.”</p><p>Columbia became the epicenter of university protests against the war in Gaza last year when students <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/us/columbia-protests-encampment.html" title="">set up a tent city</a> on a campus lawn.</p><p>Some Jewish students joined the protests, but others said the encampments made them question their safety and sense of belonging on campus. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/nyregion/columbia-antisemitism-bias-report.html" title="">scathing report</a> on antisemitism at Columbia found that some Jewish students, particularly more religious ones who wore visible markers of their faith like head coverings, had been intimidated, harassed and physically attacked by protesters.</p><p>“Particular aspersions cast upon Jewish and Israeli students resonate with the history of antisemitism and, given what we know about the past, such representations can lead to further acts of aggression and exclusion,” the report’s authors wrote last summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Nor did the confrontational protests end last school year. In January, four masked protesters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/nyregion/barnard-college-student-sit-in.html" title="">entered</a> a class on the history of Israel taught by an Israeli professor. They accused Columbia of “normalizing genocide” and handed out antisemitic fliers.</p><p>Two of those students were expelled in February, touching off another round of protests at Barnard College, the affiliated women’s college across the street from Columbia’s main campus. Videos of an unmasked Mr. Khalil at the sit-in were soon circulated on social media among critics of Columbia’s protest movement, with some calling for him to be deported.</p><p>Shayla Colon<!-- --> and Sharla Steinman contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Tracy is a Times reporter covering arts and culture.
