It will be free but available only to the leaders of companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue.</p><p>Semafor’s newest project is the latest in a series of moves among media outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Axios and Fortune, which are battling for attention inside the C-suite.</p><p>Despite a crowded marketplace, each sees an opportunity for its newsletters and events to cater to the highest echelon of corporate leaders and to tap into a lucrative world of sponsorships and subscriptions. New sources of revenue have become increasingly important for many publications in the face of a tough digital advertising market and faltering social media traffic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It truly is an example of the reversal of this 20-year trend in media of prioritizing scale,” said Justin Smith, the chief executive and a co-founder of Semafor. He added, “We’re really not talking about small business or midsize business but the C.E.O.s of the biggest companies in the world, which is a micromarket.”</p><p>Mr. Smith said he had realized shortly after Semafor began that its journalists and articles were “tilting our whole model, at least in the initial phase of Semafor’s existence, toward a very, very clear audience segment, which I would call the global leadership class.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
