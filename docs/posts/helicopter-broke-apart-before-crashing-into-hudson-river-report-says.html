It simply laid out some of the facts that investigators gathered immediately after the tragedy on April 10 that left <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/nyregion/nyc-hudson-river-helicopter-crash-escobar.html" title="">the pilot and a family of five</a> Spanish tourists dead.</p><p>The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger operated by New York Helicopter Tours, had been flying at about 110 miles an hour over the river that afternoon, at an altitude of 625 feet to 650 feet, before it rose to about 675 and then descended rapidly, the report said. In the next seven seconds, it fell more than 550 feet before it splashed into the water without its rotor blades or tail at about 3:15 p.m.</p><p>Witnesses described hearing “several loud bangs” from the helicopter before it broke up and descended into the river, the report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The fatal crash, one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/nyregion/nyc-helicopter-crash-history.html" title="">several in the last 15 years</a> in and around New York City, has led to calls for more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/nyregion/helicopter-tours-noise-air-pollution.html" title="">restrictions on sightseeing flights</a> or outright bans on them. But the airspace is controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration, which has been reluctant to limit access.</p><p>The passengers were Agustín Escobar; his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal; and their three children, Agustín, 10; Mercè, 8; and Víctor, 4. The pilot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/nyregion/seankese-johnson-nyc-helicopter-crash.html" title="">Seankese Johnson</a>, 36, a U.S. Navy veteran who had recently started flying excursions for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/nyregion/ny-helicopter-tours-shut-down.html" title="">New York Helicopter Tours</a>, also died.</p><p>The helicopter had taken off from a port in Lower Manhattan, looped around the Statue of Liberty and headed up the river. It made a U-turn near the George Washington Bridge and was flying back on the New Jersey side of the river when it crashed.</p><p>The pilot was on the eighth flight of his first day of work after 10 regularly scheduled days off, the report said. He had a commercial pilot certificate and had logged more than 790 hours of flight time, including about 50 hours at the controls of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/nyregion/helicopter-bell-206-l-longrange.html" title="">Bell 206L-4</a>, it said.</p><p>The report said that the helicopter “suddenly separated into three major sections” — the fuselage that held the passengers and pilot, the main rotor system and the tail boom. The rotor system and tail boom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/nyregion/nyc-helicopter-crash-rotor-hudson.html" title="">were recovered</a> in about 30 feet of water, north of where the fuselage was found, the report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The investigation was hampered by the helicopter’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/nyregion/helicopter-crash-nyc-parts-missing.html" title="">lack of video or data recording devices</a>. Photos of the pilot taken just before the helicopter departed showed that he was wearing “computer-augmented sunglasses” that were capable of recording video and audio, the report said. But those sunglasses were not recovered.</p><p>A final, more conclusive report from the safety board is expected, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/nyregion/helicopter-crash-investigation.html" title="">it is likely to take several months to prepare</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick McGeehan is a Times reporter who covers the economy of New York City and its airports and other transportation hubs.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Beekeeper Charged With a Genocidal Secret:</strong> Faustin Nsabumukunzi lived quietly in New York.
