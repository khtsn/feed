Gemelli Hospital in Rome with bronchitis last Friday. Successive diagnostic tests found that he had developed pneumonia in both lungs.</p><p>He also has a polymicrobial infection, which means that he has a mix of microbes, like a virus or bacteria, in his lungs or another part of his respiratory tract. The infection required the use of cortisone antibiotic therapy, the Vatican said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>His overall health continued to be complex, the Vatican said on Tuesday evening, but it added that the pope was in “good spirits,” praying, reading and resting.</p><p>In recent years, Francis’ health has been cause for concern, and this is his fourth stay at Policlinico A. Gemelli Hospital. In 2021, he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/world/europe/pope-francis-surgery.html" title="">colon surgery</a> there. In 2023, he was admitted for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital-tests.html" title="">respiratory infection</a> and went home after three days. He was then hospitalized again a few months later to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/world/europe/pope-francis-hospital.html" title="">undergo abdominal surgery</a> for a hernia.</p><p>More than 60 years ago, Francis had an upper lobe of his right lung removed, and in recent years his breathing has seemed labored during speeches. Over the past few months, he has often asked aides to read the remarks on his behalf.</p><p>But Francis has maintained an often exhausting schedule, in particular since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/world/europe/rome-vatican-jubilee-tourism.html" title="">Roman Catholic Church’s 2025 Jubilee</a> — a year of faith, penance and forgiveness of sins that takes place every quarter-century — began on Christmas Eve.</p><p>All of his public engagements have been canceled through the weekend.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
