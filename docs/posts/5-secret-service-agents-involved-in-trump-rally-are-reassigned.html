    <h1>5 Secret Service Agents Involved in Trump Rally Are Reassigned</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On July 13, a would-be assassin climbed onto a roof on the Butler Farm Show grounds in Butler, Pa., about 450 feet from where Mr. Trump was addressing some 15,000 supporters. The man fired eight shots, killing one man and injuring Mr. Trump and two others. A Secret Service sniper posted on another roof in the area killed him with a single shot.</p><p>While dozens of Secret Service agents and officers were part of the security detail for the event, a handful had been assigned direct oversight of the plans.</p><p>For weeks, some lawmakers have been demanding that the agency fire culpable agents or, at a minimum, place them on leave. The agency’s director at the time of the rally, Kimberly A. Cheatle, resigned a day after she testified before Congress nine days after the event.</p><p>Pressed by Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/secret-service-trump-shooting-senate.html" title="">congressional hearing last month</a>, the agency’s acting director, Ronald L. Rowe Jr., explained why no one had been fired.</p><p>“I want to be neutral and make sure that we get to the bottom of it and interview everybody in order to determine if there was more than one person who perhaps exercised bad judgment,” Mr. Rowe said. “You’re asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge this was a failure of the Secret Service.”</p></div></div>
