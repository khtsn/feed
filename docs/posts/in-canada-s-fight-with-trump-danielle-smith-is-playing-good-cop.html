She has been the province’s premier since 2022.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>She’s the closest thing Canada’s conservative movement has to a MAGA ally — and has the Mar-a-Lago <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEu_cTSSZP7/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photograph</a> with Mr. Trump to prove it.</p><p>As Mr. Trump started to say he wanted to make Canada the 51st state, before being inaugurated, Ms. Smith visited him in Florida.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even before Mr. Trump’s re-election, Ms. Smith had been key in shaping the evolution of Canada’s broader conservative movement. Critics say she has courted ideological minorities, including fervent anti-vaccine organizations, advocates for Albertan secessionism and hard-line anti-trans activists, to secure her election.</p><p>She has been careful to make those groups feel included in her agenda while not fully endorsing their rhetoric.</p><p>That ability, along with the political freedom afforded by her lack of interest in national office, has put her at the vanguard of Canada’s changing right.</p><p>In recent months, Ms. Smith has defended her pro-Trump overtures as a diplomatic approach that complements the more aggressive stance taken by the federal government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Simply put, she said of her Trump ties, “I’m happy to be good cop.”</p><h2 id="link-67bd84c">Maple Leaf MAGA</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A border crossing between Canada and the United States in Coutts, Alberta. Ms. Smith has qualified her support for President Trump by saying she does not support his tariffs on Canada.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Smith’s approach is underpinned by more than admiration for Mr. Trump and his politics.</p><p>It is also driven by her province’s unusual relationship with the United States, and the rest of Canada.</p><p>“Americans helped us build our two biggest industries, our cattle industry and our oil and gas industry,” she added, sitting in her office in Calgary.</p><p>Ms. Smith has qualified her support for Mr. Trump by saying she does not support his tariffs on Canada.</p><p>“I think it’s going to hurt them — it’s going to hurt us — but I think we can probably work our way through that,” she said.</p><p>She’s had to respond to criticism and calibrate her enthusiasm in the context of Mr. Trump’s calling for the annexation of Canada — “It’s not going to happen,” she said — and his ire over Canadian goods, including Alberta’s oil, which almost entirely heads to the United States and is subject to a 10 percent tariff (although a loophole to avoid the levy was subsequently introduced).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But she was generally effusive about Mr. Trump, recalling her January visit to his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where she saw him D.J. on an iPad and hold court after a game of golf.</p><h2 id="link-701c14e5">Comeback Kids</h2><p>And, she added, much like Mr. Trump, she has her own comeback story.</p><p>More than a decade ago, Ms. Smith was leading a small right-wing party in Alberta when she decided to join the larger provincial conservative party, a move that outraged her former colleagues but that she defended as an effort to unify the province’s conservatives.</p><p>The high-risk move backfired. Ms. Smith was not selected by the party to be a candidate for her electoral district and left politics for years.</p><p>In 2022, she came roaring back, winning her bid to lead Alberta’s United Conservative Party and then a provincial election to become premier.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Smith left politics for years and came roaring back in 2022.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>To win, she took the opposite approach to the one she had tried a decade ago: Instead of tacking to the center, she led the party’s expansion to the right. She secured the support of libertarian grass-roots organizations, including a prominent citizens’ group that had organized around anti-vaccine mandates, as well as a movement seeking Albertan independence from the rest of Canada.</p><p>Albertan independence, in fact, would become a pressing question.</p><h2 id="link-4128962d">Western Promises</h2><p>Ms. Smith has sought to use the question of Alberta’s relationship with the rest of Canada to her political advantage.</p><p>Many Albertans — not just the ones supporting independence — say that their province’s energy riches are being exploited by a federal government that takes revenues from them to bankroll poorer parts of the country.</p><p>And they rail against Ottawa for introducing climate policies that limit the province’s ability to extract and sell energy products.</p><p>Asked explicitly if she supported Alberta’s splitting away, Ms. Smith said, “We should go back to what the Constitution says,” referring to Canada’s federal system, in which provinces have power to manage several important policy areas. “The Constitution gives us areas of exclusive jurisdiction that the federal government keeps invading and trying to undermine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Secessionism advocates see, in Ms. Smith, an ally. Her chief of staff is a co-author of a crucial document, the <a href="https://www.freealbertastrategy.com/the_strategy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Free Alberta Strategy</a>, which lays out the reasoning for independence.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Canadian and American flags hanging in  the window of a home in Edmonton, Alberta.

It remains a minority view, though a <a href="https://angusreid.org/smith-shapiro-sovereignty/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent poll from the Angus Reid Institute</a> indicated support could grow if the Liberal Party won the upcoming federal election.</p><p>Ms. Smith has pledged to explore the idea of holding an independence referendum after that election and has threatened a rupture with the federal government to gain concessions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Last month, after meeting Prime Minister <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/canada/mark-carney-liberal-election.html" title="">Mark Carney</a>, the Liberal leader in the elections, she said that she had “provided a specific list of demands the next prime minister, regardless of who that is, must address within the first six months of their term to avoid an unprecedented national unity crisis.”</p><p>The demands included several policies to bolster the province’s energy sector.</p><h2 id="link-172d3fc4">Blessing and Curse</h2><p>Ms. Smith is playing a key role in mobilizing support for the federal Conservative leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/canada/pierre-poilievre-conservative-party-trump.html" title="">Pierre Poilievre</a>, who is vying to become the country’s next prime minister and was also born in Alberta.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative Party leader running to lead Canada. The election is set for April 28.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Together, Ms. Smith and Mr. Poilievre are defining a brand of Canadian conservatism focused on culture issues, limiting the government’s role in public and private life, and an anti-elite, anti-federal approach to running Canada. If Mr. Poilievre loses the election, that vision could be in jeopardy.</p><p>Both politicians supported the so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/world/americas/canada-trucker-protest.html" title="">Freedom Convoy</a>, a movement with strong appeal in Alberta that began as a protest against Covid vaccine mandates for truck drivers, drew in other groups, turned violent in places and paralyzed the nation’s capital for weeks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>But Ms. Smith’s embrace can be a double-edged sword, as Mr. Poilievre is discovering.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/08/exclusive-canadian-premier-danielle-smith-trudeau-blew-tariff-negotiations-first-mar-a-lago-meeting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breitbart interview</a> last month, she said that Mr. Poilievre was “in sync” with Mr. Trump and that she had asked the White House to “put things on pause” — a reference to the hostile climate between the two countries — until the election.</p><p>Critics said her remarks were an invitation to Washington to interfere with Canada’s elections in favor of Mr. Poilievre, whose combative style bears similarities to Mr. Trump&#39;s. Mr. Poilievre has seen his once-large lead over the Liberals evaporate in the run-up to the vote, partly because many Canadians now consider Mr. Trump a major threat.</p><p>But Ms. Smith was, again, unapologetic, insisting that she was trying to do what was best for Canada, not just for Mr. Poilievre.</p><h2 id="link-17feedfa">Right All Along</h2><p>With Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Ms. Smith seems to feel that, finally, her ideological side is winning.</p><p>She delights at Mr. Trump’s assault on what she calls “wokeism.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Smith is playing a major role in mobilizing support for Mr. Poilievre.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>But the policy area where her alignment with Mr. Trump’s movement is most pronounced is probably health. In fact, Ms. Smith says that Alberta has been leading the way.</p><p>“We were at the front end on protecting the choice of kids through the trans policy changes that we’ve made,” she added, referring to Alberta’s passing legislation limiting access to gender-affirming medical interventions for minors and other policies targeting transgender children.</p><p>Ms. Smith has opposed any mandatory vaccination, despite measles outbreaks in Canada and in the United States.</p><p>“Parents are pretty discerning,’’ she said. “They’re able to know which vaccines are best for their kids.”</p><h2 id="link-589a286">Call In</h2><p>While Ms. Smith has been at the forefront of the country’s hottest political debates, she still seems most comfortable on Alberta’s radio waves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>She takes questions from Albertans on a regular call-in program called “Your Province. Your Premier.”</p><p>She listens attentively and offers a smiling reply, no matter the topic, that unfailingly makes the caller feel as if they are making a really good point, however unreasonable it may be.</p><p>She credits her years as a call-in radio host for learning to listen to everyone, a quality that makes her likable, as even some of her harshest critics concede.</p><p>“I just would rather hear people out; it’s just the nice, polite thing to do,” she said, adding a rare reference to Canada rather than Alberta: “Maybe it’s just a Canadian thing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Smith during a session of the radio call-in program “Your Province.
