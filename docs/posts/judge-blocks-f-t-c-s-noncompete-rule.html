Her decision on Tuesday renders that injunction permanent, and nationwide in scope.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Banning noncompete agreements would increase workers’ earnings by at least $400 billion over the next decade, the F.T.C. has estimated. The agreements affect roughly one in five American workers, or around 30 million people, according to the agency, whose purview includes antitrust and consumer protection issues.</p><p>Victoria Graham, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, said the agency was disappointed by Judge Brown’s decision and would “keep fighting to stop noncompetes that restrict the economic liberty of hardworking Americans, hamper economic growth, limit innovation and depress wages.”</p><p>“We are seriously considering a potential appeal, and today’s decision does not prevent the F.T.C. from addressing noncompetes through case-by-case enforcement actions,” Ms. Graham added.</p><p>A tax firm, Ryan, sued to block the rule just hours after the F.T.C. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/business/noncompete-clause-ban.html" title="">voted 3 to 2 in April to adopt</a> it. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce later joined the case as a plaintiff, as did the Business Roundtable and two Texas business groups.</p><p>The Chamber of Commerce and other groups have asserted that the F.T.C. lacks constitutional and statutory authority to adopt the rule, with Ryan calling it “arbitrary, capricious and otherwise unlawful” — a position with which Judge Brown agreed. Business groups have also argued that the ban would limit their ability to protect trade secrets and confidential information.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In response to Judge Brown’s ruling, G. Brint Ryan, chief executive of Ryan, called the rule “continuing overreach and overregulation” by the federal government, adding that the firm was “happy we were able to successfully stop the overreach in this instance.”</p><p>But the three Democrats on the five-member F.T.C. maintain that it can legally issue rules defining unfair methods of competition under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, the law that created the agency.</p><p>In a separate case, a federal judge in Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/business/economy/noncompete-ban-ftc.html" title="">declined last month</a> to block the rule. Diverging rulings on the fate of the ban could leave the door open to review by higher courts.</p><p>“Many businesses will welcome the reprieve, but the uncertainty continues as the fight now moves to the appellate courts,” said Kevin Goldstein, an antitrust partner at Winston &amp; Strawn.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>A Federal Judge Blocks the F.T.C.’s Noncompete Rule<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Internet’s Biggest Scammer: </strong>An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/14/technology/elon-musk-ai-deepfake-scam.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">A.I.-powered deepfake of Elon Musk</a> has appeared in thousands of inauthentic ads on social media, contributing to billions in fraud.</p></li><li><p><strong>Print Is No Joke for The Onion:</strong> The satirical site is hoping a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/business/media/the-onion-print-paper.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">new print edition</a> with fake stories and fake ads will lead to real money.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Crypto Dream Unravels: </strong>An entrepreneur arrived in Puerto Rico in 2017, promising to use crypto magic to revitalize the economy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/brock-pierce-crypto-puerto-rico.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">But his vision has yet to materialize</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Hotelification of Offices: </strong>Hoping to lure workers back to their desks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/business/office-design-work-resort.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">companies are designing “work resorts”</a> that are meant to match or surpass the comfort of employees’ homes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bari Weiss Knows What She’s Doing: </strong>The founder of The Free Press has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">built a new media empire</a> by persuading audiences that she is a teller of dangerous truths.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div></div></div>
