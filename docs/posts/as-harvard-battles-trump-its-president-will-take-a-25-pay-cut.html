Garber, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/harvard-president-alan-garber.html" title="">became Harvard’s permanent leader</a> last year. His recent predecessors were paid around $1 million a year.</p><p>Whatever it amounts to in dollar terms, though, the pay reduction is a symbolic gesture compared with the scale of the university’s fight with the federal government, which has already moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/trump-harvard-grants-450-million.html" title="">block more than $2.6 billion in funding</a> for Harvard.</p><p>A university spokesman, Jonathan L. Swain, said Dr. Garber’s salary would be reduced starting July 1, when Harvard’s next fiscal year begins. The university, which has already halted new hiring and suspended merit raises for many employees, said that other Harvard leaders were also volunteering to accept changes to their pay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The university acknowledged Dr. Garber’s decision the day after it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/harvard-trump-lawsuit.html" title="">expanded its lawsuit</a> against the Trump administration.</p><p>The government made a range of intrusive demands of Harvard last month, asserting that the university had, among other things, not done enough to combat antisemitism. The university has sharply contested those accusations. Then last week, Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said that Harvard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html" title="">would not be eligible</a> for any more federal grants.</p><p>Legal experts have cast doubt on the viability of Ms. McMahon’s decree, and many of them believe that Harvard has a strong legal case to reverse the cuts the Trump administration has already made. Even so, Harvard, which has routinely received hundreds of millions of dollars a year in federal research funding, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/harvard-trump-court-case-negotiation.html" title="">preparing for turmoil</a> as long as President Trump remains in office.</p><p>In the first months of Mr. Trump’s second term, Harvard has already had to scale back or eliminate some research programs, including efforts to study tuberculosis, Lou Gehrig’s disease and radiation sickness, because of federal funding cuts. The university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, faced with some of the most significant funding losses, is eliminating desktop phones, limiting catering, reducing security and cutting back on purchases of new computers. The school has also cut back on leased office space, slots for doctoral students and a shuttle that ferries employees between offices.</p><p>The Crimson, the Harvard campus newspaper, first reported Dr. Garber’s pay decision.</p><p>A sense of campus solidarity in the funding fight extends beyond Harvard’s top ranks. Ninety tenured professors have pledged to take 10 percent pay cuts in order to help Harvard, the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university, weather the Trump administration’s onslaught. Ryan D. Enos, a professor of government and a leader of the group, said the university had expressed its gratitude.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The group came together, Dr. Enos said, in recognition that some Harvard employees could be harder hit than others by the federal cuts.</p><p>In a statement, the professors, some of whom have not been named publicly, said their offer to work for less pay signaled “our commitment as faculty members to use means at our disposal to protect the university and, especially, staff and students who do not have the same protections.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Blinder is a national correspondent for The Times, covering education.</p></div><div><p>Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Education in America</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Morehouse College Names New President:</strong> As historically Black colleges grapple with the Trump administration’s intentions for campuses nationwide, the storied Atlanta school named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/morehouse-college-president-hbcu-trump.html">F.
