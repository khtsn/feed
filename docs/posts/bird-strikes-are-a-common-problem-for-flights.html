Most of those strikes involved birds, but the F.A.A.’s definition of a wildlife strike also includes coyotes, deer and bats.</p><p>In the United States in 2023, 19,603 wildlife strikes were reported, which averages out to about 54 strikes each day, according to the aviation administration’s report. Of those strikes, 3.6 percent caused damage.</p><p>Here are some notable episodes when a bird strike was found to have contributed to an aviation accident.</p><h2 id="link-7b3f16fe">A Boeing 737 Max Crash in Ethiopia</h2><p>The March 2019 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/09/business/boeing-737-crash-anniversary.html" title="">killed all 157 people on board</a>, happened less than five months after another Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/world/asia/boeing-737-max-lion-air-crash.html" title="">in Indonesia</a>, killing all 189 people on board.</p><p>Both crashes were attributed in part to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/business/boeing-737-max-crash.html" title="">faulty flight control system</a> with the 737 Max, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/boeing-737-max-airlines-flying-travel.html" title="">temporarily grounded</a> after the Ethiopian Airlines crash.</p><p>In that latter crash, the National Transportation Safety Board said <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20230124.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in January 2023</a>, a bad sensor reading was caused by an object, most likely a bird. That bad reading activated the flawed flight control system called MCAS, which pitched the nose of the plane downward shortly after the plane left Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, for Nairobi, Kenya, causing the crash.</p><h2 id="link-160809a9">‘Miracle on the Hudson’</h2><p>Shortly after a US Airways flight took off from LaGuardia Airport in January 2009, headed to Charlotte, N.C., the airplane struck a flock of geese, disabling the plane.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>All 155 people aboard a US Airways flight survived when it landed in the Hudson River after striking a flock of geese in January 2009.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Appleton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The pilot, Chesley B. Sullenberger III, determined that the safest option was to land in the icy waters of the Hudson River near midtown Manhattan.</p><p>The maneuver was a success, and all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/16/nyregion/16usair.html" title="">155 people on board</a> survived the water landing and ensuing evacuation on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/nyregion/17about.html" title="">boats and ferries</a>.</p><h2 id="link-71180cd3">A Deadly Air Force Crash in Alaska</h2><p>One of the deadliest aircraft accidents <a href="https://www.pacom.mil/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/2360411/remembering-fallen-yukla-27-crew/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Air Force history</a> took place on Sept. 22, 1995, when 24 Canadian and American airmen were killed after two of their plane’s engines swallowed Canada geese, causing the plane to crash at Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska.</p><p>The plane, an E-3 Sentry surveillance aircraft with the call sign “Yukla 27,” took off just as a flock of geese took flight from the airfield and crossed into the airplane’s path. Two of the engines ingested birds, which caused the plane to make an uncontrollable roll to the left.</p><h2 id="link-53d0213f">A Jet Struck a Flock of Pigeons in Ethiopia</h2><p>An Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed <a href="https://asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/326469" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in September 1988</a>, killing 35 of the 104 people on board, after it struck a flock of pigeons as it was taking off from Bahir Dar Airport in northern Ethiopia.</p><p>Both engines on the plane, a Boeing 737, had ingested birds, causing problems that required the pilot to make an emergency return to the airport. The plane caught fire during the crash landing in a clearing near the airport.</p><h2 id="link-33d949ba">An Eastern Airlines Crash in Boston Harbor</h2><p>One of the deadliest crashes caused by a bird strike took place on <a href="https://www.faa.gov/lessons_learned/transport_airplane/accidents/N5533" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oct. 4, 1960</a>, on an Eastern Airlines flight that left from Logan International Airport in Boston. Of the 72 people on board, 62 died after the plane crashed into Boston Harbor.</p><p>The aircraft, a Lockheed L-188 Electra, struck a large flock of starlings immediately after takeoff. Three of the plane’s engines swallowed birds, causing a loss of control of the plane.</p><p>After the crash, engineers and regulators came to better understand that birds could pose serious problems for airplanes, leading to the creation of specific standards to make planes more resistant to bird strikes.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
