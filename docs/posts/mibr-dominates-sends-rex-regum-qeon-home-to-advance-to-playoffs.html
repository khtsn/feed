<p>The series was played out on RRQ&#39;s pick of Corrode and MIBR&#39;s Abyss. MIBR won both maps comfortably, winning 13-5 on both maps. </p>

<p>On Corrode, RRQ went for the chaotic double Duelist comp that they have tended to play on the map. The comp, pairing <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8497/monyet">
		Monyet	</a>
</span>&#39;s Neon and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/24895/jemkin">
		Jemkin	</a>
</span>&#39;s Waylay, was complemented by a Viper-Omen double-Controller duo, with Fade as the Initiator in a zero-Sentinel comp. Meanwhile, MIBR went for a double-Controller, double-Initiator comp, with in-game leader <span data-ref-id="4">

</span> on KAY/O. Viper, Omen, and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8480/aspas">
		aspas	</a>
</span> on Waylay rounded out the rest of the comp. </p>

<p>MIBR&#39;s attack side was dominant. They won seven of the first eight rounds, fueled by a 4-0 start to the map. The string of defeats made it tough for Jemkin to get maximum value out of the Operator, as he ended the map with just two kills with the long sniper. MIBR&#39;s double-Initiator setup used an info-heavy approach, which helped the side get onto site with little to no issue, resulting in plants being secured in all 12 rounds of the team&#39;s attack half.</p>

<p><em>artzin is up and out of his seat after a nice ace.</em></p>

<p>After entering halftime up 9-3, MIBR started the second half with yet another pistol round win. Though RRQ&#39;s two Duelists threatened to wreak havoc, they couldn&#39;t do much. The next four rounds were split 2-2, with MIBR eventually winning 13-5.</p>

<p>artzin had a map to remember, finishing with a game-high 21 kills, while aspas was his usual self with 19 of his own. The duo went 4-1 and 4-0 in first duels, respectively, often acting as the literal first punch of MIBR&#39;s attack.</p>

<p>After stealing their opponents&#39; map picks, MIBR looked to close up shop quickly. With RRQ banning Bind, arguably one of MIBR&#39;s strongest maps, in the veto process, Abyss was MIBR&#39;s pick. Both teams deployed near-mirror comps on the map, featuring KAY/O, Sova, and Cypher, with the Duelists on Jett. </p>

<p>Starting on defense, MIBR won the pistol, anti-eco, and bonus rounds. From that point on, any added rounds could be seen as insurance before moving over to attack, but the MIBR players did more than give themselves a cushion. MIBR dropped RRQ&#39;s first buy round, but won five straight rounds. </p>

<p>Facing an 8-1 deficit on attack, RRQ needed a hero, and seemed to have found one. After a second timeout call in the half from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8347/ewok">
		Ewok	</a>
</span>, RRQ won the next three rounds, thanks in no small part to 11 kills in that span from Duelist <span data-ref-id="8">

</span>. </p>

<p><em>aspas finds four with the Operator.</em></p>

<p>Facing an 8-4 halftime deficit, RRQ was tasked with a crucial pistol round that, on attack, could help the team snowball forwards. While Jemkin was, once again, not allowed to pick up the Operator on Abyss defense side consistently, aspas had little to no issue grabbing one on MIBR&#39;s defense side of the map. </p>

<p>MIBR grabbed a fourth pistol round to start the half, extending the lead in that category to 4-0 and capitalizing to win a total of eight rounds in the series with all four anti-eco rounds converted. MIBR suffered a hiccup at match point, up 12-4, but quickly closed up shop the next round to win 13-5.</p>

<p><span data-ref-id="9">

		xenom	</a>
</span>, on Astra, finished with a map-high 1.44 rating, one of his best performances in the second half of the year so far, while aspas&#39;s 17 kills were second to none. </p>

<p>aspas&#39;s server-high 36 kills saw the Duelist player finish +22, while artzin&#39;s 30 and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5395/cortezia">
		cortezia	</a>
</span>&#39;s 27 were the icing on a cake for a dominant MIBR victory.</p>

<p>The group stages have now wrapped up, with all eight playoff spots claimed. MIBR will advance to the playoffs as Group B&#39;s second seed, while RRQ has been dealt a swift elimination on the international stage yet again after a two-match run at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/playoffs" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>.</p>

<p>VCT Champions Paris action will resume with the playoffs after a two-day break.</p>
