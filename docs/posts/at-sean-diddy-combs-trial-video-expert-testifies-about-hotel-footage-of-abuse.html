After that footage was broadcast, Mr. Combs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video-response.html" title="">apologized</a> on social media, saying “my behavior on that video is inexcusable.”</p><p>The footage has become a key part of the government’s case, which charges Mr. Combs with sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, but Mr. Combs’s lawyers have also raised questions about how CNN’s video was edited, saying that some of the events were depicted out of sequence, and parts were sped up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Piazza showed a “corrected” compilation of the videos that standardized the speed of the footage and put the events in order, matched to a time code that had been set by the hotel’s security system when it was recorded.</p><p>When asked by Madison Smyser, a prosecutor, whether the video sources he used for his compilation were “reliable depictions” of what the hotel surveillance system captured, Mr. Piazza agreed, and said that they showed no signs of tampering.</p><p>Even though the footage has been shown in court numerous times since the start of Mr. Combs’s trial, it still has a visible effect on people in the courtroom. At the point when Mr. Combs drags Ms. Ventura, a female juror wiped her brow and nodded with her lips pursed; Mr. Combs, seated with his legal team, sighed at the point when he is seen throwing Ms. Ventura to the ground.</p><p>During cross-examination, parts of the footage were shown yet again, with Teny Geragos, a defense lawyer, highlighting slight gaps in the video time codes. Mr. Piazza said those had likely been caused by data corruption in the hotel’s surveillance system or by moments when the cameras detected no motion.</p><p>In addition to analyzing the hotel footage, Mr. Piazza was hired by prosecutors to “enhance” 10 sexually explicit videos from a laptop that Ms. Ventura turned over to the government. Those videos — along with another on which Mr. Piazza said he enhanced the audio — were submitted as evidence under seal and may be shown to jurors later in the trial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The racketeering charge against Mr. Combs involves accusations that the mogul engaged an inner circle of bodyguards and high-ranking employees to help him commit a series of crimes over two decades.</p><p>Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyers have said that he and his employees were involved in legitimate business operations, not a criminal conspiracy, and that the sex at issue in the government’s case was entirely consensual.</p><p>Bryana Bongolan, the woman who is expected to testify later today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/sean-combs-diddy-lawsuits-accusations.html" title="">filed a lawsuit</a> against Mr. Combs last year. In her complaint, Ms. Bongolan, a friend of Ms. Ventura, said she had been staying in Ms. Ventura’s Los Angeles apartment when, early one morning in 2016, Mr. Combs stormed in, yelled at Ms. Bongolan and held her over the balcony railing — “with only Combs’ grip keeping her from falling to her death” — before he pulled her back and slammed her onto a patio table.</p><p>Ms. Bongolan will testify under an immunity order by the court, after telling the government that she intended to assert her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself.</p><p>Her full account has been anticipated for months. The government’s indictment made brief mention of what appears to be Ms. Bongolan’s account, saying that “on one occasion, Combs dangled a female victim over an apartment balcony.” There was also a reference to her story in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">Ms. Ventura’s bombshell civil suit</a> in November 2023, which led to the government’s investigation and Mr. Combs’s arrest.</p><p>After Ms. Bongolan’s suit was filed, representatives for Mr. Combs said he <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sean-combs-sued-for-threatening-to-kill-woman-and-dangling-her-off-balcony-1235179912/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> her allegations, and said they would “ultimately be proven baseless.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Prosecutors, nearing the halfway point of what may be an eight-week trial, said they will soon call “Jane,” the second woman — after Ms. Ventura — who the government says was a victim of sex trafficking by Mr. Combs.</p><p>In their opening statements, the prosecution and the defense portrayed Jane, who is testifying under a pseudonym, in stark contrast.</p><p>Emily A. Johnson, a prosecutor, described Jane as a single mother who began spending time with Mr. Combs in 2020 and soon fell in love with him. “For the first few months, their sex life was just the two of them and Jane was happy,” Ms. Johnson said. “That was until the defendant introduced Jane to freak-offs.” Mr. Combs, the government said, “had her take drugs to stay awake and aroused for days,” and she once vomited after sex with an escort.</p><p>In the defense’s opening statement, Ms. Geragos described Jane as a willing participant in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/arts/music/freak-offs-diddy-sex-trafficking.html" title="">freak-offs</a>, saying that soon after their relationship began, Mr. Combs suggested a threesome with another man. “The evidence will show you,” Ms. Geragos told the jurors, “that she did it over and over again for three years because she made the choice.”</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
