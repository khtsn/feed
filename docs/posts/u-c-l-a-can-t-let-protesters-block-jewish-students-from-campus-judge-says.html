Scarsi’s preliminary injunction order came after three Jewish students sued the university over protests in the spring concerning Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The demonstrations roiled the campus, and more than 200 people were arrested after pro-Palestinian protests and pro-Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/03/us/ucla-protests-encampment-violence.html" title="">counterprotests turned violent</a>. </p><p>During those demonstrations, pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment with plywood and metal barricades in Royce Quad, a major thoroughfare. The judge said they had “established checkpoints and required passers-by to wear a specific wristband to cross them,” blocking “people who supported the existence of the state of Israel” from entering the encampment and other areas of the campus. </p><p>Judge Scarsi said that constitutional protections for religious freedom prohibited the university from allowing such encampments to stand<span>  </span>if they prevented the campus from being “fully and equally accessible to Jewish students.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Jewish students were excluded from portions of the U.C.L.A. campus because they refused to denounce their faith,” Judge Scarsi wrote in the order. “This fact is so unimaginable and so abhorrent to our constitutional guarantee of religious freedom that it bears repeating.”</p><p>Judge Scarsi said that U.C.L.A. had argued that it “has no responsibility to protect the religious freedom of its Jewish students because the exclusion was engineered by third-party protesters.” But he said it did not matter who blocked the students. </p><p>Lawyers for the students said the injunction was the first in the nation against what they called “an antisemitic encampment.” </p><p>“A public university is not allowed to have facilities and parts of the campus that are closed off to Jews,” Mark Rienzi, a lawyer for the students, said Wednesday in an interview. “You’re just not allowed to run a campus where you have a Jew-free quad any more than you’d have a Black-free quad or a woman-free quad.”</p><p>U.C.L.A. said Wednesday that it was committed to preventing religious discrimination and objected to having the court tell it how to manage demonstrations.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“U.C.L.A. is committed to fostering a campus culture where everyone feels welcome and free from intimidation, discrimination and harassment,” Mary Osako, the university’s vice chancellor for strategic communications, said in a statement. “The district court’s ruling is improper and would hamstring our ability to respond to events on the ground.”</p><p>Thomas Harvey, a Los Angeles-based civil rights lawyer representing Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said the judge had overreached with the injunction, which he said “paves the way for total removal of pro-Palestinian activity on campus.”</p><p>“If the sincerely held religious belief being protected here is the belief in the Jewish state of Israel, any class, campus event or speaker that criticizes that nation’s legal or political decisions might be prohibited,” he said. </p><p>Last spring, dozens of pro-Palestinian encampments sprang up at campuses across the nation. Many, including at U.C.L.A., were broken up by the police, leading to more than 3,100 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/campus-protests-arrests.html" title="">arrests</a> nationwide and, in some cases, physical confrontations. </p><p>Amid the clashes, some Jewish students said they felt threatened and intimidated by the encampments. Protesters countered thatthey were exercising their rights to free speech.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The complaint against U.C.L.A., filed by Yitzchok Frankel, Joshua Ghayoum and Eden Shemuelian, detailed what the students experienced during the spring protests. Calling the encampment and the surrounding area “the Jew Exclusion Zone,” the complaint said students were often asked if they were Zionist and were denied passage for wearing a Star of David necklace. The complaint also described Mr. Ghayoum being denied entrance to a building because he was not wearing a red wristband, which demonstrators handed out to identify students they allowed in. </p><p>In the Tuesday order, Judge Scarsi, who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump, was careful to say that he was not trying to judge the merits of the war or those of the protest and counterprotest movements related to it.</p><p>U.C.L.A. said that since the spring protests, it had taken remedial actions for students’ safety, such as creating a new Office of Campus Safety, according to court papers. But Judge Scarsi was skeptical that those measures were enough to prevent similar blockades, as students and faculty are set to return to campus in a few weeks.</p><p>Judge Scarsi noted that the constitutional problems would arise if the university again allowed protests that blocked parts of the campus for Jewish students. </p><p>“Given the risk that protests will return in the fall that will again restrict certain Jewish students’ access to ordinarily available programs, activities and campus areas, the court finds that plaintiffs are likely to suffer an irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction,” the judge’s order said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
