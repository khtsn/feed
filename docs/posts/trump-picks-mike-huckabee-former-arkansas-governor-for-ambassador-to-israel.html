Trump has selected Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, to be his ambassador to Israel, choosing a loyal ally for a crucial foreign post at a time of crisis in the Middle East.</p><p>If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Huckabee, a former pastor who has never served as an overseas diplomat, would play a crucial role in helping Mr. Trump’s quest to fulfill his promise to bring the war in Gaza to a swift close.</p><p>“Mike has been a great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East!”</p><p>Mr. Huckabee has voiced staunch support for Israel as it conducts its war in Gaza, which began after Hamas led an attack on the country on Oct. 7, 2023. In August, he said <a href="https://x.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/1829757918234685855" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that Hamas must “release ALL hostages &amp; unconditionally surrender.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump said earlier this week that he would ask another vocal supporter of Israel, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, to serve as U.N. ambassador.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump frequently presented himself as Israel’s strongest ally, and has voiced support for that country’s right to defend itself. He has been less clear about how he would bring the conflict in Gaza to an end, but analysts believe he is likely to steer U.S. foreign policy toward terms more favorable to Israel.</p><p>Mr. Huckabee was the governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007, then ran for president in both 2008 and 2016. His daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is the governor of Arkansas and has served as Mr. Trump’s White House press secretary.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Gold is a political correspondent for The Times covering the campaigns of Donald J.
