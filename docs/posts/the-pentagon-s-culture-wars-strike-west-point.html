as defense secretary, Pete Hegseth directed the military service academies to scrub their curriculum of ideologies President Trump had deemed “divisive,” “un-American” and “irrational.”</p><p>Hours later, department heads at West Point sent civilian and military professors emails asking for their course syllabuses.</p><p>Some professors said they assumed the school would defend its academic program. Instead, the U.S. Military Academy’s leaders initiated a schoolwide push to remove any readings that focused on race, gender or the darker moments of American history, according to interviews with more than a dozen West Point civilian and military staff. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media without the academy’s approval.</p><p>Two classes — an English and a history course — were scrapped midsemester for noncompliance with the new policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A history professor who leads a course on genocide was instructed not to mention atrocities committed against Native Americans, according to several academy officials.

The lesson noted that Kant was also a proponent of racial hierarchies, and it encouraged cadets to wrestle with the contradiction.</p><p>West Point administrators decided in early February that the lesson violated Mr. Hegseth’s order. Instead of teaching it, one philosophy instructor devoted the day’s class to Plato’s Apology, which chronicles Socrates’ defense at his trial for impiety and the corruption of Athenian youth.
