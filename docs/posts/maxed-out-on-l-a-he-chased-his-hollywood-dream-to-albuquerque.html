He had undergone several surgeries to repair hernias he suffered from lifting large carts containing monitors and computers, and now a mesh implant had become entangled with his intestines.</p><p>His recovery kept him out of work for months, during which his disability payments only covered a portion of what he could have earned. He and his wife had the sinking feeling that living in a costly city like Los Angeles no longer made sense.</p><p>“We wanted to slow down, go where the mortgage and car insurance was cheaper, where, if I needed to exit the film business, I could survive on getting a blue-collar job,” Mr. Riveros said.</p><p>Los Angeles had long been the center of his universe. It was where he was raised and where he met his wife, Suzette, back when she was a lead server at the Hard Rock Cafe. And it was, of course, a mecca for those in the film and television industry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Riveros, 50, had managed to stitch together a career in Hollywood as a digital imaging technician, a position in which he helps refine camera footage to improve its appearance.</p><p>The work had come with unbelievable highs. The time he was filming in the middle of Red Square in Moscow with Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. The time, on a break during production, he challenged Adam Sandler to a game of one-on-one on the Lakers’ home court. (“I had one of the best games of my entire life. I smoked him.”)</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
