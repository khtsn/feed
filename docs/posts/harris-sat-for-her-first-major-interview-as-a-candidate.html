Harris’s nascent campaign has fueled a surge in enthusiasm among Democratic voters, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">significant uptick in the polls</a>. But she has mostly avoided extended engagements with journalists.</p><p>“We have not had a chance to hear her be pressed on specific policy issues, nor has she dealt with even remotely challenging questions about what her administration would be like,” our politics reporter Reid Epstein told me.</p><p>When Harris is asked about policy, Reid said, it will be interesting to see if she engages with the details or mostly tries to turn the conversation toward warnings about Donald Trump. Her answers could help define her campaign for voters, and will test her political dexterity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years was confirmed in a baby, Abdul Rahman Abu al-Jidyan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ramadan Abed/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-71664173">Israel agreed to pauses in the war for polio vaccinations</h2><p>Starting this weekend, Israel will temporarily pause its military operations in specific areas of Gaza to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/29/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war" title="">allow health workers to give polio vaccinations</a> to about 640,000 children under the age of 10, according to the U.N.

We love having the power to reward good work and punish bad service. However, many of us complain that tipping has gotten out of hand — especially when a convenience store or a self-service checkout asks for 20, or even 30, percent.</p><p>Despite the gripes, you are likely to hear more about tipping in the coming months. Both Trump and Harris support a tax exemption for tips. On “The Daily,” my colleague Ben Casselman explained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/podcasts/the-daily/tipping-trump-harris.html" title="">how tipping exploded, and what economists think of the no tax on tips debate</a>.</p><p><strong>Need tipping advice: </strong>We talked to experts and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/your-money/tipping-self-checkout-inflation.html" title="">consulted polls for guidance</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophia Foster-Dimino</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-5ce42b26">What school nurses want parents to know</h2><p>School nurses see parents making the same mistakes, year after year.
