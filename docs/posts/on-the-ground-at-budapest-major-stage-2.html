		<p>Riot Games has <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-AU/news/update-to-valorant-esports-in-oceania" target="_blank">announced</a> the sunsetting of Challengers Oceania in 2026, and significant changes leading up to the new Pacific Path to Champions.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/576495/riot-reveals-updates-to-challengers-pacific-in-2026" target="_blank">announced earlier in October</a>, the Pacific Path to Champions was introduced as the new pathway for Challengers and Tier 2 level teams to fight for a spot at the Pacific Stage 2 Playoffs and a chance to qualify all the way to Champions. While Pacific will allocate four slots for Challengers teams, Oceania was not guaranteed one; instead the top team from Oceania will compete in a Last Chance Qualifier against the top team from South Asia and the 2nd and 3rd seed from Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The decision to sunset Challengers in the region, as explained by Riot, were mostly in part due to a lack of growth within the local ecosystem and an imbalance between the demand of operating the tournament and the interest from the viewership and the players participating. Riot also has expressed plans to increase support for future grassroots and community events, as well as maintaining that Game Changers Oceania will continue to run in 2026.</p>

<p>However, Riot pressed that Oceania teams will continue its competitive structure through the existing Path to Pro and Premier tournament system, where top teams from each 2026 Premier Acts will feed into an Oceania regional qualifier which will send a team to the aforementioned Last Chance Qualifier. In addition, the top teams from the last 3 Acts of 2025 are directly invited into the Invite Division for V26A1 where they will compete against other Premier teams for points.</p>
