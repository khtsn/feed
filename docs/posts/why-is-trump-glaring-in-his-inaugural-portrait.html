Trump. There has been such a stampede of big-money donors that his inaugural committee has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trump-inauguration-donors.html" title="">run out of V.I.P. tickets</a> and perks. And yet here is the president-elect, positively glaring in the official photograph his aides released on Thursday in advance of his inauguration.</p><p>The image, which will be printed inside the programs his supporters will clutch come Monday morning, does not exactly scream celebration. Mr. Trump is shown sternly squinting, bathed in eerie, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/movies/david-lynch-eraserhead-mulholland-drive.html" title="">David Lynchian</a> lighting from below, high-powered strobes reflected in his eyes. One entertainment photographer said the lighting and technique is reminiscent of the photographer Jill Greenberg’s controversial “<a href="https://slate.com/culture/2013/08/jill-greenberg-end-times-crying-children-photos-became-a-headache-for-the-photographer-photos.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">End Times</a>” series of crying children.</p><p>Whereas other men on the cusp of the presidency have offered anodyne, smiling inaugural images, the photo revealed on Thursday was — as with all things Trump — dramatic and startling. It is certainly reminiscent of the purposeful pose he struck for his 2024 mug shot, taken by the Fulton County, Georgia, sheriff’s office in that state’s election interference case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s booking photo in Fulton County, Georgia, for that state’s election interference case.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fulton County Sheriff&#39;S Office/REUTERS, via Via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Asked to interpret the president-elect’s expression in his inauguration photo, his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, replied: “America. Is. Back.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As a subject, Mr. Trump “knows what he’s looking for,” said Shealah Craighead, the chief White House photographer during his first administration. “He’s very hands-on. He will ask to see the photos on the back of the camera or on a computer screen while it’s happening in real time so he can decide if it’s headed in the right direction. If he likes what he sees, then he will ask to see tangible paper prints rather than on a computer.”</p><p>Some saw in the image a signal of the retribution and strong hand that Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail. Many of his supporters erupted in glee about the tone they saw it as setting for the new era in Washington. “Dad is home,” Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist and media figure, wrote on X.</p><p>Others who have studied Mr. Trump over the years say he has been doing a version of this pose for a long time, and that the intense look has evolved from the days of “The Apprentice” to his mug shot and then his raised fist after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. “If Donald Trump’s old Clint Eastwood ‘High Plains Drifter’ squint got married to the Georgia mug shot photo, they would have produced this inauguration photo,” said Timothy O’Brien, a Trump biographer. “And the fact that Trump signed off on it means he loved it.”</p><p>In the past, Mr. Trump has told photographers who have taken his portrait that he would like to appear Churchillian. (On the first day of Mr. Trump’s first term as president, he restored a bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This new portrait — which was taken a few weeks ago by Daniel Torok, Mr. Trump’s chief photographer — was intended specifically for Monday’s inauguration. Soon, a different photo will be selected as Mr. Trump’s official presidential portrait; that image will be distributed to government agencies and to American embassies around the world.</p><p>Those official portraits often offer a glimpse of both an individual president’s persona and the mood of the nation.</p><p>Pete Souza, who was the White House chief photographer under Barack Obama, said the 44th president didn’t want to smile much in his official portrait. “We were in the middle of a recession,” said Mr. Souza. “I think that probably affected the way we did that first photo where Obama had not a full smile, kind of just, like, a hint of a smile.”</p><p>Last time, Mr. Trump did smile. His official portrait taken for his first presidency showed him beaming beatifically. It was a hastily arranged photo taken after many months of delay. According to Ms. Craighead, who took it, he never seemed to like it all that much. “The photo that you see today is probably the one he would have loved to have back then,” she said.</p><p>A scowl is “his favorite pose,” she added. “He doesn’t want to smile because it seems weak, is probably what he would say.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s first official presidential portrait, taken in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shealah Craighead</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shawn McCreesh is a Times reporter covering the 2024 presidential election.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shawn-mccreesh">More about Shawn McCreesh</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Buying Greenland: </strong>Ken Howery, a close friend of Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s pick for ambassador to Denmark, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/elon-musk-donald-trump-greenland.html">expected to be central</a> to what the president-elect hopes will be a real-estate deal of epic proportions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Conflicts: </strong>Trump’s pick for interior secretary, Doug Burgum, said he would sell some holdings if confirmed, but he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/doug-burgum-interior-department.html">held onto his investments as North Dakota’s governor</a>.
