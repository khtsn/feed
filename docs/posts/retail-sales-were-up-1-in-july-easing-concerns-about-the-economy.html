    <h1>Retail Sales Were Up 1% in July, Easing Concerns About the Economy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retail sales in July came in above expectations, the government reported on Thursday, painting an optimistic picture of consumer spending that could ease concerns about the strength of the economy.</p><p>The better-than-expected results, pointing to continued economic sturdiness, drove stocks higher. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 1 percent in early trading, as did the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite.</p><p><a href="https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Retail sales rose 1 percent in July</a> from the previous month, the Commerce Department said, well above the 0.4 percent increase that economists were expecting. A bounce-back in auto sales as cyberattack-related disruptions faded probably intensified the jump in overall retail sales, analysts said. But sales excluding autos and gasoline, a calculation that can be more indicative of spending trends, also beat expectations, rising 0.4 percent.</p><p>Consumer spending is a key driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product. The strong retail sales report, which is not adjusted for inflation, pointed to resilience in consumer spending and provided reassurance after recession fears, tied to weaker-than-expected employment numbers, catalyzed a market sell-off early this month. Itâ€™s the latest in a string of data points this week that allay those worries.</p></div></div>
