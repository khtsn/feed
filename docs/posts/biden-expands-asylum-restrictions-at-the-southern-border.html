    <h1>Biden Expands Asylum Restrictions at the Southern Border</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Biden on Monday expanded the temporary restrictions on asylum that he imposed over the summer, ensuring that the crackdown at the southern border will stay in effect for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The executive action, which goes into effect on Tuesday, builds on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/us/politics/biden-executive-order-border-asylum.html" title="">the restrictions that Mr. Biden announced in June</a>, which blocked a vast majority of asylum claims at the U.S.-Mexico border and allowed agents to turn people back quickly.</p><p>Biden administration officials have credited the policy for leading to the dramatic reduction in illegal crossings at a critical moment in the presidential campaign, as Vice President Kamala Harris has faced sharp criticism over the border.</p><p>Under the June order, the restrictions on asylum would lift when the number of people trying to cross illegally each day dropped below 1,500 for one week, which has not happened so far. The latest action requires that the numbers stay down for 28 days straight.</p></div></div>
