The latest action requires that the numbers stay down for 28 days straight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Government officials maintain that the change is necessary because extreme weather conditions or other temporary developments could artificially lower the numbers without changing the overall migration dynamic in Mexico.</p><p>This change, they contend, ensures that the order will lift only when the migratory patterns have changed significantly.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union has sued over the order, saying it violates immigration law. Immigrant advocates have said the order is putting would-be asylum seekers in danger by not permitting them the ordinary access of the asylum system.</p><p>“The asylum statute enacted by Congress recognizes that people fleeing danger should not be forced to wait and try to secure an appointment to seek asylum,” Omar Jadwat, the head of the A.C.L.U.’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement on Monday. “The government’s abandonment of that principle is already having grave consequences for the people our laws are intended to protect.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
