In recent elections, Democrats have had an edge in the popular vote even when they have lost the Electoral College and thus the White House. They have been looking to Ms. Harris to build a strong national lead as a sign that she would do well in such critical swing states as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p><p><em>[</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/upshot/poll-trump-harris-election.html" title=""><em>Nate Cohn evaluates</em></a><em> whether Donald Trump could win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College.]</em></p><p>Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump remain effectively tied even after three of the most tumultuous months in recent American political history. A high-profile debate, two attempts on Mr. Trump’s life, dozens of rallies across seven battlefield states and hundreds of millions spent on advertisements have seemingly done little to change the trajectory of the race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Harris’s position, if anything, may have declined among likely voters since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/harris-trump-poll-national.html" title="">the last Times/Siena College poll</a>, taken in early October. At the time, she had a slight lead over Mr. Trump, 49 percent to 46 percent. The change is within the margin of error, but The Times’s national polling average has registered a tightening in polls over the past few weeks as well, suggesting at the very least that this contest has drawn even closer.</p><p><em>[Follow </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title=""><em>the latest polls</em></a><em> and see updated </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title=""><em>polling averages of the Harris vs. Trump matchup</em></a><em>.]</em></p><p>While this latest Times/Siena College poll offers a glimpse into national sentiment, the presidential election will be decided in the seven battleground states where Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump have devoted the overwhelming amount of their time and resources.

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There are glimmers of hope in this final national poll for both Mr. Trump and Ms. Harris. For Mr. Trump it is immigration: 15 percent of respondents named immigration as their top issue, up from 12 percent.</p><p>Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/trump-says-hell-undertake-the-largest-deportation-in-us-history-can-he-do-that/ar-AA1sQdGI?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hammered Ms. Harris</a> on the Biden administration’s record on the issue — he has pledged to undertake “the largest deportation in American history” — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/trump-immigration-closing-message.html" title="">as a closing message</a> in his campaign speeches and advertisements. Voters by an 11-point margin said they trusted Mr. Trump more than Ms. Harris to deal with immigration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I’m sorry, I do not agree with the illegals and the refugees coming in the country,” said Sandra Remiker, 51, a Republican from Barron, Wis., who said she was planning to vote for Mr. Trump. She added: “I mean, if we can’t help our own people, our own veterans that are living on the streets, we shouldn’t be helping other countries.”</p><p>And voters continue to be pessimistic about the direction of the country, a measure that historically has been a danger sign for the party in power. Just 28 percent of respondents said the country was heading in the right direction. Mr. Trump has repeatedly painted a dark picture of the nation under President Biden and Ms. Harris.</p><p>The percentage of Americans who said that Mr. Trump, who is 78, is too old to be president remained at 41 percent, essentially unchanged from July even after a series of rambling campaign speeches and appearances led to a swell of questions, including direct criticism from Ms. Harris, about the former president’s mental acuity and fitness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The poll included some encouraging signs for Ms. Harris as well. She has narrowed the gap with Mr. Trump on the economy, which remains the top issue for voters. Mr. Trump had a 13-point edge over Ms. Harris on which candidate could better manage the economy in the poll last month. That has shrunk to 6 percentage points.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“She does have a little bit more experience in the government at least,” said Luis Mata, an independent in San Antonio who said he changed his mind and decided to support Ms. Harris after watching her debate with Mr. Trump. “I know Donald Trump was our president for one term, but, before that, I don’t think he really had too much experience aside from being a businessman.”</p><p>Ms. Harris also has a 16-point lead over Mr. Trump on which candidate would do a better job in protecting abortion access, a central theme of her campaign, as she seeks to build up support among female voters.</p><p>And Ms. Harris still has room to grow. About 15 percent of voters described themselves as not fully decided, and Ms. Harris is leading with that group, 42 percent to 32 percent. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump had a minute edge with undecided or persuadable voters, 36 percent to 35 percent.</p><p>“Both are not great candidates and I’m on the fence if I’m going to vote at all — I don’t like either of them,” said Christopher Morgan, 33, an independent from Atlanta. But, he added: “If I had to, I’d probably vote for Kamala Harris. I don’t like Trump because I feel like he violated democracy. He should be accountable for what happened on Jan. 6.”</p><p>The poll found that the 9 percent of Americans who said they already had voted leaned heavily toward Ms. Harris, 59 percent to 40 percent. That is consistent with the advantage Democrats have historically had in early voting and mail voting, though there are signs this year that Republicans, unlike in 2020, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/trump-republicans-early-voting.html" title="">are casting early ballots</a> in unusually heavy numbers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>This latest poll, as most of the polls done by Times/Siena over the past three months, is evidence of an electorate that is both polarized and frozen. There has been little change on some of the key questions used to measure voter sentiment.</p><p>Ms. Harris was viewed favorably by 46 percent of the electorate after Mr. Biden dropped out; she is seen favorably by 48 percent in this latest poll. Mr. Trump was viewed favorably by 47 percent of respondents when Mr. Biden dropped out; he is now viewed favorably by 48 percent of respondents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-13"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="nationalpoll-traits" data-id="100000009781415" data-source-id="100000009781415"><div data-sourceid="100000009781415" id="embed-id-100000009781415">

There was essentially no change in those numbers over the course of this short contest.</p><p>Larrissa Alexander, 27, a Republican in Atlanta, said she voted for Mr. Biden in 2020, but decided to oppose Ms. Harris this time because of the way Ms. Harris handled immigration as Mr. Biden’s vice president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I was very, extremely disappointed in her response to our immigration issue,” she said. “And when she was first elected, that was one of the things that she was tasked with handling.

Overall, 98 percent of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for this poll.

The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For these polls, interviewers placed more than 260,000 calls to more than 80,000 voters.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree.
