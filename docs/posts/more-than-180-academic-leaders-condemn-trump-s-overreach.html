    <h1>More Than 180 Academic Leaders Condemn Trump’s ‘Overreach’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A day after Harvard sued the Trump administration over its decision to freeze billions in federal funds to the school, more than 180 higher education leaders from around the country released a joint <a href="https://www.aacu.org/newsroom/a-call-for-constructive-engagement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Tuesday condemning the administration’s efforts to control universities.</p><p>The government’s “political interference” and “overreach” is “now endangering higher education in America,” they wrote.</p><p>The signers come from a variety of colleges and universities from across the country, as well as higher education associations, illustrating the breadth of the threat they say President Trump poses to academia. Joining in the statement were officials from large public research universities like the University of Virginia and the University of Wisconsin-Madison and smaller private colleges such as Amherst and Kenyon.</p><p>The statement, circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities and signed by a total of 187 people as of Tuesday morning, focuses on concerns that the Trump administration is attacking academic freedom.</p></div></div>
