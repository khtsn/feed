His wife, Donna, died in 2023.</p><p>For all his fortitude, Schallock did not set a record for longevity in professional baseball. The pitcher Si Simmons of the Lincoln Giants of the Negro leagues lived to 111, and the Yankee pitcher Red Hoff reached 107.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
