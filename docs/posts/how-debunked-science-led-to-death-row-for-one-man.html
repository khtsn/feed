    <h1>How Debunked Science Led to Death Row for One Man</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The number of states that have rejected capital punishment has increased steadily since the late 1990s. Twenty-nine states have now either abolished the death penalty or have paused executions by executive action, up from 12 states in 1999.</p><p>Last year, for the first time, a Gallup poll found that more Americans believe the death penalty is administered unfairly than fairly (50 percent versus 47 percent). And the percentage of people who support the death penalty has fallen steadily since the mid-1990s, according to Gallup, dropping to 53 percent this year, a five-decade low.</p><p>But other recent data urgently underscores how much hard work remains for abolitionists. The downward trend in the number of executions that prevailed for two decades — there were 11 in 2021, way down from the peak of 98 in 1999 — has recently reversed. There were 18 executions in 2022 and another 24 last year, a worrisome uptick driven in part by governors and prosecutors seeking to burnish their crime-fighting bona fides.</p><p>And there are still about 2,400 prisoners sitting on death row around the United States, awaiting execution.</p><p>Among them is Charles Don Flores, who was found guilty of killing a woman in Farmers Branch, Texas, in a drug-related home invasion.</p></div></div>
