</span> into the remaining spots.</p>



<p>The first match of the day was guaranteed to lock in a Champions representative. If EDG won, they would secure their spot, but if TYLOO won, XLG would qualify instead. In the end, EDG won in 2-0 fashion, punching their tickets to Paris to defend their Champions title and continuing to not drop a single map to TYLOO in their history as a team.</p>

<p>The match kicked off on TYLOO&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527585/tyloo-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2025-china-stage-2-lr2/?game=230581&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>. After previously playing a Viper composition against JDG Esports, EDG opted to change to a double-Duelist composition. The biggest surprise, however, was that <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> picked Yoru for the first time since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2359/vct-2025-china-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>, while <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span> was the one on Neon.</p>

<p>The map started scrappy, with both teams winning back-to-back ecos in rounds 2 and 3. EDG stabilized from there, winning eight rounds in a row to lead 9-3 at the half. <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/39485/scales">
		Scales	</a>
</span> put up an impressive individual performance on Iso with 17 kills at the half, but TYLOO was ultimately unable to close out rounds against the clutch power of EDG. </p>

<p>A pistol win for EDG in the second half allowed them to quickly close out the map 13-3. Both of the team&#39;s duelists topped the scoreboard, ZmjjKK ending with 20 kills, 203 ADR, and a 1.88 rating, and Jieni7 following suit with 21 kills, 204 ADR, and a 1.52 rating.</p>

<p>The second map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527585/tyloo-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2025-china-stage-2-lr2/?game=230582&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Ascent</a>, where both teams utilized standard Sova-KAY/O compositions. TYLOO started their defense strong with a pistol win and bonus conversion, but EDG flipped the momentum with a round 4 eco win to take a 5-3 lead. The half ended 7-5 in favor of EDG off the back of coordinated site hits and solid fragging from ZmjjKK and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span>.</p>

<p>Faced with the threat of their season ending, TYLOO held on, converting a second pistol and bonus but dropping yet another eco for an 8-8 deadlock. A 1v3 ace from <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/41739/slowly">
		slowly	</a>
</span> in round 18 drew things at 9-9, but EDG ultimately proved superior in the buy rounds and won Ascent 13-11.</p>

<p><em>slowly keeps TYLOO in the game with a monstrous 1v3 ace.</em></p>

<p>Champions now out of their grasp, TYLOO ends their season in the top six after a major turnaround from Stage 1 to Stage 2, while EDG forges onward in the lower bracket in hopes for a better seed.</p>



<p>With EDG having won their match, XLG&#39;s 2-1 defeat over AG locked in both XLG and DRG for the final two Champions slots for China. Both Ascension teams qualifying to Champions means that whichever team performs better in Paris will guarantee their spot in VCT 2026, while the other team will still have to defend their spot in Ascension later this year. </p>

<p>The series began on XLG&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527586/xi-lai-gaming-vs-all-gamers-vct-2025-china-stage-2-lr2/?game=230584&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Ascent</a>, pitting their Chamber-Vyse composition against AG&#39;s Deadlock-Cypher. AG won the pistol, but XLG won the eco and started a snowball with their ultimates to turn a 2-2 score into a comfortable 9-3 on their attack side. </p>

<p>AG managed to close the gap considerably in the second half despite dropping the second pistol, turning XLG&#39;s 11-3 lead into a closer 12-8, but the gap caught up to them and XLG took Ascent 13-8. <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36415/viva">
		Viva	</a>
</span> was the standout for his team from start to finish, putting up 24 kills to 10 deaths, 203 ADR, and a 1.78 rating on Sova.</p>

<p>Next up was AG&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527586/xi-lai-gaming-vs-all-gamers-vct-2025-china-stage-2-lr2/?game=230585&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Icebox</a>. While AG struggled with their defense on Ascent, they thrived on Icebox, clearly reading XLG&#39;s movements around the map and shutting them down at almost every turn with sound retakes and plant denial tactics. XLG scraped a couple rounds with A hits, but the half eventually ended 9-3 in favor of AG. </p>

<p>Much like the first map, XLG began closing the gap in the second half, getting the score as close as 11-9, but AG successfully capitalized on their lead to win Icebox 13-9. <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/46748/k1ra">
		K1ra	</a>
</span> ruled the server on Viper with a 26/14/3 KDA and 204 ADR.</p>

<p>The decider came down to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527586/xi-lai-gaming-vs-all-gamers-vct-2025-china-stage-2-lr2/?game=230586&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>, where XLG once again brought out the triple-Sentinel composition that they lost 12-14 to DRG with just <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/527579/xi-lai-gaming-vs-dragon-ranger-gaming-vct-2025-china-stage-2-ubsf/?game=230561&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">yesterday</a>. This time, with Champions on the line, they utterly outclassed AG, steamrolling to an 11-1 attack half that AG could find no response to and closing it out 13-1. <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/22047/rarga">
		Rarga	</a>
</span> put up an unbelievable 23 kills to only four deaths on Sage, while <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/37927/happywei">

</span> trailed with 16 kills to six deaths on Cypher. </p>
