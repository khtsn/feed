Her political roots are in the nationalist right; his are in the globalist, technocratic center. They have regularly tilted at each other, and people in Ms. Meloni’s entourage concede the two leaders do not share great chemistry.</p><p>Yet on Tuesday Ms. Meloni and Mr. Macron are set to hold a bilateral meeting in Rome, the French leader’s first official trip to Italy specifically to meet the Italian prime minister since she took office in 2022.</p><p>Coming on the heels of public sniping between them last month, the visit highlights the acute pressure European leaders are under to seek to come together in pursuit of their shared goals. Despite their differences, both Mr. Macron and Ms. Meloni want to end a shooting war in Ukraine, avert a trade war with the United States and steady relations with a mercurial President Trump.</p><p>“At some point, the international situation made this dysfunction unworkable,” said Jean-Pierre Darnis, a professor of Italian politics and contemporary history at the Université Côte d’Azur in Nice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still it remains to be seen whether a tête-à-tête and a dinner on Tuesday can take the chill out of relations between two leaders who, <a href="https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2025/06/02/news/macron-e-meloni-non-si-sopportano-ma-non-sono-poi-cosi-lontani-7786241/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Claudio Cerasa</a>, the editor of Italy’s newspaper Il Foglio, wrote this week “are made to misunderstand each other.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/25/world/europe/italy-meloni-prime-minister.html" title="">Ms. Meloni</a> forged her political identity as an outsider, vigorously opposing the kind of liberal internationalism and perceived elitism embodied by Mr. Macron, who attended the right schools and worked as an investment banker. She grew up in a working-class neighborhood and came to lead a nationalist, anti-immigrant party with roots in Italy’s fascist past.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Meloni campaigning in Naples in 2022 for her hard-right Brothers of Italy party.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Macron has spent much of his political career battling Marine Le Pen, France’s top far-right nationalist figure, who was his leading opponent in the last two presidential elections. He sees in Ms. Meloni “a powdered copy of Marine Le Pen and sees in her legitimization the risk of legitimizing Le Pen,” Mr. Cerasa said.</p><p>On top of that, for nationalist Italians like many of Ms. Meloni’s supporters, France is often seen as an overweening historical rival that has meddled in Italian politics, said Mr. Darnis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Put those two things together, it more or less explains why they didn’t really want to have a nice photo together,” Mr. Darnis said.</p><p>The two leaders have profoundly different visions for Europe, too.</p><p>Even as Ms. Meloni has tempered her most inflammatory anti European Union rhetoric, she still criticizes what she calls overreach by the E.U. Mr. Macron, on the other hand, has made an unwavering commitment to a stronger, more integrated Europe a core part of his political identity.</p><p>Mr. Macron has long called for European <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/macron-europe.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes" title="">“strategic autonomy,”</a> with reduced reliance on American power, and France <a href="https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spends more</a> than Italy on its military.</p><p>He and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain have suggested deploying European troops to Ukraine as a peacekeeping force after a cease-fire. Ms. Meloni opposes that idea, which would be deeply unpopular in Italy, where anti-military sentiment has long run deep.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Macron, with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain at a meeting of European leaders in Kyiv last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Genya Savilov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>She also faces the challenge of balancing her own stance with that of her Deputy Prime Minister and coalition partner, Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League Party, who has consistently leveraged Italy’s antiwar sentiment and spoken forcefully against European rearmament efforts.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Meloni did not join the so-called “coalition of the willing,” a group of European nations mustered by Britain and France to back Ukraine. Last month, when European leaders huddled around a speakerphone in a conference room in Tirana, Albania, to discuss peace in Ukraine with President Trump, Ms. Meloni was absent. </p><p>She explained that the group had the goal of deploying European troops to Ukraine, and she was not available to do that.</p><p>Mr. Macron rebutted her claim as “fake news.”</p><p>Shortly after, Ms. Meloni, in a veiled barb at the French president, said at a news conference that it was necessary “to set aside personal ambitions that risk undermining the unity of the West.”</p><p>Italian and French officials insist that the countries’ ministers and diplomats work well together and Ms. Meloni said that news reports about a crisis between Italy and France were overblown.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Even so, government officials and independent observers have called the bickering between Rome and Paris an annoyance, even embarrassing.</p><p>“We can’t do this soap opera anymore,” <a href="https://www.editorialedomani.it/idee/commenti/macron-vs-meloni-della-telenovela-tra-italia-e-francia-non-se-ne-puo-piu-hccsrf6x?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=domanigiornale" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read a headline on Italian newspaper Domani</a> last week as it pleaded with leaders to “get over” the Italian-French rivalry.</p><p>The meeting on Tuesday, experts say, will in part serve as a public show of unity.</p><p>“It’s symbolic,” said Marc Lazar, a professor of Italian-French relations at Rome’s Luiss Guido Carli university. “It’s a move to say ‘the two are talking.’”</p><p>“There is an infinite amount of issues to talk about,” Ms. Meloni told reporters on Friday. “I am very happy that Emmanuel Macron is coming to Rome.”</p><p>Catherine Porter<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Falsehoods in Bill: </strong>President Trump has sought to assuage some lawmakers’ concerns over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/trump-big-beautiful-bill-facts.html">domestic policy bill’s price tag and cuts to Medicaid with inaccurate claims.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Butterworth&#39;s MAGA Scene</strong>: For Trump’s political movement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/magazine/butterworths-restaurant-washington-trump-maga.html">Butterworth’s, the see-and-be-seen Capitol Hill restaurant,</a> represents an ostentatious new evolutionary phase: the deplorable as arriviste.</p></li><li><p><strong>Murkowski Pushes Back:</strong> At a time when the Republican Congress has grown increasingly deferential to Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/murkowski-life-under-trump.html">Senator Lisa Murkowski has veered in the opposite direction from her party,</a> using sharp words and her vote on the Senate floor to make a stand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fear at the F.B.I.:</strong> Agents have been forced out.
