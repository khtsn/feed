Grateful to be able to rise right now and speak. I just want to tell you what John Lewis said. It’s a quote so many people know. He said, ‘get in good trouble, necessary trouble.’ So tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble. I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able. In just 71 days, the President of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for — from our highest offices, a sense of common decency. These are not normal times in America. And they should not be treated as such. John Lewis, so many heroes before us, would say that this is the time to stand up, to speak up. This is the time to get in some good trouble, to get into necessary trouble.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/multimedia/01trump-news-booker-speech-tbkc/01trump-news-booker-speech-tbkc-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Senator Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, spoke for hours, criticizing the Trump administration’s policies on Social Security, education, health care and more.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-04-01T16:42:24-04:00"><span>April 1, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>4:42 p.m. ET</span></span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Senator Cory Booker, visibly tired but still upright at a lectern on the Senate floor, was continuing a marathon speech criticizing the Trump administration on Tuesday, a show of physical and oratorical stamina that he hoped would put a spotlight on what he called a “crisis” facing the United States under President Trump.</p><p>Mr. Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, began speaking at 7 p.m. on Monday and was still going 21 hours later, laying into the Trump administration’s cuts to government services and its crackdown on immigrants.</p><p>“This is not right or left, it is right or wrong,” Mr. Booker said on Tuesday afternoon, his voice still strong. “This is not a partisan moment, it is a moral moment. Where do you stand?”</p><p>The speech was part of an effort by Democrats to retake the initiative and more assertively oppose President Trump. Mr. Booker divided his remarks into sections focused on an aspect of the administration’s policies, including on health care, education, immigration and national security.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Booker appeared to be pressing to break a record set by Senator Strom Thurmond, who in 1957 delivered a 24-hour-18-minute filibuster opposing a piece of civil rights legislation. Mr. Booker, who for weeks had contemplated giving a marathon floor speech, has long been bothered that Mr. Thurmond, a segregationist from South Carolina, held the record, according to Mr. Booker’s office. (The Senate’s <a href="https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/four_column_table/All_Night_Sessions.shtml#:~:text=During%20this%20session%2C%20Senator%20Wayne,MT)%20spoke%20for%20four%20hours" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">log of longest speeches</a> does not reach back to the founding of the nation, but Mr. Thurmond’s is the longest on record.)</p><p>Mr. Booker’s speech was not a filibuster — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/us/politics/filibuster-senate-manchin-sinema.html" title="">a procedural tactic</a> that has been used to block legislation on many issues — because it did not come during a debate over a specific bill or nominee. But it did delay a planned vote on a Democratic-led bill to undo Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada.</p><p>“I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,” Mr. Booker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXdqHXbp04s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said near the start of his speech</a> on Monday. “I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our nation is in crisis.”</p><p>He assailed what he said were Mr. Trump’s plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/upshot/trump-medicaid-tax-cuts.html" title="">cut funding for Medicaid</a>, among other programs. The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/fact-check-president-trump-will-always-protect-social-security-medicare/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> that it plans to cut Medicaid benefits, but the president and his allies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/business/trump-debt-tax-us.html" title="">attacked Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security</a> over what they claim is waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>Going without bathroom breaks but taking occasional pauses for encouraging questions from his fellow Democrats, Mr. Booker read from a binder of notes and waved a small copy of the U.S. Constitution. Over the hours, his voice grew hoarse. But it continued to boom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“My voice is adequate,” Mr. Booker said. “My efforts today are inadequate to stop what they’re trying to do. But we the people are powerful.”</p><p>Before his speech, Mr. Booker <a href="https://x.com/CoryBooker/status/1906844166467764732" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that he was heading to the Senate floor because Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire who is one of the president’s top advisers, had shown what he called “a complete disregard for the rule of law, the Constitution and the needs of the American people.”</p><p>Mr. Musk’s feed on X, his social media platform, was active Tuesday, but it made no mention of Mr. Booker or his all-night speech. Neither did Mr. Trump’s Truth Social feed.</p><p>As thousands of viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2utlMxAwtE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">followed</a> on Mr. Booker’s official YouTube channel, he quoted from celebrated speeches by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html" title="">Representative John Lewis</a> and Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/obituaries/john-mccain-dead.html" title="">John McCain</a>, both of whom have died. At one point, he spent around 30 minutes reading an account by a Canadian citizen, Jasmine Mooney, about her detention in the United States by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/mooney-canadian-american-pie-actress-ice.html" title="">immigration enforcement</a> officers.</p><p>Since 1915, many of the 48 all-night sessions in the chamber — defined as those lasting past 4 a.m. — have <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/AllNightSessions.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gone well over 24 hours</a>. Senator Ted Cruz’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/us/politics/senate-budget-battle.html" title="">verbal assault</a> on President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in 2013 lasted 21 hours and 19 minutes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Booker would pass Mr. Cruz at 4:20 p.m. on Tuesday, and surpass Mr. Thurmond’s Senate record about three hours after that.</p><p>Maya C.
