                        <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11737/eyeballers" data-tooltip-id="uid27814997">EYEBALLERS</a> coach <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/434/pita" data-tooltip-id="uid41278073">Faruk <span>&#34;⁠pita⁠&#34;</span> Pita</a> stopped by HLTV&#39;s microphone after the 2-1 loss to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12916/betclic" data-tooltip-id="uid363096185">Betclic</a>, which sent his team out of the tournament.</p>
                        <p>He lamented that the team let a 9-3 lead slip on Inferno against <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13404/gentle-mates" data-tooltip-id="uid797822861">Gentle Mates</a> due to miscommunication.</p>
                        <p>&#34;Small miscoms, small decisions not going our way,&#34; he said, adding that he thinks <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11737/eyeballers" data-tooltip-id="uid27814997">EYEBALLERS</a>&#39; Major hopes are dead and buried after this match.</p>
                        <p><strong>On being eliminated from the event on day 1:</strong> &#34;I think everyone is very upset, obviously. We had higher hopes, even though, coming into this tournament I think we had a bit of a rocky period. I think we had a pretty decent autumn and winter. We started off the year very well versus FaZe Clan and did pretty okay versus number one in the world. And since then, we&#39;ve had some... I would say we&#39;re in some slump. But when we came into this tournament, I think we were hoping for some redemption.</p>
                        <p>We started off the day not very well but decently by beating Betclic, and then obviously winning the first map against Gentle Mates and being up 9-3 in the second map. And looking at us right now, we have to leave already after the first day…&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On whether the team got complacent on Inferno against Gentle Mates:</strong> &#34;I think there were some miscoms, I would say, on the T side of Inferno. I think the start was... I think they were up 4-0 and our first weapon round was just miscommunication. I think we maybe let it slip a little bit, even though we know Gentle Mates is a really good team on Inferno, especially their CT side is really, really good. Not that easy to play against.</p>
                        <p>But we had a lot of situations, I would say, on T side Inferno that I think we should have won. A 3v3 on B site afterplant. We also had some rounds where we got into the site and we should just be able to clean that up pretty easy. But small miscoms, small decisions not going our way. So yeah, that sucks. And the third map, Ancient, was super close.</p>
                        <p><strong>On the impact of this loss on their Major hopes:</strong> &#34;We&#39;ll see. I don&#39;t know if the Major is still a possibility for us. If it is, obviously we&#39;ll just try to go all in. But I think after this loss, we can maybe count out the Major and try to maybe decide what we&#39;re going to play based on the long term.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On the main lessons from this event:</strong> &#34;We need to keep on developing our playbook, I would say. We have a pretty loose style that fits these players very well. But as every time when the loose play style is not working, it&#39;s usually because we&#39;re not shooting our opponents the way we should. And obviously that makes it difficult. I would have to review the demo to exactly see what we have to keep on working.</p>
                        <p>A bad day, obviously. I think Betclic played really well. Obviously, Gentle Mates also played super well. So two really tough opponents. We could have been at the restaurant half-celebrating that we made it through as number one in the group. A quick U-turn. It can change so fast in this game. So it is what it is. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.&#34;</p>
