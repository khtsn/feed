                        <p><strong>On the 2-0 win after Overpass comeback:</strong> &#34;I lost my voice, to be honest. It was a very tough game. Right now, Monte is in good shape. I&#39;m very happy that we managed to make this comeback. It&#39;s showing that we have something inside. We have the fire. It&#39;s good. I think it&#39;s our first comeback with this lineup, without blameF. I&#39;m very proud of my team.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On picking up their fourth straight win against Monte:</strong> &#34;It&#39;s not an easy match-up for us, but I feel we understand how to play against them, call-wise, how they move, etc. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a comfortable opponent for us.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On finding a way without blameF:</strong> &#34;We&#39;re still trying to find the right way. After Benjamin left, it&#39;s a completely different game. We&#39;re still trying to find the key, how to involve everyone to the maximum.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On facing HOTU in the semis:</strong> &#34;To be honest, I think I have never faced them with this lineup. So I need to watch them. I have not followed their games. I will prepare heavily.&#34;</p>

                        <p><strong>On what went wrong in the series:</strong> &#34;I&#39;m not quite sure, to be honest. From a spectator POV, we just got wrecked in everything we tried. We tried fast things. We tried slow things, and they were just smacking us. They were definitely better than us, to be honest. A class above us. We just got smacked. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On the main takeaways from this event:</strong> &#34;It&#39;s hard to say right now. It&#39;s hard to say that the tournament was positive after such a beating. But still, our plan was to get out of the hard group that we had. We were facing good opponents and we got out of the group. We got two wins, VRS is on plus, so it was definitely a good tournament from that perspective.</p>
                        <p>We wish we played better in this match, but it is what it is. It&#39;s progress. We set our goal for those tournaments when the roster was created, because we&#39;ve only been playing together for a month and a half, that we want to be competitive in those tournaments. And we were competitive in the groups. In this match, we weren&#39;t competitive at all. They were just a class above us.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On the goals for the next events:</strong> &#34;We just want to continue to improve and get experience. We have a 17-year-old guy, and a guy who played two officials before coming to us. It&#39;s constant progress. We just want to climb the ranking and play better. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>

                        <p><strong>On the main takeaways from the event:</strong> &#34;I think it was good. We managed to be competitive, which was the most important thing at this stage, in which we are still building quite a lot and learning every day, especially after the creation of the project from scratch, which is always hard. It was also important for us to see how we could improve in the maps that we played.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On being smashed on their pick of D2:</strong> &#34;One of our best maps is Inferno, and it&#39;s a map that they ban, so it&#39;s difficult right from the outset. Nuke has been going well for us, even though we lost it twice to NIP. We did better on it today, even though our T side was a bit shaky. We felt we could have closed a lot of the rounds. On D2, they were simply better, they were prepared for anything. We felt we couldn&#39;t do much mid-game; they had better reads and the right setups every time.&#34;</p>
                        <p><strong>On the team&#39;s goals for DraculaN:</strong> &#34;Perhaps expectations will be a bit higher, and we will want to make a deeper run. I don&#39;t think the event will have the same caliber of teams as this one, which had many top 20 and top 30 teams. We want to perform well and be competitive again.&#34;</p>
