It’s not just the war in Ukraine, she said, but also the apparent sabotage this week of fiber-optic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/business/finland-germany-cable-baltic-sea.html" title="">cables in the Baltic Sea</a>, the conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine.html" title="">growing relationship</a> with North Korea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The new version of Sweden’s preparedness booklet: “In Case of Crisis or War.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Nordics have long been wary of their belligerent neighbor to the East.</p><p>Finland, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/world/europe/finland-nato-russia-ukraine.html" title="">joined NATO in 2023</a>, shares an 830-mile border with Russia. Norway, which has helped Europe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/business/energy-environment/ukraine-russia-war-europe-energy.html" title="">heat its homes</a> after Russia cut gas exports, is worried about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/world/europe/arctic-norway-russian-spies.html" title="">Russian spies</a> near their shared border. And Sweden, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/world/europe/sweden-nato-neutrality.html" title="">which joined NATO in March</a>, warned that “military threat levels are increasing” in its recent pamphlet release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The Swedish government is taking the security situation really seriously,” Mr. Werger said. “The general perspective is that you cannot exclude the possibility of an armed attack.”</p><p>On Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin officially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/europe/putin-russia-nuclear-weapons-missiles.html" title="">lowered Russia’s threshold</a> for using nuclear weapons. In addition, a day after the Biden administration had authorized it, Ukraine fired U.S.-made ballistic missiles into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia-atacms-missiles.html" title="">Russia for the first time</a>, officials said.</p><p>“The war in Ukraine affects Ukraine, but it also affects our safety and security,” Espen Barth Eide, Norway’s foreign minister, <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/1-000-days-of-full-scale-war-in-ukraine/id3075201/?utm_source=regjeringen.no&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=nyhetsvarsel20241119" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Tuesday.</p><p>Norway updated its advice because “the world has changed significantly since 2018,” Tore Kamfjord, a head of the country’s civil preparedness campaign, said in an email.</p><p>One change he noted: Norwegians should be ready to sustain themselves for a week, up from three days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We face a lasting deterioration in the security situation in our region,” Mr. Kamfjord said, also pointing to the worsening effects of climate change and broader digital security threats.</p><p>For Sweden, the pamphlet, “In Case of Crisis or War,” is the latest step in a broad push to ready the country for war. At 32 pages, it is almost twice as long as the 2018 edition, which was its first significant revision since the Cold War and followed Russia’s annexation of Crimea.</p><p>There are more details on things like how to seek shelter and how to evacuate, Mr. Werger said. There’s also a new section for people who need special assistance or have pets, he added.</p><p>Next month, the Swedish parliament is set to vote on <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/5c98b885c2cc40d58aa3693d34d915d3/totalforsvaret-20252030-prop.-20242534.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a defense bill</a> that would boost military and civil defense spending over the next five years.</p><p>“If Sweden is attacked, we will never surrender,” the pamphlet says. “Any suggestion to the contrary is false.”</p><p>That statement is now on the first page after the table of contents. In 2018, a version was on page 12, buried below tips on identifying fake information and checklists for home preparation.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amelia Nierenberg is a breaking news reporter for The Times in London, covering international news<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amelia-nierenberg">More about Amelia Nierenberg</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Nordic Countries, Eyeing Russia, Update Crisis Guides<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/north-atlantic-treaty-organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Biden’s Last-Ditch Pitch:</strong> President Biden began what is likely to be his last summit with global leaders, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/biden-g20-trump.html">pushing for even stronger support of Ukraine</a> despite the uncertainty of how President-elect Donald Trump might undo his efforts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Severing of Baltic Sea Cables</strong><strong>:</strong> Germany’s defense minister called the severing of two fiber-optic cables in the Baltic Sea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/business/finland-germany-cable-baltic-sea.html">an act of sabotage</a> aimed at European countries that are supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia.</p></li><li><p><strong>Putin Talks With Scholz:</strong> German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Vladimir Putin of Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/europe/scholz-putin-russia-germany-call.html">spoke by phone for an hour</a>, the first discussion between Putin and a sitting leader of a large Western country since late 2022.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
