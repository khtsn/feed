Trump’s campaign, which began working with groups funded by billionaires like Elon Musk on a canvassing operation targeting swing state voters in the final days of the campaign.</p><p>“We’ll know soon whether it was genius or lunacy to put all this in Elon Musk’s hands, but it’s bad that you can do it at all,” said Tom Moore, who until last year served as chief of staff for a Democratic member of the F.E.C. who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/aos/2024-01/202401V_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposed</a> the request. “Opening the money faucets up as wide as they go strikes me as a bad idea for Democrats, because Republicans just have a bigger faucet.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In his three-decade career, Mr. Elias has arguably done more than any single person outside government to shape the Democratic Party and the rules under which all campaigns and elections in the United States are conducted. He and his firm have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/us/elections/democrats-election-legal-challenges.html" title="">retained by Vice President Harris’s campaign</a> to assist with recounts and anticipated legal fights after the election.</p><p>His efforts have earned him an enthusiastic fan base among Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans, who see him as a heroic bulwark against democratic backsliding, and have celebrated his wins, including two significant Supreme Court rulings last year.</p><p>But Mr. Elias’s tactics are not admired by everyone. Critics on the right say he has packaged his bare-knuckle partisanship as a high-minded pursuit of democratic values. Detractors on the left fault him for empowering the ultrarich to exercise disproportionate political influence, and for pushing aggressive initiatives that have backfired at times, playing into the hands of the Republicans he strives to thwart.</p><p>And while the reasons remain murky, a prominent long-term client, the Democratic National Committee, <a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/41223-punchbowl-news-am/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=4/12/23%20%20Punchbowl%20News%20AM&amp;utm_term=Punchbowl%20AM%20and%20Active%20Subscribers%20from%20Memberful%20Combined" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ended a contract</a> with his firm last year.</p><p>“I am proud of my record in fighting back against Republican voter suppression, election subversion and gerrymandering in court,” Mr. Elias said in a written statement, though he declined an interview with The New York Times. Mr. Elias praised his firm’s effort to “find lawful and creative ways to help Democrats win elections.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He has played a key role in carving new pathways for big money into the political process and assisting Democrats as they caught up to Republicans in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/us/politics/democrats-dark-money-donors.html" title="">difficult-to-trace unlimited spending</a>, advising their efforts to use so-called dark money to finance voter registration, canvassing, post-election lawsuits — even <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/06/democrats-local-news-david-brock" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news outlets</a>. Since he started the Elias Law Group in late 2021, the firm has collected more than $104 million from committees associated with the Democratic Party and its most important donors and figures, including Mr. Soros, as well as Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries.</p><p>Mr. Elias experienced perhaps his shining moment after the 2020 election, when he oversaw the Biden campaign’s successful efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/26/us/politics/republicans-voter-fraud.html" title="">beat back lawsuits</a> filed by allies of Mr. Trump seeking to overturn his loss. The battles could be even more pitched this time around. Republicans have already filed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/us/politics/trump-2024-presidential-campaign-election-lawsuits.html" title="">dozens of lawsuits challenging voting rules</a> and practices, and Mr. Elias has been in the middle of the Harris campaign’s response.</p><p>“He’s always been a talented lawyer, but I think the scope of his impact has really broadened over the years,” said Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general who for years has worked with Mr. Elias to challenge Republican redistricting maps as discriminatory. “His growth, his prominence, in some ways I think is in reaction to the attempts by some in the Republican Party to use legal mechanisms to arrogate to themselves power that they could not otherwise get at the polls.”</p><p>Next week’s election could test his approach.</p><h2 id="link-5d78d227">Innovative Arrangements</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Elias outside the Supreme Court in March 2016, after arguments over voting rights in Virginia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">J.

Before long, he was made partner and was running a handful of key political accounts. Standing 6-foot-4 and with a rapid-fire speaking style, he was a prominent presence at weekly F.E.C. meetings, but was little known beyond Washington’s small community of campaign finance obsessives.</p><p>He became something of a star after the 2008 election, when he successfully led one of his clients, the comedian and Senate candidate Al Franken, through a monthslong recount and legal battle that gave Democrats control of the chamber. It led to time in front of news cameras and <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2009/04/franken-coleman-gravy-train-rides-on-020923" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of dollars in legal fees</a>, helping to usher in a new era in which political law, once regarded in legal circles as an unprofitable backwater, came to be seen as an appealing growth market.</p><p>He took over Perkins Coie’s political law practice in 2009, and expanded its team of lawyers, its client roster and its profits, while becoming increasingly influential with key Democratic leaders.</p><p>In 2014, he advised Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader at the time, on a <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/democratic-lawyer-crafted-campaign-finance-deal-113549" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provision</a> that was tucked into a must-pass spending bill in 2014 that dramatically increased the amount of cash superrich donors could give to national party committees. The maneuver was opposed by other top Democrats, including President Barack Obama and Representative Nancy Pelosi, who was then the minority leader, and was disavowed by Mr. Elias’s clients at the Democratic Party committees, though they came to use the new funds to pay legal bills.</p><p>Republicans would later use the funds to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/us/politics/trump-campaign-funds-legal-bills.html" title="">pay Mr. Trump’s legal fees</a> while he was president, and have since used them to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/03/us/politics/senate-republican-committee-funds.html" title="">pay for ads</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Elias did not respond to a request for comment about the provision.</p><p>As the top lawyer for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, he pushed to harness big money, at times sparking backlash from campaign finance watchdogs. In a move that in some ways foreshadowed this year’s effort on behalf of the Soros-funded PAC, Mr. Elias advised the Clinton campaign as it entered into <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/12/hillary-clinton-aligned-group-gets-closer-to-her-campaign/" title="">an innovative arrangement</a> under which it coordinated with a super PAC funded by big donors.</p><p>A federal appeals court <a href="https://campaignlegal.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/2024-07-09%20Opinion%5B2%5D.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled in July</a> that the F.E.C. should have investigated the arrangement.</p><p>Another episode from the 2016 campaign that still reverberates in national security circles and among Mr. Elias’s critics on the right was the arrangement for which he served as the point person <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/clinton-dnc-russia-dossier.html" title="">to fund opposition research</a> that produced salacious — but ultimately largely debunked — claims about Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia.</p><p>Cash from his clients — the D.N.C. and the Clinton campaign — was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/steele-dossier-trump-expained.html" title="">used without their knowledge</a> to pay for the research, which would be included in what became known as the “Steele dossier.” The clients agreed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/us/politics/hillary-clinton-democrats-campaign-spending.html" title="">pay $113,000 in fines</a> for failing to disclose the purpose of the spending.

Also following him were many lucrative Democratic clients, including the D.N.C.</p><p>In some of Mr. Elias’s increasingly frequent podcast and media appearances, he sat <a href="https://x.com/ratemyskyperoom/status/1533972021717213184/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in front of a bookshelf</a> with an Elias Law Group mug and a sign reading “Beware of Attack Democrat,” as well as a nameplate branding him a “Democracy Defender” and a framed photo of his dog, Bode.</p><p>Mr. Elias’s new firm has had a hand in several key victories, two of which came before the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=136683" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stunning experts</a>.</p><p>One decision last year forced the Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature to redraw its congressional boundaries to create an additional majority-Black district. The ruling was expected to help <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/us/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-alabama.html" title="">Democrats across Southern states</a>. An Elias Law Firm partner, Abha Khanna, represented one group of plaintiffs and joined a lawyer from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, as well as the solicitor general of the United States, in arguing the case before the court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Another Supreme Court ruling, in a case in which Ms. Khanna was the lead counsel for a group of North Carolina voters but did not argue before the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/politics/supreme-court-state-legislature-elections.html" title="">rejected a legal theory</a>, pushed by Republicans, that could have given state legislatures largely unchecked power to set rules for federal elections and congressional redistricting. One conservative expert called the litigation over the “independent state legislature” theory “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/moore-v-harper-independent-legislature-theory-supreme-court/671625/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the most important case for American democracy</a> in the almost two and a half centuries since America’s founding.”</p><p>Nonetheless, some voting rights supporters still <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=127270" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blame</a> Mr. Elias for a lawsuit challenging an Arizona law that ultimately led to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/us/politics/supreme-court-arizona-voting-restrictions.html" title="">severe curtailing of a key protection</a> in the Voting Rights Act. Mr. Elias was the lead lawyer for the named plaintiffs on the case, but appeared only once in court to argue it and not before the Supreme Court, where the six conservative justices ruled that the protection has only limited power to combat voting restrictions that disproportionately affect minority voters’ access to the polls.</p><p>The Arizona lawsuit “was not the ideal ground to be fighting over,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School who has worked on voting rights for civil rights organizations and in senior positions in the Obama and Biden administrations.</p><p>Mr. Elias rejected criticisms of the case as a misstep, saying in a written statement that “protecting the right to vote is not an academic exercise.”</p><p>To help fund and promote his lawsuits, Mr. Elias in 2020 formed three entities, all of which initially used versions of the name Democracy Docket. Two were <a href="https://www.freeandfairfunds.com/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">funds</a>, tucked inside large existing nonprofits, that raise money for his lawsuits. The third was a for-profit media outlet that chronicles legal fights over voting rights, including his firm’s lawsuits. The website features columns by him (one warned that <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/donald-trumps-plot-against-america/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s path echoes Adolf Hitler’s</a>) and hawks merchandise, including mugs and T-shirts with messages like “<a href="https://store.democracydocket.com/collections/republicans-are-not-okay?srsltid=AfmBOorq6pHoSu3IlVfURkwaCJlse-vw8UWePYGm6tjoycxd65AF5NWk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republicans are not okay</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The funds do not disclose their budgets or donors, partly because they are not structured as stand-alone nonprofit groups. However, some details can be pieced together from reports filed by the nonprofits and grant-writing foundations.

The Republican strategy for victory is to limit the franchise,” he said, calling Mr. Elias “the most aggressive and effective voting rights litigator working for Democrats.”</p><p>Despite these successes, the D.N.C., which had paid Elias Law Group more than $2 million over the preceding year and a half, decided last year not to extend the firm’s contract after negotiations broke down, though the party continued paying the firm for some ongoing services.

A Republican dark money group this month <a href="https://x.com/PhilipWegmann/status/1843632182461436215" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched an advertising campaign</a> — including <a href="https://x.com/FairElectFund/status/1844473964430754252" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mobile billboards</a> that drove by Mr. Elias’s office — casting him as a hypocrite for trying to deprive voters of choices.</p><p>The morning the ads first appeared in The Washington Post, Mr. Elias <a href="https://x.com/marceelias/status/1843643241096458691" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on social media</a>: “Republicans hate me because I stand up to them and fight.

The lawsuit came amid bipartisan national efforts <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/12/fec-urges-congress-to-close-foreign-money-loophole/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to bar foreign money</a> from influencing ballot campaigns.</p><p>The Ohio law appeared to target Hansjörg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire and a major donor to nonprofit groups that had funded Democrat-aligned ballot measures in the state. Mr. Elias had <a href="https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/murs/7904/7904_11.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defended Mr. Wyss</a> against a complaint that resulted in a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/murs/7904/7904_13.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finding from F.E.C. lawyers</a> that Mr. Wyss had violated a ban on foreign donations to federal candidates, but that the donations were outside the statute of limitations.</p><p>In a written statement, Mr. Elias suggested that the lawsuit was not prompted by Mr. Wyss, calling the foreign donation ban a “bullying” tactic by Ohio Republicans “to sabotage popular progressive ballot measures.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. Elias also defended his firm’s advisory opinion request on behalf of the Soros-funded PAC in Texas. The request, which was <a href="https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/aos/2024-01/202401C_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposed</a> by a left-leaning election watchdog as undermining laws intended to limit the influence of major donors, sought permission for the Texas PAC to coordinate canvassing with Democratic candidates and party committees.</p><p>Weeks after the F.E.C. approved the request, the Trump campaign sent a letter inviting representatives of big-money outside groups to the campaign’s headquarters in West Palm Beach, Fla., to discuss opportunities in light of the F.E.C. ruling “for our organizations to collaborate more effectively than we have been able to in the past,” according to a person familiar with the invitation. The invitation was reported <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/26/trump-2024-fec-00154727" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier this year by Politico</a>.</p><p>Since then, the Trump campaign has entered into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/trump-voter-outreach-super-pacs.html" title="">agreements to share data and coordinate canvassing</a> with multiple outside groups, including one that has received nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/elections/kamala-harris-donald-trump-campaign-finance.html" title="">$119 million</a> from the world’s richest man, Mr. Musk, and another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/trump-super-pac-voter-turnout.html" title="">created by close allies</a> of Mr. Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio.
