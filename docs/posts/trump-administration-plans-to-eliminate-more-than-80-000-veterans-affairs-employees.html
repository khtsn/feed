Some of those cuts could be made by offering <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/workforce-restructuring/voluntary-early-retirement-authority/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">early retirement</a> or <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/workforce-restructuring/voluntary-separation-incentive-payments/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">severance payments</a>, but earlier efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/trump-federal-workers-buyout.html" title="">entice employees to quit their jobs</a> voluntarily fell <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/upshot/elon-musk-federal-workers.html" title="">short of the stated goal</a> of the Trump administration to drastically reduce the size of the federal work force.</p><p>Doug Collins, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, released a video statement announcing the cuts, saying — as he has previously — <a href="https://news.va.gov/138540/va-secretary-addresses-benefits-rumors-video/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that health care services and benefits</a> would not be cut under the Trump administration and that 300,000 positions at the department had been labeled “mission critical” to ensure services were not interrupted.</p><p>If that “mission critical” designation remains, the cuts would have to come from a pool of about 182,000 workers — eliminating more than 40 percent of the noncritical work force at the department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“There are many people complaining about the changes we’re making at the V.A.,” <a href="https://x.com/secvetaffairs/status/1897386635467354408" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Collins said.</a> “But what most of them are really saying is, ‘Let’s just keep doing the same thing that the V.A. has always done.’”</p><p>He later added, “We’ll be making major changes, so get used it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The work force reductions would be a major escalation of the downsizing that has already occurred at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care for military veterans. The Trump administration had already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-federal-workers.html" title="">fired more than 2,400 employees</a> at the department — cuts that have led to political pushback from Democrats and <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/people/2025/03/gop-lawmaker-calls-va-guarantee-only-underperformers-are-targeted-workforce-layoffs/403473/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even some Republicans</a>.</p><p>Democrats denounced the move, noting that aggressive cuts at the department had already impacted some services for veterans and that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/16/us/politics/biden-burn-pits-law.html" title="">a law signed by President Biden</a> had significantly <a href="https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded the veterans benefits system</a>, requiring <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2023/11/va-attributes-record-breaking-year-massive-increases-hiring/391791/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more staff</a>.</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, described the plan as a “shameful betrayal,” accusing the Trump administration of “starving” the V.A.’s ability to meet demand to justify privatizing the department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In addition to its primary mission of providing veterans care and serving as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/veterans-affairs-coronavirus.html" title="">nation’s backup health care system</a>, the department also <a href="https://www.research.va.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oversees some medical research</a> and manages veterans benefits programs — like pensions, banking, home loans, insurance, job training and funding for college degrees. The department also manages the nation’s hallowed military cemeteries and investigates fraud in the veterans benefits system.</p><p>Each of those programs and the department’s sprawling health care system employs administrators as well as physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists, technicians, clerks, accountants, cemetery groundskeepers and case workers.</p><p>It is unclear where the cuts will come from and which programs would be most impacted by the Trump administration order. The department has not yet started an agencywide analysis of the work force to determine whose job should be eliminated, according to the memo, and will have to submit a plan detailing when and where cuts should occur.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Washington correspondent for The Times, focusing on the Trump administration and its efforts to transform the federal government.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>America vs. The World:</strong> President Trump shows how far he is willing to take ‘America First,’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-america-first.html">fraying alliances across the globe</a> with his words and actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crypto Reserve Plan:</strong> The prospect of using taxpayer money to stockpile cryptocurrencies in a national reserve has drawn criticism from lawmakers and investors. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/dealbook/trump-crypto-reserve-what-we-know.html">Here’s what we know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulating Infant Formula</strong><strong>:</strong> The new head of the Food and Drug Administration division that regulates infant formula <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/fda-infant-formula-kyle-diamantas.html">was recently a corporate lawyer defending a top formula maker</a> from claims that its product gave rise to debilitating harm to premature babies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fears of Interference: </strong>Comments from Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, have renewed concerns that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/economy/gdp-data-lutnick-commerce-secretary.html">could seek to interfere with federal statistics</a> — especially if they start to show that the economy is slipping into a recession.</p></li><li><p><strong>Top F.B.I.
