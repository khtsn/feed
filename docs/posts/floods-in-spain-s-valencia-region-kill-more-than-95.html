A popular tourist destination, Valencia is also known for being a key agricultural producer, and grows citrus and other fruits and vegetables.</p><p>One union representing young farmers in the region, the Valencia branch of ASAJA, <a href="https://www.avaasaja.org/index.php/prensa/notas-de-prensa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that while it was too early to assess the floods’ economic impact on agriculture and livestock, it predicted that thousands of hectares of citrus, persimmons, vegetables, vines and other crops would lose their harvest this season.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Some areas recorded “historic accumulations of water,” the union said, and the force of the water in inland areas uprooted thousands of vines and other crops that had just gone through one of the driest years in history.

The storm was moving toward the north and northwest of Spain, with rain expected to continue until at least Thursday.</p><p>Flooding is a complex phenomenon and while linking climate change to a single flood event requires extensive scientific analysis, scientists have said that climate change is causing heavier rainfall in many storms. Warmer atmosphere holds, and releases, more water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Meteorologists have said that the rainfall in Spain is most likely the result of a sudden “cold drop,” known in Spanish as a “gota fría.” That happens when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea, allowing the hotter, moist air at the surface to rise quickly and producing giant rain clouds. Then, the storm system pushes these moisture-rich clouds over land.</p><p>The Mediterranean is also getting hotter, which is making such rainfalls more violent and more frequent.
