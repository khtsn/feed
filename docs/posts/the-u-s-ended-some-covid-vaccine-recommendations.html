Kennedy Jr. said today. The decision was a significant departure from the government’s previous approach of recommending annual shots for everyone 6 months and older.</p><p>The announcement by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, upended the standard process for vaccine recommendations, which are typically made by the C.D.C. and its advisers. He said there was no clinical data to support additional shots for healthy children. Federal health officials did not offer an explanation for the change regarding pregnant women.</p><p>Some public health experts criticized the decision, pointing out that the risk of severe disease and hospitalization among infants was comparable to that among adults 65 and older. Others condemned the decision to stop recommending the shots for pregnant women, who are at high risk of severe illness and complications from Covid. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/well/rfk-jr-cdc-children-covid-vaccines-data.html" title="">Our health reporter Dani Blum explained the data</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians carrying aid packages in southern Gaza, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-6d9c9bf2">Chaos overran an aid site in Gaza</h2><p>Disorder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-site-israel.html" title="">broke out at an aid distribution center in Gaza</a> on the first full day that humanitarian assistance was being distributed through a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/asia/gaza-aid-wood-independence-resigns.html" title="">contentious effort</a> conceived by Israel.
