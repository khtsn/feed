    <h1>Titan and Xi Lai kick off 2025 with a bang</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2275/champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">China Kickoff</a> is underway, and began with the first pair of matches seeing the region&#39;s newest team debut and some of the offseason&#39;s busiest take the stage after a long wait.</p>



<p>After finishing eighth in league play last year, TYLOO made significant roster changes, bringing in a brand-new coaching staff and replacing two players to add to their existing core. On the other hand, Titan finished last in the region. They secured just three wins in league play, and made changes in the offseason, bringing in a new head coach and two new players.</p>

<p>The first map of VCT in 2025 saw the return of Fracture, which Titan picked, and the reintroduction of the game&#39;s newest map Abyss, picked by TYLOO. Pearl was set to be the decider, but it was not necessary.</p>

<p>Fracture, which played out with a more defense-sided tilt in this match, finished tight. After going down 11-6, TYLOO brought the score to within one round, looking to force overtime, but a carefully executed rotate on attack saw Titan close the map 13-11.</p>

<p>Abyss played out similarly, beginning with Titan looking to take a big lead and ending with a tight finish. After falling down 5-0 early, TYLOO responded accordingly, winning six of the next seven rounds to enter halftime all squared. The match would stay tight the whole way through once again, and the final round played out on the map&#39;s B site, where players of both teams tight-roped the Astra Cosmic Divide to close things out in chaotic fashion.</p>


<p><em>A tightrope act to close the match.</em></p>

<p>The long-awaited VCT debut of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2149/champions-tour-2024-china-ascension/playoffs" target="_blank">China Ascension</a> winners Xi Lai Gaming came against Wolves Esports, a team that finished towards the bottom of the region last year. Both teams made changes on and off the stage, resulting in a handful of debuts that also saw a coach take on his former team.</p>

<p>After parting ways with former in-game leader <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/5796/kr1stal">
		Kr1stal	</a>
</span> and fellow Ascension winner <span data-ref-id="11">

This match also saw new Wolves head coach <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/11216/fayde">
		Fayde	</a>
</span> go up against Xi Lai for the first time since parting ways.</p>

<p>Xi Lai Gaming won their debut match 2-0, the match played on Lotus and Split. Lotus was Xi Lai&#39;s pick and Split was Wolves&#39;s pick.</p>

<p>The three-site, traditionally attacker-sided map played into the hands of Xi Lai, who started on defense. They entered halftime with a 7-5 lead, and built upon that in their attacking half to squeeze past Wolves 13-11, winning five of the last six rounds. Wolves Duelist <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/14125/spring">
		Spring	</a>
</span> led the map in kills with 29, but his efforts were not enough.</p>

<p>Split started out with Xi Lai setting the tone, too. A flawless pistol round to open the map saw them cruise to an 8-4 halftime advantage with their attack half left to play. Xi Lai ran a double Controller composition, while Wolves opted for a double Sentinel one with Cypher and Vyse. </p>


<p><em>Crisp Guardian shots from <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/36415/viva">
		Viva	</a>
</span>.</em></p>

<p>The lead ballooned to 11-4 before Wolves got on a run of their own, but it was too late by then. Xi Lai Gaming closed out the map and the series 13-9.</p>

<p>Xi Lai starts their debut VCT season with a win and will move on to face <span data-ref-id="17">
