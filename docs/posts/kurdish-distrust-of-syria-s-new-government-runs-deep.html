But with the rebels now governing Syria, they are working to form an alliance and merge the powerful Kurdish-led military into the new national force.</p><p>Interviews with dozens of people in the northeast in late March revealed that Kurdish distrust of the new government is rooted partly in the fact that the former rebels now in charge were once affiliated with Al Qaeda. Some Kurds are also wary because the new government is backed by Turkey, which has tried for years to undercut Kurdish power in Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“How can we trust this new government in Damascus?” asked Amina Mahmoud, 31, a Kurdish resident of the northeastern town of Kobani.</p><p>Her skepticism is shared by other members of Syria’s diverse range of ethnic and religious minorities, who worry that the new government will not protect, include or represent them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/world/25int-syria-kurds-02/25int-syria-kurds-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/world/25int-syria-kurds-02/25int-syria-kurds-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/world/25int-syria-kurds-02/25int-syria-kurds-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A group of men with helmets, face covering, dark camouflage and guns sitting in the back of a truck." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/world/25int-syria-kurds-02/25int-syria-kurds-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/world/25int-syria-kurds-02/25int-syria-kurds-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/world/25int-syria-kurds-02/25int-syria-kurds-02-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/25/world/25int-syria-kurds-02/25int-syria-kurds-02-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/dfbbaa87-68b8-5327-8c57-9122baa7e88b" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrian Kurdish forces on patrol as Kurds  gathered to celebrate Nowruz, the Persian new year, near the city of Qamishli.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Internally displaced families sheltering in a school controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Qamishli.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/middleeast/syria-kurds-agreement.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">agreed on March 10</a> to integrate its military and other institutions, including its prized oil and gas fields, under the central government’s control by year’s end. It was a major breakthrough for the new Syrian president, Ahmed al-Shara, in his efforts to unify a country still wrestling with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/syria-coast-clashes-assad.html" title="">violent turmoil</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the last month, the Kurds began to reduce their military presence in the major northeastern city of Aleppo and the two sides exchanged prisoners even as the rhetoric on both sides has become more confrontational, underscoring the long history of tensions.</p><p>Initially, the merger deal had been applauded in the northeast — an area with a mixed population of Arabs and Kurds that is administered by a Kurdish-led regional government. The Kurds, who make up about 10 percent of Syria’s population, particularly welcomed a provision in the accord stipulating that they would have the same rights as other Syrians.</p><p>But doubts quickly surfaced.</p><p>Members of the regional government described the agreement as merely a first step. Important details have yet to be worked out, such as whether the S.D.F. will join the national military as a bloc or have a continuing role in securing the northeast.</p><p>“Al-Shara and the new government want to control all of Syria,” said Badran Kurdi, a Kurdish political figure who took part in the merger negotiations with Mr. al-Shara. “And of course they are dreaming about controlling all of our areas. But it’s very difficult.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Sunday service at the Assyrian Armenian Church in Qamishli.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdish flags were on display at a  Nowruz celebration near Qamishl.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ali Ahmed, 55, a Kurd from the northeastern city of Hasakah who teaches chemistry, called Mr. al-Shara “a terrorist.” He spoke as his family enjoyed a picnic in the countryside to celebrate the spring festival of Nowruz, the Persian new year.</p><p>“We know him,” he said.</p><p>He was referring to the period from 2013 to 2016, when Mr. al-Shara led Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front.
