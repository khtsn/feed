    <h1>Judge Says Trump Administration Memos Directing Mass Firings Were Illegal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Judge Alsup, appointed by President Bill Clinton, said many agency heads had indicated publicly and in internal notes to staff that they had taken the office’s memos as an order. But he said he could not stop agencies from independently firing workers.</p><p>Nonetheless, the coalition of unions behind the lawsuit celebrated the ruling.</p><p>“These are rank-and-file workers who joined the federal government to make a difference in their communities, only to be suddenly terminated due to this administration’s disdain for federal employees and desire to privatize their work,” Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement. “O.P.M.’s direction to agencies to engage in the indiscriminate firing of federal probationary employees is illegal, plain and simple.”</p><p>While he said that he viewed the O.P.M.’s actions in recent weeks as broadly illegal, he nonetheless noted that agencies could make personnel changes on their own, which could include terminating probationary workers, depending on the justification for the move.</p><p>“Congress has given the authority to hire and fire to the agencies themselves,” he said.</p><p>“The agencies can thumb their nose at O.P.M. if they wanted to — if it’s guidance” he said. “But if it’s an order, or cast as an order, then the agencies may think they have to comply, even though I’m telling them right now: They don’t.”</p><p>Judge Alsup called probationary workers the “lifeblood” of the federal work force, saying that moves to fire them en masse harmed agencies and sapped the expertise of young workers and recent graduates.</p><p>He also said he would set a date for an evidentiary hearing next month in which Charles Ezell, the acting director of the O.P.M., would be summoned to testify under oath about the memos his office had sent out.</p></div></div>
