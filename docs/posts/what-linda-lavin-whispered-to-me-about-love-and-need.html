She was radiant on Broadway and off then, in some of my favorite plays — Jon Robin Baitz’s “Other Desert Cities,” Nicky Silver’s “The Lyons” and Donald Margulies’s “Collected Stories.”</p><p>Lavin died on Monday and I’ve been thinking about her all week — but really, thinking about that comment about getting attention/getting love. I grew up in the 1970s watching her in the CBS sitcom “Alice,” playing a single mother who was a waitress at Mel’s Diner. Her character was unflappable and confident, but I remember that she wasn’t as colorful or funny as the other waitresses in the diner, like Flo and Vera, and maybe not as beloved. Her humor came more from playing it dry, straight, with great timing and just the right tone — even an “uh-huh” aimed at her son, Tommy, or her boss, Mel, could get a laugh. I loved “Alice,” but I didn’t necessarily love Alice.</p><p>During that 2012 interview, Lavin suggested to me that she knew she wasn’t always lovable. She had demons. She had high expectations for other people and for herself — those expectations seemed as if they came with a lot of pressure, including pressure she put on herself. She talked about her clash with some of her colleagues on the play “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/theater/reviews/14other.html" title="">Other Desert Cities</a>” — how she wanted to portray her character, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/theater/30desert.html" title="">a recovering alcoholic</a>, as sober through the end of the play. Some colleagues had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/theater/linda-lavin-and-the-lyons-move-to-broadway.html" title="">differing views</a> on her choice, but she was firm, drawing on her own sobriety as a North Star for the character no matter what the play said.</p><p>Lavin ultimately left “Other Desert Cities” before it moved to Broadway; another favorite actress of mine, Judith Light, took over the role and subsequently won a Tony Award for her performance. Lavin starred instead in “The Lyons” on Broadway that season, and earned a Tony nomination herself. That show offered a bigger role and she was perfect in it — another comic performance of great timing, tone and feeling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I sometimes find myself singing the first two lines of the “Alice” theme, which she sang on the show: “I used to be sad. I used to be shy.” I related to those lines, as a lonely kid who also acted for his family in hopes of getting attention. And I related to her comment about attention and love, too.</p><p>Lavin, by the end, earned enormous attention and love for a terrific body of work. She was also a complicated person with complicated needs, but aren’t we all?</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
