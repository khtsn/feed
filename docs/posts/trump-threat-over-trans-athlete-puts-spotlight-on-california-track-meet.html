Civil rights advocates responded by defending her and denouncing the threat from Mr. Trump as bullying behavior. </p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has supported transgender rights in the past, said this year that he finds the participation of trans girls in girls’ sports “deeply unfair.” Yet Mr. Newsom said he could not come up with a fair way to satisfy everyone this spring. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This week, the California Interscholastic Federation, the entity that organizes the state meet, made its own last-minute attempt to address how to keep sports fair without excluding any student athlete. </p><p>The federation said Tuesday that it would allow additional athletes to qualify for the state meet if they had been bumped out of a spot by a transgender girl. At least two competitors were added to the starting lists of the trans girl’s events, according to a longtime coach in the state.</p><p>The next day, the federation announced a follow-up policy, written in inexact terms but indicating that any girl in the high jump, long jump or triple jump who was beaten by a trans competitor would finish in the spot she would have earned had the trans athlete not competed.</p><p>Would that mean that the trans athlete would stand on the podium side by side with another girl who had finished behind her? Or that both would be awarded medals for that placement? Would the points earned by the trans athlete be counted toward the team championship? The federation did not respond to emails and voice messages asking for comment.</p><p>Competitors, coaches and families may not find out until Saturday, after the finals are complete, how athletic officials will manage the situation at arguably the most competitive state meet in the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In February, President Trump signed an executive order barring trans women from women’s sports.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>All the while, the eyes of the president, the governor, conservative activists and transgender rights groups will be on them.</p><p>“This is not fair, and totally demeaning to women and girls,” President Trump said about the transgender athlete’s participation this week on social media. </p><p>“The president calling out this issue and jumping in on the harassment and threats about a single competitor in California high school sports is absurd, as a starting point,” Amanda Goad, director of the Gender, Sexuality &amp; Reproductive Justice Project at the A.C.L.U. of Southern California, said on Wednesday.</p><p>She added that she was concerned about how the trans athlete would be treated at the meet, especially under such a searing spotlight. Others who support trans athletes in competition were worried, too, for the girl, who qualified for the high jump, long jump and triple jump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Two years ago, a pair of transgender girls were prepared to compete in the track meet of their lives. Both had qualified for the California high school championships, and some parents raised concerns that the trans athletes had blocked other girls from the meet. </p><p>Along came the hecklers and harassers, protesting the trans girls’ running in the girls’ category even though a 2013 state law made that possible. Online, the comments against the trans girls grew unrelenting, and ominous. For their safety, they withdrew from the event.</p><p>Officials are bracing for a similar outcry at this week’s meet. The Clovis Police Department said on Thursday that it would send additional officers to the event, expecting larger than normal attendance because of people there to support or protest the trans athlete.</p><p>Meanwhile, the political debate over the issue has grown increasingly heated. Mr. Trump has made it a high priority to rid girls’ sports of trans girls, even though there are very few of them competing: Among the 5.8 million K-12 students in California public schools, the number of trans athletes was estimated to be in the single digits, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said.</p><p>In February, the president signed an executive order intended to bar trans women from women’s sports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Jorge Reyes Salinas, a spokesman for Equality California, an organization that lobbies for the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. people in the state, said that the federation’s plans were vague but that it appeared to be trying its best to satisfy both sides.</p><p>“We’re waiting to see how this evolves and progresses, but at the end of the day, really the priority here at this time is to make sure that kids are able to play,” Mr. Reyes Salinas said.</p><p>Losing the right to play school sports has become a fear for the trans community, he said, considering the N.C.A.A.’s decision this year to bar trans women from women’s competitions after Mr. Trump issued an executive order.</p><p>Ms. Goad, from the A.C.L.U., said she was pleased that the state federation was allowing trans athletes to continue competing but said that moving up an athlete on the podium to share a spot with a trans athlete would be stigmatizing to the trans girl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“I’ve heard multiple alarms sounded by trans women that this is kind of caving to the belief that trans women aren’t really women,” she said. “And the ramifications of that for other contexts and other policy conversations are really disturbing.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Spectators wearing Protect Girls Sports shirts in protest of a transgender athlete at track and field preliminaries at Yorba Linda High School in California.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kirby Lee, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Keeping trans girls out of girls sports, however, is not just a conservative issue. Nearly all Republicans and 67 percent of Democrats believe that transgender women should not compete in women’s sports, according to <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f548560f100205ef/e656ddda-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a poll in January</a> by The New York Times and Ipsos.</p><p>Some groups and individuals are pushing for California — and for all states — to adhere to the president’s order.</p><p>“We asked President Trump to intervene, and he heard us,” said Sonja Shaw, who was elected in 2022 to lead the Chino Valley Unified School District and has been an outspoken voice in California opposing trans girls’ competing in girls’ sports. “The hammer is coming down.”</p><p>In an interview on Tuesday, she called the state federation’s initial adjustments on the event this week “damage control” and an admission that girls were being pushed out of their own competitions. She said that the new rule allowing more girls to qualify for the event remained unfair because trans girls would still be competing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Some athletes, parents and coaches said they also see trans girls as holding an unfair physiological advantage in terms of strength and speed. But publicly voicing their opinions can be tricky in a liberal state — and when many of them are liberals themselves. It also might seem unsportsmanlike, several coaches with athletes at the state meet said.</p><p>Frederic Laruelle, whose daughter will compete at this weekend’s track meet, said he was open-minded about other people’s gender identities, but only to a point. If his daughter lost out on a championship because of a trans athlete, he said, “then yes, it would be upsetting.”</p><p>Some parents were dismayed at the way adults had decided to go about expressing their grievances against the athlete this season, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skd92ra6reE&amp;t=235s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">staging a protest</a> outside the state track and field preliminary competition in Yorba Linda two weeks ago where the trans girl competed.</p><p>One father said that there was a time and a place for protesting and that students’ events were not such a time or place. Adults should be able to reconcile the issue, he said, and accomplish it without having teenage athletes stuck in the middle of it.</p><p>Chris Erchull, a senior staff attorney with GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders, which represents trans girls in a New Hampshire lawsuit over their inclusion in school sports, agreed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He emphasized that it was important — for the sake of the students, trans and not trans — for everyone to set aside the zero-sum political mind-set.</p><p>“It’s all so harmful to the individuals that we’re talking about,” he said. “It doesn’t help anybody, right?”</p><p>Susan C.
