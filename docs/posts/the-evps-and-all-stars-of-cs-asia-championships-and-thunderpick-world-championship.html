<p>Nine teams qualified to the event, with eight teams moving on to the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2534/vct-2025-americas-ascension/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Swiss stage</a> after RED Canids were eliminated in the round robin <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2534/vct-2025-americas-ascension/play-in" target="_blank">play-in</a>. The Swiss stage was structured in the same way as the Swiss stages at Masters Madrid and Masters Bangkok; teams with the same win-loss record were pitted against one another, with two wins leading to playoffs and two losses leading to elimination.</p>

<p>The following teams were eliminated before playoffs:</p>

</span> (North America #1)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2467/challengers-2025-north-america-ace-stage-3" target="_blank">Challengers North America Stage 3</a> winners kicked off their Ascension campaign with a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/556025/stellae-gaming-vs-tsm-vct-2025-americas-ascension-r1" target="_blank">victory</a> over Stellae Gaming. Although the series went to three maps, the round scores were dominant for TSM, who won the first map of Haven 13-3 and the third map of Lotus 13-2 with a 14-12 overtime loss in between. </p>

<p>Their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/556029/tsm-vs-envy-vct-2025-americas-ascension-r2-1-0" target="_blank">second match</a> saw them confront familiar opponents ENVY in a rematch of the Stage 3 grand finals. TSM started out on the back foot after ENVY managed an 11-3 comeback on the first map, but they quickly recovered with a strong 13-5, 13-8 showing to close out the series and punch their tickets to playoffs as one of the favorites to win the event. </p>

</span> (Brazil #2)</h2>

<p>Team Solid entered Ascension as Brazil&#39;s #2 seed after winning the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2604/challengers-2025-brazil-gamers-club-last-chance-qualifier/" target="_blank">Challengers Brazil Last Chance Qualifier</a> in September. Their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/556024/team-solid-vs-shinden-vct-2025-americas-ascension-r1" target="_blank">first match</a> was a close call against ShindeN that went the distance after a relatively one-sided map for each side, with dgzin making the difference in a 13-11 Ascent decider with a 29/14/1 KDA performance.</p>

<p>Their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/556030/team-solid-vs-winthrop-university-vct-2025-americas-ascension-r2-1-0" target="_blank">second match</a> against Winthrop was a smooth 13-5, 13-10 win to qualify for the playoffs as the only team not from North America to do so. The first map of Corrode was another stunner from dgzin, who ended the map 27/10 with an unbelievable 12 first kills in 18 rounds. The Brazilian Duelist currently leads the event in close contention with Timotino with a 1.44 rating, 297 ACS, and 1.07 KPR. </p>
