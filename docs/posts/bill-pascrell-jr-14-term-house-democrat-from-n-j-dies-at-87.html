He was 87.</p><p>His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his deputy chief of staff, Mark Greenbaum.</p><p>Mr. Pascrell, who was serving his 14th term in Congress, checked himself into a hospital on July 14 with a fever. Ten days later, his staff said he had suffered a setback while being treated for a respiratory infection and was receiving “breathing assistance,” <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/paterson-press/2024/07/24/rep-bill-pascrell-has-setback-in-hospital/74529982007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to The Record of Bergen County, N.J.</a> He had recently discharged himself from the hospital but then found he had to return, Mr. Greenbaum said.</p><p>Mr. Pascrell was heavily favored to win re-election. Had that happened — and had he lived to be sworn in in January, just before his 88th birthday — he would have become the oldest member of the House. Representative Grace F. Napolitano, a California Democrat, will turn 88 in December, but she did not seek re-election.</p><p>A former high school history teacher and the grandson of Italian immigrants, Mr. Pascrell served as a state legislator and as the mayor of Paterson, N.J., the once-thriving industrial city a dozen or so miles west of Manhattan where he was raised, before being elected to Congress in 1996.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He reclaimed the district, which at the time included 21 cities and suburbs in Passaic and Essex Counties, for the Democrats by narrowly unseating a one-term Republican, Bill Martini, who had been elected as part of the so-called Republican Revolution in 1994. A Democrat had held the seat — then the Eighth District, later remapped as the Ninth — since 1961. The Ninth District now includes parts of Bergen, Hudson and Passaic Counties.</p><p>During his nearly three decades in Congress, Mr. Pascrell focused largely on legislation that dealt with practical problem-solving and, as he put it, “helping regular Americans pay their bills.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 2009, Mr. Pascrell led a coalition of members of Congress and consumer groups in opposing the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster, which he had accused of monopolizing sales to major events.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Wilson/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>After a young boy in his district died playing football before fully recovering from a concussion, Mr. Pascrell founded the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force to focus federal attention on the prevention and treatment of head trauma in athletes and military personnel.</p><p>He sponsored legislation that established the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program, which directs federal funds for equipment and training of emergency workers in career and volunteer fire departments. He railed against “corporate welfare” and accused Ticketmaster of monopolizing sales to major events, saying that it appeared to hold consumers hostage by colluding with scalpers.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He was instrumental in getting the federal government to designate the Great Falls in Paterson as a National Historical Park.</p><p>Mr. Pascrell, who was Roman Catholic, voted in 1997 and 2003 for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which bars a method of terminating a pregnancy that is generally used after the first trimester. But after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, <a href="https://billpascrell.com/issues/health-care/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote</a> that “it is not the place for a judge or politician to interfere with a woman’s bodily decision.”</p><p>He was also known for the blizzard of news releases his office issued, at times up to 10 a day — not only about his official actions but also sometimes about matters that simply interested him. One such offering was a 700-word Labor Day essay that lauded American workers and their contributions to the nation.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Pascrell, in the foreground at right, speaking to Senator Robert G.

His father, whose family’s surname was originally Pascrelo, was a traffic manager for the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. His mother was Roffie (Loffredo) Pascrell.</p></div><div><div><p>He graduated from St. John the Baptist High School in Paterson and attended Fordham University in the Bronx, where he received a bachelor’s degree in journalism in 1959 and a master’s degree in philosophy in 1961.</p><p>After serving in the Army, he was a history teacher at Paramus High School and taught at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He also served as president of the Paterson Board of Education.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, Elsie Marie (Botto) Pascrell; his sons, William III, David and Glenn; his sisters, Barbara Pascrell and Joyce Ferraro; and six grandchildren. He and his wife lived their entire lives in Paterson.</p><p>Democrats have until Aug. 29 to put a new name on the November ballot, Mr. Greenbaum said. The selection will be made by party officials from Bergen, Hudson and Passaic Counties. Until the next Congress is elected, Mr. Pascrell’s seat will remain vacant.</p><p>In 1987, Mr. Pascrell was elected in 1987 to the New Jersey General Assembly, where he became minority leader pro tempore. While serving in Trenton, he was elected mayor of Paterson in 1990 and re-elected in 1994. He resigned both positions in 1997 to enter Congress after defeating Mr. Martini with 51 percent of the vote.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In two contested elections, he juggled the sometimes competing agendas of his Jewish and Palestinian American constituents.</p><p>In 2012, as he rallied the district’s large Palestinian American community when he was challenged for re-election by a Jewish candidate, some critics accused Mr. Pascrell of antisemitism.</p><p>In the June 2024 Democratic primary, he defeated Mohamed Khairullah, the Syrian-born mayor of Prospect Park, whose campaign focused on Israel’s war in Gaza. Mr. Pascrell said that any cease-fire should depend on the release of Israeli hostages.</p><p>Mr. Pascrell had been considered likely to be re-elected in his district, where Democrats are heavily favored.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Pascrell, right, with, from left, Representatives Donald M.

Trump, referring to him as a “crooked man,” and castigated the Republican senators and members of Congress who supported him. He characterized Justice Clarence Thomas as “<a href="https://x.com/BillPascrell/status/1643957718569418761" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">corrupt as hell</a>” after ProPublica reported in April 2023 that the justice had traveled by private jet and yacht at the invitation of a Texas real estate billionaire.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 2019, Mr. Pascrell’s progressive credentials were validated, if they needed certification by then, when the satirical website The Onion <a href="https://www.theonion.com/82-year-old-new-jersey-congressman-bill-pascrell-quietl-1836417927" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an article</a> claiming that he had asked to join the informal cadre of progressive members of Congress known as “the squad.”</p><p>The article inspired him to actually request an invitation. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Queens Democrat and a founder of the group, responded, <a href="https://x.com/AOC/status/1151201582215811072" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“You’re in.”</a></p><p>Early in 2024, in an interview with The New Jersey Globe, Mr. Pascrell assessed the demeanor of his House colleagues in a way that could have been regarded as a lament — or as the view of a spirited crusader who relished a challenge and wasn’t ready to give up the fight.</p><p>Referring to his fellow members of Congress as a scrappy lot, <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/fl/an-interview-with-bill-pascrell/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Pascrell said</a>, “If you want to fight more than you want to cooperate and get things done, this is the place to be.”</p><p>Alex Traub<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sam Roberts is an obituaries reporter for The Times, writing mini-biographies about the lives of remarkable people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sam-roberts">More about Sam Roberts</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
