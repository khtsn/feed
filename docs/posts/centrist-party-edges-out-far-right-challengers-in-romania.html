On Thursday, the court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/europe/romania-recount-tiktok-election.html" title="">ordered a recount</a> of presidential ballots after complaints of irregularities by one of the losing candidates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A decision by the court to cancel Mr. Georgescu’s victory on Nov. 24 would infuriate his supporters and risk street clashes between them and antifascist activists who have been holding daily protests in cities across the country.</p><p>In the results of the parliamentary election released on Monday, AUR, a nationalist party led by a firebrand who cast himself as Romania’s Donald J. Trump, finished second with 18.2 percent, nearly double what it won in the last parliamentary election in 2020. Two small far-right groups reached the 5 percent threshold and entered Parliament for the first time. Mr. Georgescu used to be affiliated with AUR but split from it after praising a Romanian fascist leader of the 1930s.</p><p>The legislative election on Sunday took place a week after Mr. Georgescu, a previously little-known candidate, won the most votes in the first round of the presidential election and advanced to a runoff to be held on Dec. 8 against Elena Lasconi, a centrist mayor and former journalist. An independent, he had no party competing on Sunday.</p><p>That plunged Romania — a member of the European Union and a linchpin of NATO’s defense against Russia and aid for Ukraine on the Black Sea — into political disarray, its most serious since the overthrow and execution of the communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu 35 years ago.</p><p>Ms. Lasconi’s party, Save Romania Union, finished fourth on Sunday with 12.2 percent of the vote, which could augur badly for her chances against Mr. Georgescu, a former soil expert who has spoken of Romanians’ mystical attachment to the land and traditional Christian values.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Georgescu’s win in the first round of the presidential race stunned Romania’s political establishment and its NATO allies, alarmed by his outspoken hostility to the Western military alliance, his praise for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his tributes to Romania’s notoriously antisemitic fascists in the 1930s and early 1940s during World War II.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Calin Georgescu, with the red tie, leaving a polling station near the capital, Bucharest, on Sunday.
