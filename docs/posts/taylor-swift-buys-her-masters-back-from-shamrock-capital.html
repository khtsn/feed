Disney, a nephew of Walt Disney. She did not disclose the price.</p><p>“I can’t thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now,” she wrote to fans. “The best things that have ever been mine … finally actually are.”</p><p>In her statement, Swift said she now has ownership of all of her music videos, concert films, album art and photography and unreleased songs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/arts/music/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-masters.html" title="">Shamrock acquired the rights to Swift’s first six albums</a> — “Taylor Swift” (2006), “Fearless” (2008), “Speak Now” (2010), “Red” (2012), “1989” (2014)” and “Reputation” (2017) — in 2020 from Scooter Braun, the music manager who shepherded Justin Bieber’s career and had worked with the longtime Swift adversary Kanye West, and his company Ithaca Holdings.</p><p>Braun’s 2019 deal for the Big Machine Label Group, founded by Scott Borchetta and also home to country artists like Florida Georgia Line, Rascal Flatts and Thomas Rhett, was estimated at $300 million. Shamrock paid more than $300 million for Swift’s catalog, according to a person briefed on the deal.</p><p>Recording artists frequently do not own their own masters and therefore cannot fully leverage their recordings, whether by selling albums or by licensing songs for movies or video games. While artists do earn royalties regardless, owning a master brings greater income and control. (Copyrights for songwriting are separate.)</p><p>The Braun deal “stripped me of my life’s work,” Swift wrote when the initial purchase was made public, and left her back catalog “in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.”</p><p>“For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work,” Swift added then. “Instead I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and ‘earn’ one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in. I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a note Swift posted on social media</a> at the time of the Shamrock sale, she was given an opportunity to be a “partner” with the company but turned it down because Braun’s deal would let him continue to profit from her work.</p><p>Swift then began a painstaking process of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/arts/music/taylor-swift-rerecord-albums.html" title="">making new recordings of those old albums</a> and releasing them as “Taylor’s Version.”</p><p>She put out the first one, a rerecording of her second album called “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” in 2021; Taylor’s Versions of “Red,” “Speak Now” and “1989” followed. Her remake of “1989” had a larger opening week than the original LP, debuting on the Billboard 200 chart with the equivalent of 1,653,000 sales in the United States, which was at that point <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/arts/music/taylor-swift-1989-taylors-version-sales.html" title="">the biggest opening week of her career</a>. (She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/arts/music/taylor-swifts-tortured-poets-department-billboard-chart.html" title="">topped it with “The Tortured Poets Department”</a> a year later.)</p><p>In her note to fans on Friday, she addressed the final two LPs in the project, her self-titled debut and “Reputation,.” The self-titled album, she said, has been fully rerecorded, “and I really love how it sounds now.” Work on “Reputation,” however, stalled. “The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life,” she wrote, “and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it.” She said there are no firm plans to release either record, but she’s leaving the option open “if that would be something you guys would be excited about.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Tracy is a Times reporter covering arts and culture.
