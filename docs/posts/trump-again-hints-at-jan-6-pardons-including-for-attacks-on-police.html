Trump on Tuesday once again left open the possibility of offering pardons to some of his supporters who are serving prison time for assaulting police officers during the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to restore “<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-police-violent-crime-1.7159535" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">law and order</a>,” said that the pardons he intended to offer could cover people charged and convicted of violent crimes.</p><p>“Well, we’re looking at it,” Mr. Trump told reporters at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, when asked whether he was considering pardoning people charged with violent offenses. “We’ll be looking at the whole thing, but I’ll be making major pardons, yes.”</p><p>When a reporter pressed Mr. Trump on whether he would pardon anyone who attacked a police officer, Mr. Trump deflected and suggested that his supporters were the true victims of Jan. 6.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Well, you know, the only one that was killed was a beautiful young lady named Ashli Babbitt,” he said, adding that she was “shot for no reason whatsoever.” In fact, three other pro-Trump protesters also died during the riot.</p><p>Ms. Babbitt, an Air Force veteran, was shot and killed by a police officer while she was part of a group trying to break through a door to the House floor, where lawmakers were seeking shelter from the mob. Her death has become a cause célèbre on the right.</p><p>Mr. Trump did not mention the more than 140 police officers who were injured during the attack by people wielding baseball bats, flagpoles, metal batons, broken table legs, crutches and even a hockey stick. He also said nothing about four officers who later died by suicide or another who died shortly after Jan. 6 of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/brian-sicknick-death-strokes/2021/04/19/36d2d310-617e-11eb-afbe-9a11a127d146_story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a stroke</a> that a medical examiner determined was caused in part by “all that transpired” on that day.</p><p>At Tuesday’s news conference, Mr. Trump sought to blame the F.B.I. for the riot, echoing a conspiracy theory that is widespread on the right and that was contradicted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/fbi-informants-report-capitol-jan-6.html" title="">a recent report from the Justice Department’s internal watchdog</a>.</p><p>Moreover, he seemed to suggest, without evidence, that the Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah was somehow involved in the attack — an allegation that has never come up in the multiple criminal and congressional investigations into Jan. 6.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Representatives for Mr. Trump did not respond to questions about these comments.</p><p>Even though he repeatedly promised during his campaign and after the election to issue pardons to potentially hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters, Mr. Trump has never described specific criteria for who will get clemency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump sought to blame the F.B.I. for the riot at the Capitol.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Sometimes, he has said that he will pardon rioters charged only with nonviolent crimes — of which there are about 1,000. At other times, including during an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, Mr. Trump left open the possibility that he would pardon people who attacked the police.</p><p>When Mr. Trump won the election, there was jubilation among the Jan. 6 defendants and their families who have been urging him to issue a blanket amnesty to all of the nearly 1,600 who have been charged over the past four years in connection with the Capitol attack.</p><p>But if Mr. Trump decides to do that, it will mean granting some form of clemency to people, say, who hit officers with two-by-fours or members of far-right groups like the Proud Boys who were convicted and imprisoned on charges of seditious conspiracy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After initially condemning the riot as “a heinous attack” and vowing that those who broke the law that day “<a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-on-election-and-breach-of-the-us-capitol/587379" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will pay</a>,” Mr. Trump and his allies quickly pivoted into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/us/politics/january-6-capitol-riot-trump.html" title="">a campaign to rebrand and launder Jan. 6 as a day of patriotism</a> by Trump supporters. Mr. Trump continued that rewriting of history at Tuesday’s news conference.</p><p>He portrayed the imprisoned supporters as nonviolent victims of unfair prosecutors. He falsely claimed that his supporters brought “not one gun” to the Capitol. And he implied, without evidence, that the riot was instead a plot by either the F.B.I. or shadowy foreign actors.</p><p>“They had people in some form related to the F.B.I.,” Mr. Trump said of the riot, referring to the false-flag conspiracy theory prevalent on the right.</p><p>The baseless claim that Jan. 6 was instigated by “deep state” actors rather than the hundreds of Trump supporters who were trying to block the peaceful transfer of power in his name has been rejected by defense lawyers working on Capitol riot cases, the Justice Department’s inspector general and even some of the F.B.I.’s own informants who were at the Capitol that day.</p><p>“We have to find out about Hezbollah,” Mr. Trump said. “We have to find out about who exactly was in that whole thing, because people that did some bad things were not prosecuted.”</p><p>It is unclear why Mr. Trump mentioned Hezbollah in connection with Jan. 6.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Swan is a political reporter covering the 2024 presidential election and Donald Trump’s campaign.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
