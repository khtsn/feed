Kennedy Jr., who President-elect Donald J. Trump has suggested would have a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/trump-rfk-jr-vaccines-fluoride.html" title="">big role</a>” in his second administration, wasted no time laying out potential public health measures he would oversee if given the chance.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who has no medical or public health degrees and has promoted anti-vaccine conspiracies for years, <a href="https://x.com/MSNBC/status/1854204154085867694" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NBC News</a> on Wednesday that he would not “take away anybody’s vaccines,” but that he wanted Americans to be informed with the “best information” available so they “can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.”</p><p>“People ought to have choice,” he said, adding that he has “never been anti-vaccine.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has been a prominent critic of the childhood vaccination schedule and has frequently linked some vaccines to autism and other health issues. Studies have long shown no such connection.</p><p>On the topic of adding fluoride to drinking water, which helps to protect teeth, Mr. Kennedy said the mineral was “lowering I.Q. in our children,” despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/trump-rfk-health-fluoride-vaccines-aca.html" title="">decades’ worth of studies that show its efficacy and safety</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I think fluoride is on its way out,” <a href="https://x.com/MSNBC/status/1854205733379752123" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>. “I think the faster that it goes out, the better. I’m not going to compel anybody to take it out, but I’m going to advise the water districts about their legal liability.”</p><p>The treatment of public water with small amounts of fluoride has been widely hailed as one of the most important public health interventions of the past century; the American Dental Association has said that it reduces dental decay by at least 25 percent.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy also said that if he were given a position in Mr. Trump’s administration, he would focus on eliminating corruption at public health agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Some departments, including those focused on nutrition, “have to go,” he told NBC. “They’re not protecting our kids.”</p><p>“Once Americans are getting good science and allowed to make their own choices, they’re going to get a lot healthier,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As president, Mr. Trump would have only limited authority to make some of these changes, and some would need congressional approval. But on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump said he would let Mr. Kennedy “go wild on health.”</p><p>“I want to be in the White House, and he has assured me that I’m going to have that,” Mr. Kennedy said this week.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Remy Tumin is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news and other topics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/remy-tumin">More about Remy Tumin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/food-and-drug-administration">Food and Drug Administration</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F.
