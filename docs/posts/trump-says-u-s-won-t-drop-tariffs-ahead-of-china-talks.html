    <h1>Trump Says U.S. Won’t Drop Tariffs Ahead of China Talks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Trump said Wednesday that he would not lower high tariffs on goods from China ahead of talks this weekend between U.S. and Chinese officials, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/asia/china-us-tariff-talks.html" title="">requests from Beijing</a> to do so.</p><p>Asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he would reduce tariffs on Chinese exports — which are now at a minimum of 145 percent — to initiate talks, Mr. Trump was succinct: “No.”</p><p>He also implied that the Chinese had been the ones to request trade talks, contradicting statements by China that the two sides were meeting at the request of the Americans. “I think they ought to go back and study their files,” the president said.</p><p>Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative, plan to meet with Chinese officials on Saturday and Sunday in Geneva to discuss trade and economic matters. The countries have been locked in a standoff. High tariffs have been hurting businesses in both countries, but neither government has wanted to look like it is conceding to the other by requesting a meeting.</p></div></div>
