It also takes place nearly six weeks after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/sonya-massey-illinois-deputy-charged.html" title="">fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey</a>, a 36-year old Springfield resident, whose death renewed national conversations surrounding racism and police violence and drew a direct reproof from the White House.</p><p>“Sonya’s death at the hands of a responding officer reminds us that all too often Black Americans face fears for their safety in ways many of the rest of us do not,” Mr. Biden said in a statement after the shooting last month. “Sonya’s family deserves justice.”</p><p>The two-day riot in 1908 was sparked by a white lynch mob that arrived at a local jail to kill two Black men being held there, and that then flew into a frenzy after learning that the men had been transferred to another facility. The furor — which occurred not far from Abraham Lincoln’s home — left several people dead, destroyed dozens of Black homes and businesses and required scores of Illinois state militiamen to put down. Outrage at the racial violence spurred <a href="https://naacp.org/resources/designation-springfield-1908-race-riot-national-monument" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The group asked last year that the president recognize the site, and the process continued through a National Park Service <a href="https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1207/new-national-park-service-study-finds-1908-springfield-race-riot-site-meets-criteria-for-commemoration.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> of homes burned during the riot and other surviving structures near the city’s Madison Street and 10th Street rail corridor. The designation on Friday will protect around 1.57 acres of federal land in the vicinity.</p><p>“Our history is not just about the past, it’s about our present and our future,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “The Springfield 1908 race riot national monument will help us remember an unspeakable attack on the Black community and honor the Americans who came together in its aftermath to help deliver on the promise of civil rights.”</p><p>Mr. Biden will designate the site through his authority from the Antiquities Act, a 1906 law intended to prevent the looting of Native American artifacts from archaeological sites that has been more recently used to convert public land into national monuments.</p><p>His signing of the proclamation will be the second time Mr. Biden has used the act to preserve a site for its importance to the civil rights movement. The first was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/us/politics/emmett-till-national-monument-biden.html" title="">Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument</a>, which was established last year to honor the teenage lynching victim Emmett Till and his mother and encompasses sites in Mississippi and Illinois.</p><p>Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that the president had long considered the designation of the Springfield site “critically important” and in keeping with “telling the full story of America.”</p></div></div><div><p>“We have made great strides to march toward full equality, but America has never lived up to it in its entirety,” she said.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Life After the White House:</strong>As he heads into his final months in office, President Bidenhas more publicly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/biden-retirement.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-biden-administration&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">embraced the idea of retirement</a> with a jovial serenity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden Woos Influencers: </strong>For its first conference on the creator economy, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/biden-social-media-creators-white-house.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-biden-administration&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Biden administration celebrated social media creators</a>.
