    <h1>Biden Will Designate Illinois Race Riot Site as a National Monument</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The group asked last year that the president recognize the site, and the process continued through a National Park Service <a href="https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1207/new-national-park-service-study-finds-1908-springfield-race-riot-site-meets-criteria-for-commemoration.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> of homes burned during the riot and other surviving structures near the city’s Madison Street and 10th Street rail corridor. The designation on Friday will protect around 1.57 acres of federal land in the vicinity.</p><p>“Our history is not just about the past, it’s about our present and our future,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “The Springfield 1908 race riot national monument will help us remember an unspeakable attack on the Black community and honor the Americans who came together in its aftermath to help deliver on the promise of civil rights.”</p><p>Mr. Biden will designate the site through his authority from the Antiquities Act, a 1906 law intended to prevent the looting of Native American artifacts from archaeological sites that has been more recently used to convert public land into national monuments.</p><p>His signing of the proclamation will be the second time Mr. Biden has used the act to preserve a site for its importance to the civil rights movement. The first was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/us/politics/emmett-till-national-monument-biden.html" title="">Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument</a>, which was established last year to honor the teenage lynching victim Emmett Till and his mother and encompasses sites in Mississippi and Illinois.</p><p>Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that the president had long considered the designation of the Springfield site “critically important” and in keeping with “telling the full story of America.”</p></div></div>
