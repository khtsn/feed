(Coastal areas of California are forecast to be cooler, with afternoon temperatures in the high 70s in San Francisco and in the 80s in Los Angeles.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-05-29-saturdayheat" data-id="100000010197141" data-source-id="100000010197141"><div slug="2025-05-29-saturdayheat" data-sourceid="100000010197141" id="embed-id-100000010197141">

Last year, a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822854#google_vignette" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> found a 117 percent increase in heat-related deaths from 1999 to 2023, with a particularly notable increase since 2016.</p><p>Temperatures across Nevada, Idaho and Utah are gradually increasing through the week and are expected to remain above normal through the weekend.</p><p>Salt Lake City is predicted to see its first reading of the year in the 90s on Thursday, about a week earlier than is typical, according to Hayden Mahan, a meteorologist with the Weather Service. By the weekend, the city could see temperatures in the mid-90s, over 10 degrees above normal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>By Saturday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/29/weather/alvin-map-path-tracker.html" title="">Tropical Storm Alvin</a> off the Baja coast could funnel some tropical moisture into parts of Southern California, especially the greater San Diego area, bringing a chance of light rain.
