data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, appealed on Sunday for calm and for unity as he moved to reassure the nation after days of clashes that a monitoring group said had killed hundreds of people.</p><p>“We must preserve national unity and civil peace,” he said from a mosque in Damascus, according to video that circulated online. “We call on Syrians to be reassured because the country has the fundamentals for survival.”</p><p>The violence <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/europe/syria-coast-clashes-assad.html" title="">erupted last week</a> between fighters affiliated with Syria’s new government, headed by Mr. al-Shara, and those loyal to the ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad. Scores of civilians have been killed, according to two war monitoring groups, along with combatants on both sides of the conflict.</p><p>Mr. al-Shara’s remarks on Sunday came as fresh fighting was reported in the countryside of the coastal Latakia and Tartus Provinces. A spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Col. Hassan Abdul Ghani, told state media that government forces were combing the countryside for armed fighters loyal to the deposed Assad regime.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has monitored the Syrian conflict since 2011, said that government forces were attacking with drones, tanks and artillery on Sunday. In other areas, it said, government forces were searching for armed groups affiliated with the deposed regime’s military.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, called on Sunday for unity.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Khalil Ashawi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The clashes have centered in the coastal provinces, where much of the country’s Alawite religious minority — which dominated the ruling class and upper ranks of the military under the Assad government, and included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/assad-family-legacy-syria.html" title="">the Assad family</a> itself — live. That has raised fears of a renewed sectarian conflict in the country.</p><p>More than 1,000 people have been killed in Tartus and Latakia Provinces since the fighting erupted last week, the observatory said early on Sunday. About 700 civilians were included in that figure, most killed by government forces, it said. The information could not be independently verified.</p><p>Another monitoring group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, reported earlier that government security forces had killed some 125 civilians. The group had not yet updated its casualty figures on Sunday. It said that men of all ages were among the casualties and that the forces did not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. al-Shara spoke again in a more formal address on Sunday night and said that the government had formed a fact-finding committee to investigate what had happened on the coast and to bring the perpetrators to justice. But it wasn’t clear if Mr. al-Shara was acknowledging possible killings at the hands of his forces or laying the blame entirely on former regime elements.</p><p>“Everyone knows who is responsible for this disorder and plots,” he said.</p><p>He added that the government would form another committee to help preserve the civil peace throughout Syria.</p><p>The violence has been the worst since the Assad government was ousted in early December by rebels who became the country’s new leaders. It presents a major test of the new government’s authority and ability to unify the country, which has deep sectarian divisions after more than 13 years of civil war.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Raja Abdulrahim reports on the Middle East and is based in Jerusalem.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/raja-abdulrahim">More about Raja Abdulrahim</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/bashar-alassad">Bashar al-Assad</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
