The forecast showed no signs of much-needed rain, while warm overnight temperatures and expected high winds could accelerate the flames.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Canada’s wildfire season, which tends to be the most active from May to September, had a grim start in Manitoba earlier this month with the deaths of two people who were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/canada/canada-wildfires-manitoba-deaths.html" title="">trapped and killed</a> in a small western town before they could evacuate.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The emergency orders will be in place for at least 30 days. They enable public safety officials to mobilize resources more quickly and ask for help from other provinces. Wildland firefighting crews from British Columbia and Nova Scotia are already at work helping put out the Saskatchewan blazes.</p><p>In Manitoba, about 17,000 residents are currently under evacuation orders as fires rage in the north and east of the province. As Mr. Kinew, the premier, declared the state of emergency on Wednesday, he urged residents to heed official warnings and head toward urban areas like Winnipeg, if possible, to access temporary housing and emergency assistance.</p><p>“This is the largest evacuation that Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory,” Mr. Kinew said at a news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Canadian military would assist with the evacuations, including with emergency flights, Mr. Kinew added, because of the “sheer scale” of the effort.</p><p>So far this year, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have seen the most damage from Canada’s wildfires, with 1.5 million acres burned across the two provinces, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That is an area roughly the size of Delaware.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fire damage in Wendigo Beach, Manitoba, earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manitoba Hydro, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Canada experienced record-breaking wildfires in 2023, which turned out to be the biggest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/climate/canada-wildfires-emissions-carbon.html" title="">cause of global carbon emissions</a> that year, researchers found. </p><p>In 2021, the country was struck by a crippling heat wave that wilted parts of the Pacific Northwest. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/us/pacific-northwest-heat-wave.html" title="">heat dome</a> caused 619 heat-related deaths in British Columbia, fueled a wildfire that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/world/canada/canadian-wildfire-british-columbia.html" title="">destroyed a town</a> in the province and stoked widespread droughts, prompting handfuls of farmers in Manitoba to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/world/canada/manitoba-drought-cattle-farms.html" title="">sell off their cattle herds</a>, unable to feed the animals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The country had a reprieve last year with a milder wildfire season.</p><p>It is not yet clear how this year’s season could go. But June is a critical month. That is when Western Canada tends to get the most rain, said Richard Carr, a fire research analyst in Canada’s natural resources department.</p><p>“If we get that rain in June, it might keep things a little quieter leading into the summer,” Mr. Carr said. “But if June comes out to be dry, then it kind of sets the stage for a fairly active summer period.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vjosa Isai is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Toronto, where she covers news from across Canada.</p></div><div><p>Ali Watkins covers international news and is based in London.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
