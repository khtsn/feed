Almost a third of those killed were in the county surrounding the city of Asheville, N.C.</p><p>Though the hurricane made landfall in northwestern Florida on Thursday evening, the damage has spread far and wide in the days since, with strong winds and flash flooding decimating cities and counties far from any coastline.</p><p>The damage in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee has been especially dire. Neighborhoods across the region have been utterly destroyed by floodwaters and landslides, and Asheville’s drinking water system was severely damaged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency said on Monday that officials have been working to truck in drinkable water to the city of about 94,000 people. But the lack of cellphone communication, along with widespread power outages and blocked roads, have left officials unsure of the extent of the damage in many of the small mountain towns ringing Asheville.</p><p>Power and cell service has been a problem all across the South. More than two million customers were still without power by midday Monday from Florida to Ohio, with the most in South Carolina, according to the tracking site <a href="http://poweroutage.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poweroutage.us</a>.</p><p>FEMA said in an update on Monday that more than 100 roads had been cleared across North Carolina, but nearly 300 remained impassable, along with more than 100 each in South Carolina and Georgia.</p><p>Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia told reporters on Monday that Helene “spared no one” as it ripped across the state. The death toll there had risen to at least 25, he said.</p><p>A spate of electricity outages in the state were concentrated around Augusta, a city of about 200,000 people, where most residents were still without power on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina predicted that the number of dead would continue to rise in his state as rescuers made their way into more of its western mountain towns.</p><p>President Biden said he would visit the devastated region as soon as he could do so without drawing resources away from relief efforts. Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House that federal emergency officials would not leave the region “until the job is done,” and called Helene a “history-making” storm.</p><p>“Communities are devastated,” he added. “Loved ones, waiting, not sure if their loved ones are OK, and they can’t contact them because there’s no cellphone connections. Many more folks displaced, with no idea when they’ll be able to return to their home, if ever — if there’s a home to return to.”</p><p>There were nearly 3,000 people in 78 shelters across five states on Monday morning, according to FEMA. So far, more than 6,300 rescue and aid personnel have been deployed from FEMA, the National Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Communications Commission, among others, the agency said.</p><p>Mr. Biden noted that he had approved emergency declarations in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama, as well as disaster declarations for North Carolina, Florida and South Carolina.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“There have been reports of over 100 dead as a consequence of the storm, and there are reports of up to 600 people unaccounted for because they can’t be contacted,” the president added. “God willing, they’re alive.”</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacey Fortin covers a wide range of subjects for the National desk of The Times, including extreme weather, court cases and state politics all across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jacey-fortin">More about Jacey Fortin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/roy-cooper">Roy Cooper</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/brian-kemp">Brian Kemp</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
