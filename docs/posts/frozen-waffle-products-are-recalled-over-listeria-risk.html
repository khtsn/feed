Young children, older adults and pregnant women are at the greatest risk for more serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.</p><p>Each year in the United States, an estimated 1,600 people are infected with listeria, and about 260 people die from those infections, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/about/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>“We see it most severely in people with immune systems that are compromised in some way, and that can be the very young, the very old,” Dr. Stuart C. Ray, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, said on Saturday.</p><p>Symptoms “can be as simple as a gastroenteritis, but it can be as severe as a meningitis,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>If someone is infected with listeria bacteria, the incubation period can last several days and sometimes several weeks. An infection might not be immediately apparent.</p><p>Several companies in the deli industry this year have issued recalls related to listeria outbreaks.</p><p>The deli meat brand Boar’s Head <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/listeria-outbreak-boars-head-deli-meat.html" title="">faced scrutiny</a> in recent months after one of its facilities in Virginia was found to contain black mold, dead flies and water dripping over meat. Foods distributed from that facility and containing listeria were linked to nine deaths.</p><p>And BrucePac, another meat provider, this month <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/brucepac-recalls-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due-possible-listeria" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recalled more than 10 million pounds</a> of meats and poultry products because of listeria.</p><p>Food plants and facilities are common epicenters of listeria outbreaks because of the bacteria’s ability to survive cold climates, Dr. Ray said.</p><p>“It survives on damp surfaces, including in factories and food preparation facilities,” he said. “It can be shared by animals, including livestock, that don’t appear sick. It can creep into our food chain in ways that might not be obvious.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>TreeHouse said that customers can check the lot code on their waffle products to see if they are a part of the recall. Consumers should dispose of any products they have in their freezers, or return them to the place of purchase for credit.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
