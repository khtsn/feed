Jane recounted hotel rooms across the country with linens draped over furniture to protect it from copious amounts of baby oil. Mr. Combs, she said, watched and masturbated as she had sex with male escorts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Unlike Ms. Ventura, who called the sexual encounters “freak-offs,” Jane said she and Mr. Combs used the terms “debauchery” or “hotel nights.”</p><p>Prosecutors have said both Ms. Ventura and Jane were coerced into sex with male escorts through violence, financial control and threats related to videos of the sexual encounters, which they said Mr. Combs directed step by step.</p><p>Jane testified that she continued to participate in the “hotel nights” because she was eager to spend time with her boyfriend. But she said that when she told him many times throughout the relationship that she no longer wanted to have these sexual encounters, Mr. Combs would be dismissive, and they would end up doing them anyway.</p><p>Describing herself as a social media influencer and a single mother at the time of their relationship, Jane said she became financially dependent on Mr. Combs after he began sending her thousands of dollars and paying her rent. At times, when she expressed her discomfort with having sex with other men, he would bring up the subject of her rent, she said.</p><p>“My feeling of obligation really started to stem from the fact that my partner was paying my rent,” Jane testified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As her testimony began, Jane described her early flirtation with Mr. Combs, which started while she was on a trip to Miami in late 2020 with a friend who was romantically involved with him.</p><p>“I was already drawn to him pretty instantly,” she testified, recalling how Mr. Combs hosted her and her friends at his Miami home and on a yacht. They gave each other nicknames: She was Bert and he was Ernie, after the “Sesame Street” characters.</p><p>When Mr. Combs first pursued her, she said, she was hesitant at first because of her friend’s relationship with him. But after that friend got engaged to another man, Jane began dating Mr. Combs, and she quickly fell for him.</p><p>She testified that they began a private romance that involved travel on his personal jet, drugs such as Ecstasy and ketamine, and extended sexual sessions in which he directed her on what to wear — typically provocative lingerie and high heels.</p><p>For a while, Jane said, she loved the “passionate” nights alone with Mr. Combs. Then, she said, Mr. Combs brought her to a hotel suite in Miami, where she saw assistants setting up the room with red lights and beverages. “There was a bustle of getting this room ready,” Jane testified.</p><p>A man from an escort service arrived, and Jane said she had sex with him while Mr. Combs watched and masturbated. Afterward, Jane said, she felt exhilarated, and saw the experience as a taste of “taboo.” But Mr. Combs soon began asking for that kind of voyeuristic sex frequently, and it began to dominate their intimacy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I truly felt that that night opened a Pandora’s box,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Combs’s lawyers have argued at trial that Ms. Ventura and Jane were willing participants in the sexual encounters. They have admitted that Mr. Combs was responsible for domestic violence but said that violence was linked to jealousy or drug use, not sexual coercion.</p><p>At the start of the trial, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, described Jane’s relationship with Mr. Combs as “toxic and dysfunctional” but said “the evidence is going to show you that she is a capable, strong woman who willingly engaged in their sex life so they could spend time together.”</p><p>“That is simply not sex trafficking,” she added.</p><p>The government did not secure Jane’s cooperation in the case until after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html" title="">Mr. Combs was arrested</a> in September. Prosecutors noted in court papers that Mr. Combs had been depositing payments into her bank account as recently as that month. She began meeting with prosecutors in January.</p><p>Jane took the stand after a dramatic moment in which the judge overseeing the case, Arun Subramanian, reprimanded Mr. Combs for an enthusiastic reaction during the cross-examination of a woman who has accused him of lifting her up onto the railing of a 17th-floor balcony in a violent act of intimidation. During her questioning, the defense threw the timeline of the account into question.</p><p>“I saw your client looking at the jury and nodding vigorously,” Judge Subramanian said after the witness left the stand, out of the presence of the jury. “That is absolutely unacceptable.”</p><p>Speaking to Marc Agnifilo, Mr. Combs’s lead lawyer, the judge asked for an assurance that it would not happen again, saying that if the issue continued, it could result in the “exclusion of your client from the courtroom.” Mr. Agnifilo agreed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Combs’s reaction came during the cross-examination of Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Ms. Ventura’s who previously testified that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-jane-testify.html" title="">Mr. Combs held her above the balcony railing</a> before throwing her onto balcony furniture, an act of violence and intimidation that she said caused bruising and persistent nightmares and paranoia.</p><p>Her allegation is part of what prosecutors have described as a yearslong pattern of violence by Mr. Combs.</p><p>Mr. Combs has long denied Ms. Bongolan’s allegations. On Thursday, one of his lawyers, Nicole Westmoreland, threw into question the timing of her account, pointing to a photo — dated Sept. 26, 2016 — that Ms. Bongolan said she took with her phone only hours after being attacked in Los Angeles.</p><p>The night before, Ms. Westmoreland said, Mr. Combs was performing in New Jersey in the Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour, which featured artists from Mr. Combs’s label. Ms. Westmoreland also showed a hotel bill that she said was for Mr. Combs’s stay in New York City that week.</p><p>“You agree that one person can’t be in two places at the same time?” Ms. Westmoreland asked.</p><p>“In theory, yeah,” Ms. Bongolan replied.</p><p>Asked if she had lied on the stand about the account, Ms. Bongolan testified, “I can’t agree with you.” Back under questioning by the government, she said that although she was not certain of the precise date, she had no doubt that Mr. Combs held her over the balcony.</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
