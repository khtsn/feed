Now, humanoids, machines built to look like humans and powered by A.I., are poised to move into our homes so they can help with the daily chores. Mr. Børnich is chief executive and founder of a start-up called 1X. Before the end of the year, his company hopes to put his robot, Neo, into more than 100 homes in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/06/multimedia/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/06/multimedia/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/06/multimedia/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Bernt Bornich sits on a couch while shaking hands with a humanoid robot." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/06/multimedia/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/06/multimedia/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/06/multimedia/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 768w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/06/multimedia/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl/00HUMANOID-STILLS-02-hgjl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1536w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/49aaa7b8-f9a4-58a8-a87d-5de6e52abcd4" decoding="async" width="600" height="800"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The founder and chief executive of 1X, Bernt Børnich, and Neo, the company’s newest humanoid model.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David B.
