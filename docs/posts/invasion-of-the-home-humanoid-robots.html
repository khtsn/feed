Mr. Børnich is chief executive and founder of a start-up called 1X.

But these humanoids are still a bit of a mirage.</p><p>Internet videos have circulated for years showing the remarkable dexterity of these machines, but very often, they are remotely guided by humans. And simple tasks like loading the dishwasher are anything but simple for them.</p><p>“There are many videos out there that give a false impression of these robots,” said Ken Goldberg, a robotics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “Though they look like humans, they aren’t always behaving like humans.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Neo said “Hello” with a Scandinavian accent because it was operated by a Norwegian technician in the basement of Mr. Børnich’s home.

But the technician spoke for Neo and remotely guided its hands via a virtual reality headset and two wireless joysticks. Robots are still learning to navigate the world on their own.

They had taught it to walk entirely in the digital world. By simulating the physics of the real world in a video-game-like environment, they could train a digital version of their robot to stand and balance and, eventually, take steps.</p><p>After months spent training this digital robot, they transferred everything it had learned to a physical humanoid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>If I stepped into Neo’s path, it would stop and move around me.

They have to gather data inside real homes.</p><p>When I visited Mr. Børnich’s home a month later, Neo started to struggle with the refrigerator’s stainless-steel door. The robot’s Wi-Fi connection had dropped. But once the hidden technician rebooted the Wi-Fi, he seamlessly guided the robot through its small task.
