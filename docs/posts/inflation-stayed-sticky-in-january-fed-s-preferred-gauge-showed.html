    <h1>Inflation Stayed Sticky in January, Fed’s Preferred Gauge Showed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spending fell 0.2 percent in January, led by a drop in spending on goods. Economists had expected a 0.2 percent increase overall.</p><p>To restart rate cuts, officials at the central bank said they need to see convincing evidence that inflation is indeed in retreat and headed back to 2 percent. Speaking at an event on Thursday, Beth Hammack, president of Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said it was “far from a certainty” that inflation would gradually decline soon and that “upside risks to the inflation outlook abound.” For that reason, she backed the Fed being on hold “for some time.”</p><p>What could prompt policymakers to pull forward their timing for a cut or pencil in a much steeper reduction in borrowing costs is if the labor market unexpectedly weakens.</p><p>Concerns about the economy have taken center stage in recent days as a number of sentiment surveys showed consumers souring on the outlook for growth as well as for inflation. The shift comes as households and businesses brace for policy changes coming from the White House.</p><p>President Trump doubled down on his plans to slap tariffs on two of the country’s biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. He has also threatened steeper levies on China as well as a raft of measures to protect steel and aluminum imports, among other industries. These plans come alongside proposals to deport migrants, lower taxes, cut government spending and reduce regulation.</p></div></div>
