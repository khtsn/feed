But this time there was much more at stake, with hundreds of fans crammed in on all four sides, chanting, “Let’s go, Michael,” for the local favorite.</p><p>Mr. Zheng, who grew up in Montville, N.J., and is a star player at Columbia University, was playing for the chance to qualify for one of the last spots at the United States Open.</p><p>Just like 63 other players in the men’s singles qualifying draw, Mr. Zheng, 20, needed to win three straight matches in the preliminary week of the Open to join the big boys. The 16 players who qualify gain entry into the main draw, where the likes of Carlos Alcaraz will compete for the title and a $3.6 million prize.</p><p>But standing across the net from Mr. Zheng on Tuesday was a serious opponent: Kamil Majchrzak, a 28-year-old player from Poland who was once ranked No. 75 in the world and had reached the third round of the U.S. Open main draw in 2019. Mr. Zheng had dropped the first set and was clearly suffering from cramps.</p></div></div><div><p>It was already a tricky draw, but Mr. Zheng, who comes from a family of achievers, has excelled at whatever level of tennis he plays. As an 18-year-old junior, he went all the way to the final of the boys’ singles at Wimbledon in 2022. This year, he became the first Columbia player to reach the final of the N.C.A.A. singles tournament, and this month he won his first professional title in a challenger tournament (the minor leagues of tennis) in Mississippi.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Zheng faced Kamil Majchrzak, a player who was once ranked in the top 100, in his qualifying match.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Zheng grew up playing at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center through his training program.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>He hopes to make a career out of tennis, which is only viable for about 200 players around the world at a time. The rest must fight their way in via challenger events and the qualifying rounds at major tournaments, like the U.S. Open.</p><p>“That is the goal,” Mr. Zheng said last week after a workout at Mountain Lakes High School in New Jersey. “I have the confidence to take on players at this level.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Zheng first learned the sport from his father, Joe Zheng, an immigrant from China. When Michael was about 10, he earned a coveted spot to train with elite coaches in a program run by the United States Tennis Association at the same site of the U.S. Open. The only problem was that the Zheng family lived in Montville, N.J., at least a two-hour commute by public transportation — each way.</p><p>Between the ages of 11 and 13, he made the journey three days a week on public transportation. He might have looked out of place among all the busy commuters, a slight middle-schooler carrying his rackets and homework as he trudged out of the Port Authority in Midtown Manhattan and down into the No. 7 train. It was a long ride to the mostly empty site of the largest and most lucrative tennis tournament in the world. In the summer, the program shifted to Cunningham Park in Fresh Meadows, Queens, an even longer commute, and Michael would need to wake up at 5:30 a.m.</p><p>“It actually wasn’t that bad,” he said. “You get used to it.”</p><p>Mr. Zheng loved the program, he said, and he never complained to his parents about the commute. How could he, knowing what they had gone through at the same ages?</p><p>Joe Zheng was born in 1969 and grew up in a small, rural village in Hubei Province in China. His mother, Mei Liu, was from a neighboring village. The homes in the village did not have plumbing, Joe recalled, so they would fetch their water by bucket from the nearby Yangtze River. After school, they would work on their family farms, harvesting rice. There was no electricity in the villages, they said, until they were in middle school.</p></div></div><div><p>“It’s so completely different,” Michael Zheng said. “I hear the stories and sometimes I’m like, ‘This can’t even be real.’ I’m so fortunate to be in the position I’m in, thanks to them.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joe Zheng cheered from the crowd during the match.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mei Zheng, in her bucket hat and blue sweater, was also in attendance to support her son.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Joe and Mei made their way to college and graduate school in China and came to the United States in 1998, where they earned more graduate degrees and have worked as software engineers, among other tech jobs, eventually settling in New Jersey, where Joe passed on his love of tennis.</p><p>Last year, Michael won a qualifying match at the U.S. Open, and if he could build on that and qualify this year, he would be guaranteed $152,000. That would help support the enormous bills that tennis players accrue, mainly for travel and coaching, which they pay themselves.</p><p>Joe Zheng estimated that he and his wife have spent between $300,000 and $500,000 to support their son’s ambition, and many families pay a lot more. If Michael lost in the first round of qualifications this year, he would get only $25,000.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“As long as he was working hard and having fun, we were happy to support him,” said Joe Zheng, who watched his son’s match from the stands, cheering along with everyone else.</p><p>At one point, his son was only two points from victory. All around them on similar courts, others with long journeys and high ambitions were fighting for their dreams, too. But on Court 13, the cramping would not relent, and Michael Zheng lost a very close match, 6-3, 6-7(5), 7-5.</p><p>The crowd, which has been so vociferously in his favor, fell silent for a moment, before clapping to show their appreciation. As Mr. Zheng left the court, the sun setting behind him on the same site to which he took those long bus and subway rides alone, he paused to sign autographs.</p><p>“I was just happy to be here again playing,” he said after Tuesday’s match. “Just build on that and become stronger and better next year, so I can have a better run.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Zheng’s tournament ended on Tuesday with a close loss in three sets.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Waldstein writes about the greater New York region with an emphasis on sports.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Hidden Beneath the Surface: </strong>It’s hard to see through New York’s murky green waters, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/nyregion/diving-into-new-yorks-murky-green-waters-searching-for-treasure.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">but divers are plunging in</a> to search for shipwrecks and aquatic creatures.</p></li><li><p><strong>WCBS Radio to Go Quiet: </strong>The all-news radio station was the soundtrack of countless cab rides in New York City for nearly 60 years.
