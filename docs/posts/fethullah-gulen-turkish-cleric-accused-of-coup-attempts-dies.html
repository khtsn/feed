    <h1>Fethullah Gulen, Turkish Cleric Accused of Coup Attempts, Dies</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But his detractors, and indeed enemies, accused his movement of working toward more sinister goals. For more than a decade, his followers, known as Gulenists, worked closely with Mr. Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party, angering Turks who said the two Islamist groups were working together to erode the foundations of Turkey’s secular republic.</p><p>Mr. Erdogan’s political alliance with the Gulenists began to break down about a decade ago, finally shattering after the 2016 coup attempt. About 250 people had been killed by the time the Turkish government shut down the rebellion.</p><p>Mr. Erdogan held Mr. Gulen responsible for the failed coup and began a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/world/europe/turkey-kenya-gulen.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">vast purge in its aftermath,</a> imposing a state of emergency for two years, detaining 100,000 people and purging 150,000 public employees from their jobs. More than 8,000 military personnel were prosecuted on charges of complicity in the insurrection.</p><p>The crackdown shuttered Gulenist schools and newspapers in Turkey and effectively destroyed the movement as an overt force in Turkish society and politics. Many of its prominent figures went into exile.</p><p>Mr. Gulen denied that his group had anything to do with the attempted coup and lived a largely reclusive life in Pennsylvania, a fact that fueled frequent but unproven accusations from Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish officials that the preacher was an American asset who had been deployed to weaken Turkey.</p></div></div>
