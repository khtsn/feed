Shuren was the federal official charged with ensuring the safety of a vast array of medical devices including artificial knees, breast implants and Covid tests.</p><p>When he announced in July that he would be retiring from the Food and Drug Administration later this year, Dr. Robert Califf, the agency’s commissioner, <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/9613c116fadbb8db/e0c6fb99-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">praised him</a> for overseeing the approval of more novel devices last year than ever before in the nearly half-century history of the device division.</p><p>But the admiration for Dr. Shuren is far from universal. Consumer advocates see his tenure as marred by the approval of too many devices that harmed patients and by his own close ties to the $500 billion global device industry.</p><p>One connection stood out: While Dr. Shuren regulated the booming medical device industry, his wife, <a href="https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/s/shuren-allison-w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Allison W. Shuren</a>, represented the interests of device makers as the co-leader of a team of lawyers at Arnold &amp; Porter, one of Washington’s most powerful law firms.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dr. Shuren signed ethics agreements obtained by The Times that were meant to wall him off from matters involving Arnold &amp; Porter’s business. But it&#39;s not clear how rigorously the ethics agreements were actually enforced. His wife’s law firm refused to provide a list of clients — and the agency had no legal authority to require it, said Michael Felberbaum, a spokesman for the F.D.A.</p><p>In a review of thousands of pages of court documents and F.D.A. records and dozens of interviews with current and former agency staff members and advocates, The Times identified some clients and several instances in which the Shurens’ roles intersected.</p><p>Her partner at the helm of the firm’s life sciences team began representing Theranos, the discredited blood testing company, in 2015, demanding that the F.D.A. halt an inspection at its sites in California. While Dr. Shuren said he was recused from the matter, court records suggested he remained involved.</p><p>In another case, Ms. Shuren’s firm was working on a $63 billion acquisition of the company Allergan in 2019 when Dr. Shuren initially declined to urge a recall of the company’s breast implants tied to a rare cancer.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="The glass facade of Arnold &amp; Porter’s Washington office, with the name by the entrance." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf/00FDA-Shurens-06-vqtf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="403"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Shuren’s wife, Allison W.

Two of Ms. Shuren’s clients opposed the plan; the recommendations have yet to be put in place.</p></div><div><div><p>In response to inquiries over several weeks about these cases, the F.D.A. initially said it had no indication that Dr. Shuren had violated ethics rules and needed time to “substantively evaluate” follow-up questions from The Times. In a statement Friday, Shannon P. Hatch, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the agency had found that “it appears there were certain instances from about 10 years ago for which Dr. Shuren should have either recused himself or sought ethics authorization to participate to avoid any potential appearance of bias.”</p><p>Ms. Hatch confirmed that the lapses occurred in the Theranos case as well as another one identified by The Times involving Alcon, an eye care drug and device company that was a client of Ms. Shuren’s.</p><p>In 2014, Alcon went before an agency committee convened to advise on whether to approve a lens implanted in the eye. According to a meeting transcript, Dr. Shuren signed off on the appointment of eight new voting members and a new chairman for the hearing, which recommended approval.</p><p>Ms. Hatch said the agency “has no indication that any F.D.A. regulatory decisions were impacted by Dr. Shuren’s wife’s employment nor that Dr. Shuren made any decisions in the interest of parties other than the public served by the F.D.A.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>While the agency conducts a nationwide search for Dr. Shuren’s replacement, he will work in the commissioner’s office to help ensure a smooth transition, according to the July statement by Dr. Califf announcing his retirement.</p><p>The F.D.A. said Friday, “Dr. Shuren has been advised of the need to exercise greater caution in matters concerning his recusal obligations and will be provided additional administrative support to better ensure future compliance.”</p><p>Neither Dr. Shuren nor Ms. Shuren responded to requests for interviews.</p><p>When The Times initially requested Dr. Shuren’s ethics records from the division he led, an official in the information disclosure unit wrote that the request was “complex” and would take up to two years to fill. Four months later, the F.D.A. <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/c3f6cde43f578170/e567eec6-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provided an agreement</a> that turned out to be two pages long after a lawyer for The Times had requested that a branch of the F.D.A. other than Dr. Shuren’s address the matter.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Shuren in a video posted on Ocular Surgery News last year. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>During the decade and a half of overlapping career trajectories, “Dr. Shuren has not requested, nor has he received any waiver or agency authorization to participate in any particular matter relating to his wife’s employment or any of her clients,” Mr. Felberbaum said.</p></div><div><div><p>Ms. Shuren earned from $1 million to $5 million, according to her husband’s financial disclosure form in 2018, the only one that estimated her income. Dr. Shuren’s F.D.A. salary is $400,000 a year.</p><p>Dr. Shuren led an office with about 2,500 staff members and a budget of about $790 million. He oversaw thousands of devices, ranging from tests to detect blood-lead levels to IV infusion pumps to ventilators.</p><p>Dr. Peter Lurie, a former F.D.A. associate commissioner, said he hoped the next division chief would shape a legacy that is more impartial toward device companies.</p><p>“At least from my point of view, it was too friendly to industry,” said Dr. Lurie, who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “So somebody who would better protect consumer interests would be welcome.”</p><h2 id="link-61ad5bd8">A surge in injuries</h2><p>Trained as a neurologist, Dr. Shuren once told a group of <a href="https://www.tctmd.com/videos/an-interview-with-jeff-shuren-md-jd.6297825987001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cardiologists</a> that he and Ms. Shuren had decided in the mid-1990s to go to law school together. Her career had been in critical care as a pediatric nurse practitioner. After their first year at the University of Michigan, he briefly worked for the F.D.A. and “fell in love with the mission,” he said in the speech.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He joined the agency full time in 1998, holding policy roles until he began leading the medical device division in 2009, during the Obama administration.Several former colleagues said they were thrilled to work with a brilliant, credentialed leader who came in as a reformer intent on raising standards in the division.</p><p>Early in his tenure, Dr. Shuren dismissed criticism from the business community over what it viewed as the slow pace of device approvals compared with Europe. Citing Europe’s lower standards and safety problems, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/business/10device.html" title="">told The Times in 2011</a> that the F.D.A. would stand firm.</p><p>“We don’t use our people as guinea pigs in the U.S.,” he said at the time.</p><p>But congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=E68E470D-0EB0-4544-AE9B-D7E1A92336DC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressured the agency</a> for <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/medcity-news/2011/04/kerry-brings-medical-device-industrys-concerns-fda/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faster medical device approvals</a>.

In 2012, he co-founded a nonprofit called the Medical Device Innovation Consortium with a former executive from Medtronic, a leading device company.</p><p>To do so, Dr. Shuren <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/649ffd3c686ffa81/abaf5f48-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secured a waiver</a> from agency ethics rules, which prohibit federal officials from serving on boards of nonprofits to avoid divided loyalties or interests.</p><p>Most of the consortium’s board members were device industry executives, and many of its staff members had previously worked for the industry’s lobbying organizations.</p><p>As a board member, Dr. Shuren expanded the nonprofit while facing disturbing episodes at the agency over harm done by medical devices. Thousands of women reported injuries and side effects from Essure devices — small metal birth-control implants that dislodged from the fallopian tubes, tore delicate anatomy or caused allergic reactions. Other women were outraged to discover that an F.D.A.-cleared device called a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/health/morcellator-gao-report-fda.html" title="">power morcellator</a> used to pulverize uterine growths might have actually spread their cancer.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dr. Shuren <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-and-jeff-shuren-md-director-center-devices-and-3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promised in 2019</a> that a consortium project called NEST, or the National Evaluation System for Health Technology, would “empower the F.D.A. to more quickly identify, communicate and act on new or increased medical device safety concerns.”</p><p>The group has “obviously failed to do that,” said Diana Zuckerman, the president of the National Center for Health Research, a consumer watchdog group.</p><p>Agency critics have compared the NEST effort to a fox guarding a henhouse, citing the industry’s leadership at the consortium and a lack of specific safety accomplishments.</p><p>Last year, the American Medical Association, the nation’s largest physician group, <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/19cbf9f36024d354/de172b66-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised “serious safety concerns”</a> about medical devices, highlighting <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/tag/hidden-harm/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secrecy</a> around reports of device-related injuries and a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-approvals-and-clearances/510k-clearances" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">system</a> that allowed many devices onto the market with little to no testing in humans.</p><p>The F.D.A. defended its approval process, saying it had increasingly sought more evidence before clearing products for sale. Regarding NEST, the agency noted a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106699" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, that said the program would begin monitoring the safety of two types of medical devices in December.</p></div></div><div><p>Medical specialists have also raised concerns about the safety and effectiveness of some devices approved during Dr. Shuren’s tenure. They include the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/style/coolsculpting-side-effect-risks.html" title="">CoolSculpting device</a>, which was meant to zap fat but disfigured some people, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/sports/concussion-q-collar.html" title="">Q-Collar sports safety device</a>, which some experts say may offer little protection from injuries to the brain.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taylor Jones of the Texas Longhorns wearing a Q-Collar during the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament this year.

They include replacement heart valves implanted in a minimally invasive procedure instead of during open-heart surgery. People with diabetes benefited from major advances in systems that monitor blood sugar and automatically adjust insulin levels.</p><p>The F.D.A. said it “is proud of Dr. Shuren’s commitment and integrity in serving the American public throughout the course of his extensive government career and stands by his science-based public health decisions.”</p><p>In a letter to staff members announcing his retirement, Dr. Shuren noted their mission to be sure that “patients in the U.S. have access to high-quality, safe, and effective medical devices of public health importance first in the world.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>But safety issues multiplied on his watch. The most urgent F.D.A. recalls of devices that can cause serious injury or death have ticked up, to nearly 100 so far this year, from 29 in 2012, the first year such measures were tracked in an <a href="https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/recalls.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agency database</a>. In March, a heart device was recalled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/health/fda-heart-pump-fatalities.html" title="">after 49 deaths</a> were linked to a specific concern.</p><p>Reports of device-related injuries soared to 900,000 in 2023, up from about 190,000 in 2012, according to <a href="https://deviceevents.com/about-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Device Events</a>, a company that makes F.D.A. data user-friendly for subscribers.</p><p>Ms. Hatch, the F.D.A. spokeswoman, confirmed the company’s recent data. She said the F.D.A. had noted an increase in device-injury reports in 2018, which it attributed to companies’ doing “a better job reporting problems and fixing them due to a continued, concerted effort by the F.D.A. to drive greater device safety.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/health/fda-tells-doctors-to-stop-procedure-used-to-remove-uterine-fibroids.html" title="">Dr. Hooman Noorchashm</a>, a Harvard-trained cardiothoracic surgeon, said he believes the problems are a result of low standards and deference to industry.

Top officials were to screen potential issues of concern, and other agency officials were to take the lead in such cases, according to the document.</p><p>Such agreements reflect criminal laws enacted to keep public employees from using their authority to enrich their families, and regulations meant to uphold trust in government.</p><p>Issara Baumann, a spokeswoman for Arnold &amp; Porter, said in a statement that the firm “has long had strict protocols in place to assure full compliance with respect to our professional obligations and the F.D.A.’s requirements governing financial conflicts of interest and impartiality.”</p><p>A major test occurred in 2015.
