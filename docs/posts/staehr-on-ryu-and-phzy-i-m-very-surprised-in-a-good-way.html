                  <p>After the second match, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/20304/staehr" data-tooltip-id="uid1398000757">Victor <span>&#34;⁠Staehr⁠&#34;</span> Staehr</a> spoke to HLTV about his new team, waxing lyrical about <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/16726/phzy" data-tooltip-id="uid1066209777">Love <span>&#34;⁠phzy⁠&#34;</span> Smidebrant</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/21217/ryu" data-tooltip-id="uid1957430883">Gytis <span>&#34;⁠ryu⁠&#34;</span> Glušauskas</a>.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t really know them, I never spoke to them on LANs or anything, so I was kinda excited when we signed them,&#34; the Dane said. &#34;I had no idea what we could get. I&#39;m very surprised in a good way. Both are so good individually.</p>
                  <p>&#34;Normally, I don&#39;t expect much from people communication-wise when they come from international teams. I think a lot of international teams in tier 2, they just play for the aim and play individually, but these two actually have very good vocal strenghts.&#34;</p>
                  <p>You can read or listen to the interview, in which <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/20304/staehr" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1398000757">Staehr</a> also spoke about <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1193231605">Astralis</a>&#39; chaotic finish to the match against <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/4914/3dmax" data-tooltip-id="uid1112239177">3DMAX</a> and his return to all star roles, in full below:</p>
                  
                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>Touching on the 3DMAX match, I saw at the end that HooXi wasn&#39;t too happy with the last round. Can you explain what happened there?</strong></p>
                  <p>It was just a chaotic round. We didn&#39;t really understand which each other was holding, we didn&#39;t have vent rotation, any info on it, and ryu was ready over to single door in the end. We kinda said to get away from the site because everything was open. It was just a messy situation because there was a lot of chaos. We should have played it a little calmer, so I get the unhappiness.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Before that, it was a comfortable win on Overpass. Tell me about the match overall — it&#39;s a familiar matchup for you, and other than the end of Nuke it felt pretty convincing. How was it from your perspective?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think they are a very good team, but they play a lot on gimmicks and doing moves. I think if you know how to punish that, which I think we do on Overpass, that&#39;s why we&#39;re good on Overpass, then I think it&#39;s a lot easier to play against them.</p>
                  <p>But the second they catch you off-guard, which they did a couple of times on Nuke, actually, with faking us, and we didn&#39;t know where they went, then that&#39;s where they really shine and do their chaos rounds.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>We have jabbi on B, who is probably the best B Overpass player in the world on T side</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>I think that&#39;s their strong side, and that&#39;s what happened in the last CT rounds on Nuke, they outplayed us a little bit in terms of, we didn&#39;t really know where they were, and they went to places we didn&#39;t expect them to go. That&#39;s why it was hard on Nuke and it wasn&#39;t hard on Overpass, because we punished all their aggro stuff, except for one round, on Overpass.</p>
                  <p><strong>You&#39;ve generally taken a big liking to Overpass this year after the map pool change. You&#39;ve picked in every single series you could have and you&#39;re 8-1 on it with this lineup already. What&#39;s so comfortable about it for you?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah, I think we&#39;re just a good Overpass team. We have jabbi on B, who is probably the best B Overpass player in the world on T side, for sure. The way he gets his kills, his entries, and pressures the B site is just amazing. It leaves so much space for the whole map.</p>
                  <p>And, in general, we&#39;re just five guys loving Overpass, and if you love Overpass, and you know somewhat how to play CT side, I think CT is very strong on Overpass, and I think we&#39;ve also shown it in our matches. And then T side is solely on HooXi and jabbi doing good stuff.</p>
                  <p><strong>I wanted to ask you about jabbi overall. I think he was struggling with finding his place in the last season, but this season, in Krakow, he had a couple of really big games where he single-handedly carried it, and it looks like he&#39;s feeling more comfortable even though his roles haven&#39;t necessarily changed much. What&#39;s behind that in this new setup?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think it&#39;s just about having a little more space. I think he&#39;s also, just in general, happy to get a fresh breath of air. You get new guys in the team and you give it your all. He&#39;s grinding a lot right now, and I think he&#39;s getting a lot of happiness and motivation back to really grind the game and actually be on his A game, and I think he&#39;s shown that in a lot of matches.</p>

                  <p>Even when he has bad scores, I think he does a lot vocally. I think it&#39;s just about him enjoying playing again. I think he really likes it — I feel like it, at least, I can&#39;t talk on his behalf (chuckles). But I think that does a lot, and I think that&#39;s what makes him happy to play.</p>
                  <p><strong>What do you think about this new team? International lineups aren&#39;t anything new for you after your time with Sprout, but how is it otherwise with phzy and ryu coming in for you?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think the first week was very hard, transitioning to speaking English after I&#39;ve talked in Danish for two and a half years, thinking fast in English was very hard. But then, after that, it just clicked and I&#39;m back to, as you said, the Sprout days, where I was talking in English for two years, and you can actually communicate faster.</p>
                  <p>I think they&#39;re just two good guys. I saw their names and stuff, but I didn&#39;t really know those two guys, I never spoke to them on LANs or anything, so I was kinda excited when we signed them. I had no idea what we could get. I&#39;m very surprised in a good way. Both are so good individually.</p>
                  <p>Normally, I don&#39;t expect much from people communication-wise when they come from international teams. I think a lot of international teams in tier 2, they just play for the aim and play individually, but these two actually have very good vocal strenghts. I was very surprised in a good way, so that was amazing.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>after we played a close game against FURIA, I think everyone in this team feels like we should go far</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>For you, it came with a couple of changes. Overpass, you&#39;re back on opener duty while ryu is in Connector, where you were before, and then on Nuke you&#39;re on Yard instead of Ramp, where ryu took your spot. It&#39;s not the first time that you&#39;ve been switching back and forth, going from the more aggressive roles and it didn&#39;t really work out, back to some anchor spots that you&#39;ve gone back and forth on. What&#39;s behind that? Why are there these constant switches happening and where do you find the comfort in it?</strong></p>
                  <p>I started in the more aggressive roles, as you call it, with blameF back then, and I think it didn&#39;t suit in the way blameF called, actually. For me, at least, it was a hard time when I started, it was my start to tier-one. I played some with Sprout and actually Astralis, playing the top teams all the time.</p>
                  <p>Then we got the choice to get stavn and jabbi in, and that&#39;s when we talked about if it&#39;s fine for me to give up my spots for stavn. I thought in that moment that stavn is an insane player, so of course, if I can upgrade in those aspects and I just have to be a somewhat decent anchor, I thought we would have an insane team, so I didn&#39;t mind taking the so-called bad spots, even though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad.</p>
                  <p>And now, I think when we actually had time and we talked about it with these two new guys, we could have gone for a star player and I could have kept to being somewhat anchoring, but they wanted to move me back to my positions, because they see my strengths in that, and I also do myself. Now we had the opportunity to actually do it and fulfill it, and that&#39;s why I went back to all the star roles, even on Nuke and Dust2 now, and took HooXi&#39;s spots there.</p>
                  <p><strong>You&#39;re now 1-1, so still a ways to go before you can make it to the playoffs. What&#39;s the goal here for you now that you&#39;ve gotten a bit more up to speed with this new lineup and already shown some promise with that top-eight finish in Krakow, which was even very close to playoffs?</strong></p>
                  <p>We didn&#39;t talk as a team about goals, but everyone here knows, after we played a close game against FURIA, and we beat FUT, who I think are an underrated team, they play very well, I think everyone in this team feels like we should go far. By that I mean not that we should just insta win it all, but we should show good CS.</p>
                  <p>Not that we have a specific goal of having to reach playoffs or semi-finals, but I think everyone in this team believes we can reach the playoffs, because I think, when we play good, we can play up to some of the best teams in the world. That&#39;s just amazing to see. Even in the Spirit game, we came to overtime on Dust2, which is one of their strong maps. We showed some good promise, and I think everyone expects to get some good wins and play very well against the good teams here.</p>
