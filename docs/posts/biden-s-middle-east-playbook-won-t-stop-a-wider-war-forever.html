So far, it’s managed to keep multiple low-level conflicts from spiraling into a full-scale conventional war that risks a direct U.S.-Iran confrontation.</p><p>But since Iran’s unprecedented <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/13/middleeast/iran-drones-attack-israel-intl-latam/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attack</a> on Israel in April — and a series of dangerous developments since — the landscape has shifted sharply. Mr. Biden’s playbook may not be enough this time.</p><p>Iran’s attack marked a decisive change in its regional strategy — and the security of the Middle East. For decades, Tehran has projected its military force across the region through a network of proxies and militias, a strategy intended to keep fighting out of its territory and to maintain some deniability. But in April, when Iran ignored Washington’s warnings and directly attacked Israel for the first time, Iran moved the goal posts. It’s no longer clear how Iran might use its <a href="https://nytimes.com/2024/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-military-weapons.html" title="">military</a> and<span>  </span>its network. With Israel’s subsequent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-why.html" title="">strike</a> deep inside Iranian territory, America’s script for preventing state-on-state attacks started to fray.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Preventing regional war has been one of Mr. Biden’s priorities from the early days of his administration. After the deadly attack on Israel by Hamas, a terrorist group sponsored by Iran, the Biden administration warned Tehran and its proxies publicly and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/17/biden-us-iran-regional-attacks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">privately</a> not to go further. Washington reinforced its diplomacy with rapid deployments of more forces and capabilities across the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Biden was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/27/precision-strikes-syria-biden-middle-east-iran-00124000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directing targeted military strikes</a> against Iran’s proxies, which ramped up attacks on U.S. forces after the war in Gaza began. In the following months, the president ordered unilateral strikes, first against Iran-affiliated infrastructure in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-strikes-iran-linked-targets-syria-retaliation-drone-attacks-rcna122155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Syria</a>, then Iran-affiliated <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/01/23/us-strikes-three-facilities-iraq-following-attacks-american-forces-iran-backed-militias.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">facilities</a> in Iraq, and finally against Iran-aligned <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/drone-strike-in-baghdad-kills-high-ranking-militia-leader-linked-to-attacks-on-american-troops-u-s-military-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">militia leaders</a> in Iraq.</p><p>In Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthis, claiming to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/02/07/why-are-houthis-attacking-ships-gaza-iran/72477419007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defend Palestinians</a>, launched an assault against military and commercial vessels in the Red Sea, the Biden administration pulled together two international coalitions to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-expensive-red-sea-plan-major-hurdles-houthis-yemen-1854855" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">protect vessels</a> traveling through the region and to hit <a href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3652569/us-forces-allies-conduct-joint-strikes-in-yemen/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military targets inside Yemen.</a> While the Houthis’ <a href="https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/3805451/dia-report-details-effects-of-houthi-attacks-on-commercial-shipping/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attacks have continued</a>, the coalitions’ efforts have managed to stop them from completely shutting down international maritime traffic.</p><p>This combination of tactics was working until Iran sent over <a href="https://apnews.com/article/strait-of-hormuz-vessel-33fcffde2d867380e98c89403776a8ac#:~:text=Israel%20says%20Iran%20launched%20more,99%25%20of%20which%20were%20intercepted&amp;text=Loud%20booms%20were%20heard%20in,missiles%20and%20drones%20at%20Israel.&amp;text=Follow%20AP&#39;s%20live%20updates%20on%20Iran&#39;s%20attack%20against%20Israel." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">300</a> attack drones and missiles into Israel on April 13. The attack was launched in response to the assassination of three Iranian commanders in Syria, which was suspected to be at the hands of Israel. An <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/a-middle-east-defense-alliance-is-as-vital-for-israel-as-the-air-we-breathe/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">air defense coalition</a>, which included the United States, Israel and European and Arab partners, managed to intercept nearly all of Iran’s attack drones, and most of Iran’s missiles failed or were intercepted by Israel. But despite Washington’s warnings, diplomacy and defensive military posture, Iran was undeterred. Had more of its weapons done greater damage to Israeli military sites or civilian areas, Israel would have almost certainly responded in kind, making the march toward regional war unstoppable.</p><p>Now, once again, the region is teetering on the edge. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/world/middleeast/israel-golan-heights-lebanon-rocket.html" title="">A July 27 attack</a> on a town in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, which killed 12 children and which Lebanon’s Hezbollah was clearly behind (even if it has denied it), is exactly the kind of mass casualty event that pushes leaders into irreversible escalatory cycles. Israel responded by assassinating a senior <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/fuad-shukr-hezbollah-israel-strike.html" title="">Hezbollah commander in southern Beirut</a>; Hezbollah vowed to respond. A day later, a top Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed while staying at a government guesthouse in Tehran in an attack Iran says Israel carried out. Humiliated by the security breach, Tehran also vowed to respond.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Biden administration has once again thrown its playbook at the problem. It has sent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-us-submarine-carrier-43e2574e746af59993f54e4ef250a640" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another aircraft carrier</a>, another <a href="https://www.airandspaceforces.com/f-22s-land-in-middle-eastcountering-iran-and-its-proxies/#:~:text=Air%20Force%20F%2D22%20Raptor,Central%20Command%20announced%20Aug.%208." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">squadron of fighter jets</a> and a nuclear-powered <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3868837/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guided missile submarine</a> to the region. It is applying <a href="https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/artc-blinken-urges-diplomatic-intervention-to-prevent-iran-israel-escalation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diplomatic pressure</a> to rally every ally and partner to call on Iran to stand down. Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, the U.S. military’s top commander in charge of forces in the Middle East, was in Israel this past week <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/us-israel-iran-de-escalate/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organizing another air defense coalition</a>. And Mr. Biden has sought to counter any question of the growing distance between Washington and Israel when it comes to the latter’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-08-04-2024-5b480a3b22538edec9fa05908f28303f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defense</a> so that Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah, all understand that Washington will step in to defend Israel.</p><p>But preventing state-on-state war in the Middle East is a fundamentally different enterprise than it was five months ago. Mr. Biden’s efforts didn’t stop Iran from attacking Israel in the spring; it is difficult to see how the same moves will be sufficient now. Tehran has paid no significant price for its actions, and the United States has not specifically threatened to impose costs on Iran should it attack Israel again.</p><p>U.S. and Israeli officials may still believe that neither Iran nor Hezbollah seek full-scale war. Yet both are wrestling with global humiliation in the aftermath of Israel’s strikes; there is a serious risk that their revenge instinct outweighs their pragmatism. If Iran once again ignores international pressure to hold back, it is likely to design a larger response than it carried out on April 13, which could include multiple direct attacks against Israel or coordinated attacks with its proxies in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. There’s also a risk that Iran directs Hezbollah to strike first in an attempt to drain Israel’s air defenses before launching a direct attack of its own. If Iran wants to avoid a wider war, its response will avoid civilian infrastructure and population centers. Implementing such a response — something more than April 13, but less than a march to war — carries tremendous risk of miscalculation or error.</p><p>Tehran is most likely to stand down if its leaders perceive the regime’s own security is at risk. Mr. Biden should consider signaling that he is ready to shift the use of American military force from targeting Iran’s proxies to targeting inside Iran, such as weapons storage or production facilities. The additional forces and capabilities he has sent to the region could be used not only to defend Israel after an Iranian attack but also to punish Iran directly.</p><p>European and Arab leaders should be encouraged to move their own goal posts, too. Consequences for more Iranian aggression should include economic pressure, diplomatic isolation and additional commitments between European and Arab allies toward security cooperation to counter Iranian threats.</p></div></div><div><div><p>As the world awaits Tehran’s response, other fronts are heating up. Iran’s militias in Iraq and Syria <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-personnel-hurt-attack-against-base-iraq-officials-say-2024-08-05/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restarted attacks</a> against U.S. forces last week, one of which resulted in serious injuries. Mr. Biden has not yet directed any U.S. strikes in response, which Tehran could misread as a green light to continue. In late July, a Houthi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/#:~:text=TEL%20AVIV%2C%20July%2019%20(Reuters,military%20and%20emergency%20services%20said." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drone attack on Tel Aviv</a> prompted the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/21/middleeast/israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first unilateral Israeli strike in Yemen</a>, and from Lebanon Hezbollah’s attacks into Israel are increasing even as the American force buildup accelerates.</p><p>To buy time and space for diplomacy, Mr. Biden issued a rare <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/08/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/#:~:text=August%2008%2C%202024-,Joint%20Statement%20from%20the%20Leaders,United%20States%2C%20Egypt%2C%20and%20Qatar&amp;text=It%20is%20time%20to%20bring,hostages%20and%20detainees%20release%20deal." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint statement</a> with leaders of Egypt and Qatar calling for a meeting on Thursday to finalize an agreement for a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Administration officials believe an end to the fighting in Gaza could open opportunities for a cooling on all other fronts, since Iran and its proxies have tied their attacks to the Israeli campaign there.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Biden said he expected Iran to hold off on an attack if a cease-fire deal is achieved, and Iranian officials <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/only-gaza-ceasefire-can-delay-irans-israel-response-sources-say-2024-08-13/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that only a cease-fire deal would prevent retaliation. But the prospects for the success of the talks are grim: Hamas has <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/11/gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-hamas-talks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected</a> any adjustments to the cease-fire framework, and the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-negotiating-team-fears-netanyahus-extra-conditions-for-hostage-deal-intended-to-cause-a-crisis-reports/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">negotiating team</a> of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has reportedly accused him of undermining the negotiations.</p><p>Iran, recognizing the distance between the parties, appears to be seeking to legitimatize its use of force against Israel. If that’s true, all those who want to prevent the big war should reject Iran’s cynical play and prepare actions to break Iran’s stranglehold over the region.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dana Stroul is the research director and Kassen Family fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
