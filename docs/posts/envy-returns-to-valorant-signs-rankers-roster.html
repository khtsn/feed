In the leadership race on Sunday, members rallied behind him, handing him a resounding victory. He won 85 percent of the votes.</p><p>It is a rapid rise to the helm of the country for a man who spent much of his career in high-profile but unelected public sector roles, mostly outside his home nation.</p><p>His next battle will come quickly, and it will be bigger and tougher than the electoral campaign he just won.</p><p>Mr. Carney is likely to call federal elections soon because he does not hold a seat in Parliament and his party has only a minority number of seats in the House of Commons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Between now and Election Day, which could be just weeks away, according to three people familiar with Mr. Carney’s thinking, he will try to perform a tough balancing act to try to win the federal election.

In January, the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, solidified a lead of more than 20 percentage points over the Liberals in polls, with many voters frustrated with Mr. Trudeau’s stewardship.</p><p>But that gap is rapidly closing. Mr. Carney’s ascent seems to have been turbocharged by the fact that many Canadians are seeking an expert in the economy rather than a politician.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Poilievre has understood the political potency of Mr. Trump’s threats for Canadians and has started promoting himself as anti-Trump, even though many Trump supporters also like Mr. Poilievre and the two men have some ideological affiliations.</p><p>“Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Mr. Carney said on Sunday. “Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.”</p><p>Last week, several polls showed that the Liberals under Mr. Carney could tie with or even narrowly defeat Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives.</p><p>Darrell Bricker, a seasoned pollster, researcher and chief executive of Ipsos Global — Public Affairs, an opinion research and consultancy firm, said he had never seen such a stark and swift political shift anywhere in the world.</p><p>The election is very much up for grabs, Mr. Bricker added, and Mr. Carney’s challenge will be to avoid trying to be something he’s not: a politician.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“Actually, the act of governing is the Carney campaign,” Mr. Bricker said. “His proposition is ‘I’m the man who can manage in a crisis.

The United States has imposed some tariffs on Canadian goods, while others are on a reprieve until early April. Next up are 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum exports to the United States scheduled to go into effect on Wednesday.</p><p>Financial markets are in turmoil amid the uncertainty, damaging Canada’s economy.</p><p>Mr. Trump, in conversations with Mr. Trudeau, has made it clear that his list of economic grievances is long and includes industries such as dairy and banking, where the United States faces barriers to competing in Canada.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his advisers have also raised issues that cut to the very heart of Canada’s sovereignty, including revising a border treaty and water-sharing agreements between the two nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The collection of threats amounts to a watershed moment for Canada.</p><p>“Donald Trump has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell, on how we earn a living,” Mr. Carney said on Sunday. “He’s attacking Canadian workers, families and businesses. We can’t let him succeed.”</p><p>Mr. Carney has offered a glimpse of what he’s planning to do in dealing with Mr. Trump, and it includes imposing more retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and using the proceeds to support Canadian workers and businesses harmed by the rupture in the relationship.</p><p>But he has also said that he wants to start negotiating “free and fair trade” between the two nations.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau had a poor relationship during Mr. Trump’s first term that only got worse in recent weeks.</p><p>Mr. Carney’s supporters and advisers hope that he will be able to reboot the dynamic with Mr. Trump and establish better chemistry to the benefit of Canada.</p><p>While it may not change Mr. Trump’s agenda, it could put Canada on a different footing as it tries to protect its economy and sovereignty.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>11</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Carney’s Balancing Act: Dealing With Trump<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
