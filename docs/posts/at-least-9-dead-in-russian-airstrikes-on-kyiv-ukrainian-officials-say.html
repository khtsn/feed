    <h1>At Least 9 Dead in Russian Airstrikes on Kyiv, Ukrainian Officials Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Drones and cruise missiles also hit Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, the country’s second-largest city, wounding at least two people, said the city’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov. One strike hit a residential neighborhood where rescue work continued early Thursday, he said. The total number of dead or injured throughout the country wasn’t known Thursday morning.</p><p>The attack on Kyiv was one of the deadliest of the war and the worst since last July, when Russian missiles killed 41 people in Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missile-strikes-childrens-hospital.html" title="">destroying a children’s hospital</a> in Kyiv and killing 21 people throughout the city. Recent deadly missile strikes have also targeted the cities of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/europe/ukraine-sumy-palm-sunday-russia-war.html" title="">Sumy</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/ukraine-kryvyi-ri-attack.html" title="">Kryvyi Rih</a>.</p><p>It comes at a crucial time in the war, which started with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. On Easter, a temporary truce called by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seemed like more of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/europe/ukraine-russia-easter-truce.html" title="">public-relations stunt</a> than an actual cease-fire along the front lines, but still, there were no drone or missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. On Wednesday, planned peace talks in London <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/downgraded-peace-talks-between-us-ukraine-and-european-allies-begin-in-london/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were downgraded</a>, largely because the U.S. decided not to attend.</p><p>Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has echoed Kremlin talking points in the war and on Ukraine, a reversal of previous U.S. policy. Over the past week, the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to walk away from the peace process. And on Wednesday, President Trump and his top aides demanded that Kyiv accept an American-designed plan that would seemingly grant Russia all the territory it has gained in the war, while offering Kyiv only vague assurances about the country’s future security.</p><p>So far, President Volodomyr Zelensky of Ukraine has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/europe/ukraine-cease-fire-talks-london.html" title="">rejected</a> such a deal.</p><p>Andrew E.
