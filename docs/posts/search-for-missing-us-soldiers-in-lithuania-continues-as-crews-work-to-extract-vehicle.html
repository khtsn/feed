The soldiers have not been found, and efforts to reach the vehicle have been hampered by deep mud and water from a nearby lake.</p><p>A Lithuanian official involved in the rescue mission who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter said tracks in the ground indicated that the American vehicle had veered off a sandy path toward a small pond and then turned abruptly into a wooded area that ended up being a swamp. It seemed to have sunk quickly, the person said, but it was unclear what happened to the crew.</p><p>“Although many skeptics would probably say that there is nothing to hope for in these circumstances, I want to hope,” President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania said during a visit to the site on Friday. “I am still hoping for a miracle,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The missing soldiers, from the First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, were training near Pabrade, a city in eastern Lithuania near the border with Belarus, a close ally of Russia and a stalwart supporter of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.S. ambassador to Lithuania, Kara C.

Poland, Lithuania’s neighbor and another member of NATO, has also sent military engineers to help.</p><p>“Such minutes, such circumstances,” the Lithuanian president said “only confirm how strong we are when we are together, when we are in the NATO alliance and feel the support of our friends.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump and his senior officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/europe/europe-self-defense-trump.html" title="">have made it clear in recent weeks</a> that the security of Europe is no longer the first priority of the United States, which wants to concentrate resources on its own border and the Indo-Pacific, where China has become a peer rival.</p><p>Mr. Trump suggested this month that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-casts-doubt-on-nato-commitments-as-world-leaders-reconsider-sharing-intel-with-u-s-233691717720" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Washington might not protect</a> NATO members that he believed were not paying enough for their own defense, calling it “common sense.”</p><p>Whether the disaster in Lithuania will reinforce the administration’s view that the United States is paying too high a price to defend Europe or help convince it that European allies are pulling their weight remains to be seen.</p><p>The U.S. military, in a <a href="https://www.europeafrica.army.mil/ArticleViewPressRelease/Article/4136754/press-release-recovery-efforts-continue-at-site-of-submerged-vehicle-in-search/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement issued</a> on Thursday, praised Lithuania for its efforts to find the missing soldiers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the site of a rescue operation in Lithuania on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Janis Laizans/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“We are incredibly appreciative of the dedicated and professional efforts of our Lithuanian allies in ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel,” said Maj.

Robin Bruce, a 1st Armored Division engineer, said in the Army statement. Major Bruce added, “The team is exploring every available option to speed up this process.”</p><p>Lithuania’s defense minister, Dovilė Sakaliene, told local news media that the country’s fire and rescue service had worked overnight to pump out water from the swamp but had not uncovered the vehicle, which she said was buried at least five yards beneath the surface. She added that a large dredger would join the effort later on Friday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
