Kathy Hochul’s office made clear that it supported “deporting violent criminals who break our laws,” issuing a statement that noted that the governor did not believe law-abiding people should be targets.</p><p>“Our current laws allow federal immigration officials to access any D.M.V. database with a judicial warrant,” the governor said in a statement. “That’s a common-sense approach that most New Yorkers support.” The governor added that she expected the “publicity-driven” lawsuit would fail.</p><p>Molly Biklen, the interim legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, also questioned the merits of the case. The filing, she said, was “a gross intrusion into New York’s constitutional right to legislate in areas traditionally within its concern.”</p><p>Ms. Hochul was scheduled to head to Washington on Thursday for a hastily arranged lunch at the White House with President Trump, according to a person familiar with the governor’s plans, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the situation. But she canceled the trip once Ms. Bondi announced her intention to sue Ms. Hochul and the state, the person said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The lawsuit was a fresh salvo in efforts by the federal government to force more cooperation in carrying out Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda. The administration had already filed a similar challenge against Democratic officials in Illinois. Cities in California, Oregon and Connecticut, in turn, sued the administration over its efforts to deny funding to localities that do not provide all the assistance it demands in apprehending and deporting undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The dispute revolves around the difference between state and federal laws. Immigration and deportation is a federal responsibility; states and cities often pass laws intended to assure their residents that cooperation with the police and the local authorities will not tip off immigration authorities.</p><p>A similar effort in Mr. Trump’s first term to strip funding from local jurisdictions failed in the courts. Ms. Bondi predicted this one would be successful because the Supreme Court would ultimately rule in the administration’s favor.</p><p>The announcement served as a warning shot not just at New York and Illinois, but at other unspecified states that Ms. Bondi suggested would also be sued.</p><p>“If you are a state not complying with federal law, you’re next, get ready,” Ms. Bondi said. “This is a new D.O.J., and we are taking steps to protect American citizens.”</p><p>Benjamin Oreskes<!-- --> and <!-- -->Luis Ferré-Sadurní<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
