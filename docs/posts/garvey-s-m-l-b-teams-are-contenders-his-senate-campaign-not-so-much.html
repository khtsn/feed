Still, Mr. Garvey’s candidacy has drawn outsize attention because of his years as a first baseman with the Dodgers and the Padres.</p><p>Outside Petco Park in San Diego on Wednesday night, fans of both teams were eager to see Game 4 of the National League division series. Less apparent was how they felt about Mr. Garvey’s candidacy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>David Roberts Jr., 25, a registered Democrat who works for the City of Chula Vista, Calif., was outside the ballpark with his father hours before the start of the game. The son admitted that he had not heard of Mr. Garvey — the politician or the baseball star — who stopped playing more than a decade before Mr. Roberts was born.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David Roberts, left, and his son, David Roberts Jr., at Wednesday’s game.

When it gets closer to election time, I’ll look into each specific matchup, who each person is.”</p><p>Even his father, David Roberts, 47, was only a child when he saw Mr. Garvey play in San Diego. The elder Mr. Roberts is a registered independent who grew tired of party politics. Still, he said that he leaned conservative and that he would most likely vote for Mr. Garvey.</p><p>“He’s a sports star trying to be in politics,” the father said. “If he was going to put himself through an election and a race and deal with all the mudslinging that comes with it, I feel like his heart is probably in the right place. He probably wants to do right by California.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Garvey has built his campaign around his baseball career, which ended with the Padres in 1987. His website features a graphic of him swinging a bat and wearing a blue No. 6 jersey from his early stardom with the Dodgers. A video shows him wearing a similar jersey. He promotes his credentials as a 10-time all-star and the National League’s Most Valuable Player in 1974.</p><p>His baseball statistics notwithstanding, by campaign metrics, the odds are overwhelmingly against him.</p><p>Mr. Schiff, 64, is a former federal prosecutor and a 12-term congressman whose profile rose among Democrats when he led <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000006747757/schiff-pelosi-impeachment.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">the first impeachment inquiry</a> into former President Donald J. Trump. He had raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00343871/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly $38 million</a> in campaign contributions as of July, the most recent reporting period, more than three times the <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00852897/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly $11 million</a> Mr. Garvey had raised.</p><p>Democrats have an overwhelming advantage in California voter registration, 46 percent to 25 percent, and no Republican has won a statewide race in nearly two decades.</p><p>Mr. Garvey, 75, is still recognizable among older Californians who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/us/steve-garvey-california-senate.html" title="">remember his baseball highlights and the celebrity status</a> that lingered into his retirement, but he has made relatively few public appearances during his Senate campaign. He debated Mr. Schiff only once this fall, turning down other invitations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He has tried to appeal across party lines, and a favorite line is, “I played for all of you.” He wants to control illegal immigration but wrote in an opinion essay this week in La Opinión that he <a href="https://laopinion.com/2024/08/02/necesitamos-soluciones-migratorias-viables-y-a-largo-plazo-la-deportacion-masiva-no-es-la-respuesta/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">does not support mass deportation</a> of undocumented immigrants.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many fans wore head-to-toe Padres gear, but few said they would vote for Mr. Garvey.

Many fans were dressed head to toe in brown-and-gold Padres gear, but few said they would vote for Mr. Garvey simply because he had played for the team. As with most of America, they seemed divided along party lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Waiting to enter the stadium was Sonia Guzman, 58, who works in human resources and has followed the Padres since childhood. But she said she did not favor Mr. Garvey.</p><p>“He’s a little conservative for myself,” she said. “He aligns very closely with Donald Trump, and I will not be involved with that.”</p><p>Shawn Hubler<!-- --> contributed reporting from Sacramento.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/major-league-baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/los-angeles-dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/san-diego-padres">San Diego Padres</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/steve-garvey">Steve Garvey</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/adam-b-schiff">Adam B Schiff</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
