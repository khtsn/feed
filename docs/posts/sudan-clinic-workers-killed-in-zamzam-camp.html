They then destroyed hundreds of homes and the camp’s main market before turning their attack on the camp’s last remaining medical clinic, according to Relief International, the aid group that runs the facility.</p><p>Nine hospital employees were killed, including the head doctor, the aid group <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/relief-international_relief-international-is-devastated-to-report-activity-7316838235903586304-txhY/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAehs78BIKTJ03xNABTao4gLp_KF7wsbzdo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Saturday. “We have learned the unthinkable,” the statement said. “This is a profound tragedy for our organization.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Kashif Shafique, the group’s Sudan director, said in a phone interview that the aid workers — five medics and four drivers, his entire staff at the clinic — had been shot dead.</p><p>Paramilitaries had warned the medics to leave the day before the attack, Mr. Shafique said.

The group called it “the most significant ground-based attack” on Zamzam camp in a year.</p><p>The escalating violence comes days before a major international conference on Sudan that is scheduled to take place in London on Tuesday, the second anniversary of the war. The purpose of the conference is to attract funds for Sudan’s severe humanitarian crisis. So far, donors have committed to just 10 percent of a $4.2 billion appeal by the United Nations.</p><p>The conference has stoked criticism from some Sudanese because it will be attended by delegates from the United Arab Emirates, which has been accused of providing military and financial support to the R.S.F.</p><p>Human Rights Watch urged the U.N. Security Council to impose sanctions on R.S.F. commanders responsible for abuses, and to condemn “countries providing support to parties in violation of the ongoing U.N. arms embargo.”</p><p>“Global leaders need to act,” the organization <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/04/11/civilians-around-sudans-el-fasher-face-new-attacks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement.</a></p><p>Both sides in Sudan’s war have been accused of war crimes by right groups, the United Nations and the United States, although only the R.S.F. has been accused of genocide. Sudan’s military has regularly been accused of indiscriminately bombing crowded markets, often in the Darfur region, in multiple incidents that have sometimes killed more than 100 people at a time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Earlier this month, the top United Nations human rights official, Volker Türk, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/04/11/civilians-around-sudans-el-fasher-face-new-attacks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said he was “utterly appalled”</a> by reports of widespread summary executions of civilians in the capital, Khartoum, following the city’s recapture by the Sudanese military.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Refugees at the Adre camp in Chad last July.
