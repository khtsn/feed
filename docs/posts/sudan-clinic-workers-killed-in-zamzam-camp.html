They then destroyed hundreds of homes and the camp’s main market before turning their attack on the camp’s last remaining medical clinic, according to Relief International, the aid group that runs the facility.</p><p>Nine hospital employees were killed, including the head doctor, the aid group <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/relief-international_relief-international-is-devastated-to-report-activity-7316838235903586304-txhY/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAehs78BIKTJ03xNABTao4gLp_KF7wsbzdo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Saturday. “We have learned the unthinkable,” the statement said. “This is a profound tragedy for our organization.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Kashif Shafique, the group’s Sudan director, said in a phone interview that the aid workers — five medics and four drivers, his entire staff at the clinic — had been shot dead.</p><p>Paramilitaries had warned the medics to leave the day before the attack, Mr. Shafique said. But they had to treat civilians wounded by shelling and, in any event, the main routes out of the camp were closed.</p><p>“There was no way out,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A satellite image taken by Maxar Technologies on Jan. 14 shows the entrance to the Zamzam camp near North Darfur’s besieged capital, El Fasher.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxar Technologies</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A satellite image taken by Maxar Technologies on Feb. 13 shows heavy damage at the entrance to the Zamzam camp.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxar Technologies</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The R.S.F. has been battling Sudan’s military since April 2023, in a sprawling conflict that has caused the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. As many as 150,000 Sudanese have been killed, according to U.S. estimates, and 13 million have been forced from their homes.</p><p>The head of the United Nations in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/attacks-zamzam-and-abu-shouk-camps-and-al-fasher-must-end-now-statement-united-nations-resident-and-humanitarian-coordinator-sudan-clementine-nkweta-salami" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> she was “appalled and gravely alarmed” by the violence in El Fasher, which continued into Saturday. At least 20 children were among 100 people killed, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some local groups <a href="https://x.com/dvsorg/status/1910923118656241694?s=48" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">circulated</a> videos of bodies strewn across the camp, which The New York Times was unable to verify.</p><p>Satellite images <a href="https://x.com/HRL_YaleSPH/status/1910775229968007495" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on Friday by the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health showed military vehicles near the camp and fires burning inside it. The group called it “the most significant ground-based attack” on Zamzam camp in a year.</p><p>The escalating violence comes days before a major international conference on Sudan that is scheduled to take place in London on Tuesday, the second anniversary of the war. The purpose of the conference is to attract funds for Sudan’s severe humanitarian crisis. So far, donors have committed to just 10 percent of a $4.2 billion appeal by the United Nations.</p><p>The conference has stoked criticism from some Sudanese because it will be attended by delegates from the United Arab Emirates, which has been accused of providing military and financial support to the R.S.F.</p><p>Human Rights Watch urged the U.N. Security Council to impose sanctions on R.S.F. commanders responsible for abuses, and to condemn “countries providing support to parties in violation of the ongoing U.N. arms embargo.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Global leaders need to act,” the organization <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/04/11/civilians-around-sudans-el-fasher-face-new-attacks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement.</a></p><p>Both sides in Sudan’s war have been accused of war crimes by right groups, the United Nations and the United States, although only the R.S.F. has been accused of genocide. Sudan’s military has regularly been accused of indiscriminately bombing crowded markets, often in the Darfur region, in multiple incidents that have sometimes killed more than 100 people at a time.</p><p>Earlier this month, the top United Nations human rights official, Volker Türk, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/04/11/civilians-around-sudans-el-fasher-face-new-attacks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said he was “utterly appalled”</a> by reports of widespread summary executions of civilians in the capital, Khartoum, following the city’s recapture by the Sudanese military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Refugees at the Adre camp in Chad last July.

It had been expected to step up the assault in recent weeks, since R.S.F. forces were expelled from Khartoum by the military in late March.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>There were signs for days before Friday’s violence that a major attack was imminent.</p><p>Video of the R.S.F. deputy leader Abdul Rahim Dagalo <a href="https://x.com/wjrs352688/status/1909601021082714588" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mobilizing</a> his forces in the area circulated on social media. On Thursday, the R.S.F. began to shell Abu Shouk, another camp in the north of the city, killing at least 12 people, according to local rescue workers.</p><p>The fighters also began to attack Zamzam camp with artillery, gunfire and drones, according to aid groups and local activists.
