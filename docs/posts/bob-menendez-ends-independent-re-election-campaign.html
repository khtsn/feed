He had planned to run as an independent.</p><p>“I am advising you that I wish to have my name withdrawn from the ballot,” Mr. Menendez wrote in a one-sentence email to the New Jersey Division of Elections.</p><p>Mr. Menendez, 70, was found guilty of taking bribes and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/nyregion/senator-bob-menendez-trial.html" title="">acting as an agent of Egypt</a> after a two-month trial in Manhattan, and he had virtually no chance of winning re-election.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He had not mounted a campaign and is reliant on his shrinking election war chest to pay lawyers as he prepares to appeal his conviction on 16 criminal counts. He has also dipped into his campaign funds to pay lawyers representing his wife, Nadine Menendez, who is awaiting trial on charges that she traded her husband’s political influence for cash, gold and a Mercedes-Benz convertible.</p><p>But until Friday it was unclear whether voters might get one more chance to cast a vote for Mr. Menendez, who has lost only one campaign in his storied political career — his first race for mayor of Union City, N.J., in 1982.</p><p>Mr. Menendez <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/nyregion/robert-menendez-reelection.html" title="">did not compete in the Democratic primary</a> in June, but he did file three times the requisite number of signatures needed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/nyregion/senator-robert-menendez-independent-campaign.html" title="">lock in a spot on the ballot</a> in November. He had until the end of Friday to pull his name off the ballot.</p><p>Had he opted against bowing out, he would have faced off against Curtis Bashaw, a Republican hotel developer, and Representative Andy Kim, a third-term congressman who won the Democratic primary with 75 percent of the vote and is heavily favored to win in November. Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by nearly <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/svrs-reports/2024/2024-08-voter-registration-by-congressional-district.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one million registered voters</a>, and it has been more than 50 years since the state elected a Republican senator.</p><p>Mr. Kim, 42, said he doubted that Mr. Menendez would have had a meaningful effect on the race results.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I’m not particularly concerned,” Mr. Kim said after a campaign event in Maywood, N.J., just before Mr. Menendez’s letter was filed. “It’s not keeping me up at night.”</p><p>Mr. Menendez can continue to use his remaining <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00264564/1800936/#SUMMARY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.3 million in campaign funds</a> to pay legal fees even though he is no longer running for office. But he is now precluded from accepting additional campaign contributions, which had tapered off drastically since he was indicted in September. He took in just $731.50 from mid-May through the end of June, according to his most recent <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00264564/1800936/#SUMMARY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Election Commission filing</a>.</p><p>There was more activity in a defense fund he had established to help pay his legal fees. Twenty-one donors contributed a total of <a href="https://forms.irs.gov/app/pod/basicSearch/downloadFile?formId=149333&amp;formType=e8872" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$127,500</a> between April and July, federal records show. He can legally continue to accept donations to the defense fund, regardless of his status as a candidate.</p><p>Mr. Menendez’s legal woes have proved to be a source of significant embarrassment for Democrats struggling to hold on to the White House and retain their narrow margin in the Senate.</p><p>Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader, refrained from calling for Mr. Menendez’s resignation until after his conviction. On Friday, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer had no immediate comment on Mr. Menendez’s decision to abandon his race for re-election.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Bashaw, the Republican hoping to replace Mr. Menendez in Washington, said it was “time to move on with this election and make it a clean, straightforward race focusing on the issues facing our state.”</p><p>Ms. Menendez’s trial has been delayed while she is being treated for breast cancer. Friday was also the deadline for her lawyers to provide Judge Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court with additional medical records that may be used to determine when Ms. Menendez, 57, might be ready to stand trial.</p><p>As of late Friday afternoon, there was no record that her lawyer, Barry Coburn, had filed the requested documents, which are likely to be sealed from public view to safeguard Ms. Menendez’s medical privacy. Mr. Coburn said he had no comment.</p><p>Mr. Menendez, his two co-defendants and a disgraced insurance broker who pleaded guilty and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/nyregion/robert-menendez-bribery-trial.html" title="">testified against the senator</a> during the trial are all scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 29. Each faces decades in prison.</p><p>A week after his conviction, Mr. Menendez said he would step down from his Senate seat at the end of the day on Aug. 20.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Earlier on Friday, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced that he had selected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/menendez-george-helmy-senate-seat.html" title="">George Helmy</a>, his former chief of staff, to replace Mr. Menendez in the Senate through the Nov. 5 election.</p><p>After the election, Mr. Helmy, 44, will step down and the governor will appoint the winner of the Senate race to the seat, roughly two months early.</p><p>Mr. Kim said he supported the governor’s plan to keep Mr. Helmy in the temporary role only until voters had decided who will represent New Jersey in the Senate for the next six years.</p><p>“You should want to try to keep that as short as possible,” Mr. Kim said, “and if you have the opportunity to have a duly elected person come in — I think that’s good.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tracey-tully">More about Tracey Tully</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>13</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Menendez Pulls Name From Ballot For Senate<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
