The plant, owned by Holtec International, shut down in 2018 and is being decommissioned.</p><p>Patrick O’Brien, a Holtec spokesman, said the fires closest to the facility had been “completely and safely extinguished.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Even if a blaze were to reach an area where spent nuclear material is stored in secure casks, it poses no risk, according to Mr. O’Brien and Shawn M. LaTourette, commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Protection.</p><p>All the buildings at the Oyster Creek site are “designed and constructed to withstand fires,” Mr. O’Brien said in a statement.</p><p>“There is not a concern to the security of the material in cask storage,” Mr. LaTourette said. “Dried cask storage is designed to handle much higher temperatures than a wildfire.”</p><p>The fire service said that the blaze was 5 percent contained as of 8 p.m. and that a local high school was being used as an evacuation shelter. No injuries had been reported.</p><p>An estimated 130 fire service firefighters were battling the blaze, and officials with the state’s radiation monitoring unit were also on site, Mr. LaTourette said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Images posted on social media showed a thick haze of smoke shrouding the parkway near the Waretown exit and flames rising just beyond a guardrail on one side of the highway.</p><p>Officials did not provide an estimate for when the fire might be brought under control. The cause was under investigation, officials said, as firefighters, aided by other state, local and county agencies, battled the flames using fire engines, bulldozers and ground crews.</p><p>A helicopter able to drop 300 gallons of water and a contract air tanker able to drop double that amount were also being deployed, <a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/local/emergencies/2025/04/22/nj-wildfire-jones-road-barnegat-waretown/83210090007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Asbury Park Press reported</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>About 23,000 Jersey Central Power &amp; Light customers in the area were without power as of 8 p.m., according to Chris Hoenig, a company spokesman. He said that fire and emergency management officials asked the company around 6 p.m. to shut off power into and out of a nearby substation as a safety measure, and that power would be restored “as safety allows.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Several dozen cars were in a park-and-ride lot in the closed section of the parkway, at the Celia Cruz Service Area in Forked River, according to Tom Feeney, a New Jersey Turnpike Authority spokesman. Those with cars to retrieve should call the authority’s operations center for information on how to do that, he said.</p><p>At 1.1 million acres, the Pine Barrens, also known as the Pinelands, <a href="https://pinelandsalliance.org/learn-about-the-pinelands/pinelands-overview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is the largest forested area</a> on the Eastern Seaboard between Maine and the Florida Everglades and a frequent setting for wildfires.</p><p>As in much of the rest of the country, last year was particularly bad for wildfires in New Jersey. From early October through Nov. 20, the forest fire service responded to more than 10 times the number of fires as it had in the same period in 2023.</p><p>“We have never experienced conditions like this,” Bill Donnelly, chief of the fire service, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/nyregion/new-york-wildfires-drought.html" title="">said then</a>.</p><p>The area where the fire began is in a part of New Jersey where conditions ranged from abnormally dry to severe drought as of April 15, according to data <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?NJ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from the U.S. Drought Monitor</a>. The fire risk across South Jersey was high as of Tuesday, according to <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the forest fire service</a>.</p><p>“It’s incredibly dry,” Mr. LaTourette said, “and has been for a while.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.</p></div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
