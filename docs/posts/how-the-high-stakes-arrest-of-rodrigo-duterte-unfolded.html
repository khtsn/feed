Former President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines was going to a rally in Hong Kong during the second weekend in March. But as soon as it began, the trip took on a tantalizing element of intrigue: Was he ever coming back?</p><p>To many Filipinos, it appeared that Mr. Duterte was trying to outrun justice. The International Criminal Court, a sudden swirl of speculation in the Philippines posited, was about to seek his arrest, years after it started investigating the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/world/asia/philippines-drug-war-duterte-justice.html" title="">deadly antidrug campaign</a> he had overseen as president and as mayor of Davao. By being in Hong Kong, the theory went, Mr. Duterte would remain free because China is not a member of the court.</p><p>Soon after Mr. Duterte, 79, landed in Hong Kong on March 7, the I.C.C. issued a sealed warrant for him. But wind of the move reached him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Over that weekend in Hong Kong, his entourage — which included his partner, Honeylet Avanceña, and daughter Sara Duterte, the current vice president — debated whether to stay in Chinese territory or return home, according to two Philippine officials and a former lawmaker who spoke on the record and cited Philippines intelligence.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On March 9, the day before his arrest in the Philippines, Mr. Duterte was in Hong Kong, addressing a crowd of Filipinos at a rally.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Kwan/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Salvador Panelo, his lawyer, disputed that account, saying Mr. Duterte had not even discussed seeking asylum in China. “Why would Duterte escape?” he said. “At his age, he no longer cares about what is going to happen to him.”</p><p>In public, Mr. Duterte stuck to his usual bluster. At the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1157927139157346" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rally that Sunday</a>, he told a throng of mostly Filipino women that if being arrested by the I.C.C. was his fate in life, he would accept it. His allies made pronouncements that he would be back in the Philippines that Tuesday at 4:30 p.m.</p><p>It was a bluff.</p><p>Mr. Duterte’s group had booked five flights back to Manila that day to obfuscate their actual arrival. And there was a private jet waiting at the airport for Mr. Duterte, presumably to take him on to his stronghold of Davao in the south, said Police Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III and Antonio Trillanes, a former senator who <a href="https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2017/0606_trillanes1.asp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed a complaint against Mr. Duterte</a> with the I.C.C. in 2017. (Mr. Panelo, Mr. Duterte’s lawyer, denied this.)</p><p>Mr. Duterte landed around 9:30 a.m., hours before his camp had telegraphed. But he was detained soon after and, by the end of the day, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/asia/icc-philippines-rodrigo-duterte.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/asia/icc-philippines-rodrigo-duterte.html" title="">shipped off to The Hague</a>, where he is awaiting trial.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This account of that day, much of it previously unreported, is based on recollections from General Torre, Mr. Trillanes and Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, as well as public statements from Mr. Duterte and interviews with three of his allies.</p><p>It was perhaps the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/asia/duterte-arrest-international-criminal-court.html" title="">high-profile arrest</a> for the I.C.C. For the relatives of the tens of thousands of victims of Mr. Duterte’s drug war, it was, finally, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/asia/philippines-duterte-arrest-victims-justice.html" title="">tangible step toward justice</a>. And it is likely to define the presidency of the current leader, Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. Thousands of protesters have since accused Mr. Marcos of persecuting Mr. Duterte, his predecessor and onetime ally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters in Manila on March 11 demanding justice for people killed during Mr. Duterte’s bloody antidrug campaign.  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Earvin Perias/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The gravity of the day seemed clear to Mr. Marcos. “There is no reason to be happy,” Mr. Marcos told Mr. Remulla. “We shouldn’t celebrate.”</p><h2 id="link-6a716c1e">An 80-Page Plan</h2><p>Mr. Marcos was elected president in 2022, succeeding Mr. Duterte. He rose to power after forming an alliance with Sara Duterte, who won the race for vice president. Initially, he said that he would not cooperate with the I.C.C.’s investigation of Mr. Duterte’s drug war because his predecessor had withdrawn the Philippines from the court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But relations between Mr. Marcos and Ms. Duterte soured soon, and he changed course on the I.C.C. In 2024, the Philippine Congress started an inquiry into the former president’s war on drugs. But Mr. Duterte still seemed untouchable, years after he first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/07/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-drugs-killings.html" title="">condoned thousands of summary executions</a>.</p><p>Justice, many Filipinos hoped, would come from overseas. Mr. Marcos’s government was also expecting the I.C.C. to seek Mr. Duterte’s arrest. The Philippine police had prepared a secret 80-page plan called “Operation Pursuit” on how to detain Mr. Duterte. It included scenarios of arresting him in Manila or Davao, according to a copy that was viewed by The New York Times.</p><p> It also had maps of properties belonging to Mr. Duterte, his partner and his allies, with arrows labeling the nearby streets.</p><p>In The Hague, I.C.C. prosecutors <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/philippines" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">applied for a warrant</a> for Mr. Duterte on Feb. 10, accusing him of crimes against humanity. It was issued nearly <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/CourtRecords/0902ebd180aeb09d.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four weeks later</a> and the Philippine authorities received it via Interpol early on March 11. That cleared the way for Mr. Duterte’s detention because the Philippines was still a member of Interpol.</p><p>At about 9.30 a.m., Mr. Duterte landed in Manila on Cathay Pacific flight 907. Mr. Duterte, who often uses a cane, was waiting for his wheelchair when an official boarded the plane and told him that he would be arrested on an Interpol warrant on behalf of the I.C.C.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Duterte in custody at Villamor Air Base, in a photo released by an ally.

There he waited in the presidential lounge where he had once <a href="https://ph.usembassy.gov/u-s-secretary-of-state-pompeo-arrives-in-philippines-meets-with-president-duterte-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">greeted dignitaries</a> including former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.</p><p>Mr. Duterte’s lawyers tried to delay the reading of his rights so that he would not be taken into custody, and his wife refused for Mr. Duterte to get a checkup by a government doctor, according to General Torre.</p><p>After the police officer formally arrested him, Mr. Duterte said: “You will retire one day, and my children will go after you.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>About 90 minutes after Mr. Duterte had landed in Manila, Mr. Marcos’s office in Malacañang Palace announced the arrest.</p><p>But Mr. Duterte continued to argue that the I.C.C. had no jurisdiction in the Philippines.</p><p>“You should prosecute me in the Philippine courts, with a Filipino judge and a Filipino prosecutor,” Mr. Duterte told General Torre and other police officers, according to a video shared by his daughter Veronica Duterte. “You know this is politics.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers stood guard on March 11 outside Villamor Air Base in the Manila area, where Mr. Duterte was held until he was flown to the Netherlands.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ezra Acayan/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The government was racing to fly Mr. Duterte on a chartered flight to the Netherlands to avoid any possible civil unrest. </p><p>Mr. Duterte’s allies tried to get the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that his detention was illegal and unconstitutional. Their request was filed three minutes before the court closed for the day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-4d200610">International Obligations</h2><p>To outsiders, Mr. Duterte’s fate seemed unclear as the hours ticked by. Inside the lounge, Mr. Duterte sat on the presidential chair, the same one that Mr. Marcos uses now, and had rice and barbecued meat with a Coca-Cola.</p><p>In the meantime, the government was caught up in a bureaucratic nightmare. Officials needed to secure permission from other nations so the chartered plane could fly in their airspace en route to The Hague. Vietnam, the first country on their list, took three hours to respond. Another delay came because officials in Oman and the United Arab Emirates had shortened their working hours for Ramadan.</p><p>Mr. Duterte then asked to see Sara Duterte, the vice president, a request the authorities rejected. At around 9.40 p.m., Ms. Duterte turned up at the base, but guards turned her away. She told reporters there that her father’s arrest was a “state kidnapping.”</p><p>Inside, General Torre asked Mr. Duterte to move toward the plane. But Salvador Medialdea, Mr. Duterte’s former executive secretary, stepped between the two men, trying to physically shield the former president. General Torre then arrested Mr. Medialdea for obstruction of justice, handcuffing him personally, and sent him to the plane.</p><p>General Torre then turned to Mr. Duterte to say: “It is time. If I have to bodily carry you to the jet, I would.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Mr. Duterte complied. His daughter Veronica and his partner, Ms. Avanceña were in tears. Mr. Duterte and Ms. Avanceña hugged. At 11:03 p.m., he was in the air, accompanied by a retinue that included two doctors, a nurse, three police officers and Mr. Medialdea.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A chartered plane with Mr. Duterte aboard took off from Manila’s main airport on March 11, bound for the Netherlands.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ezra Acayan/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>About 15 minutes later, Mr. Marcos addressed the nation from Malacañang Palace on the banks of the Pasig River. He rejected the notion that Mr. Duterte’s arrest was political, saying, “This is what the international community expects of us as the leader of a democratic country that is part of the community of nations.”</p><p>After his speech, Mr. Marcos boarded his bulletproof boat to head back to his residence. The river was calm, and, behind him, the lights of the palace were twinkling.</p><p>Aie Balagtas See<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sui-lee-wee">More about Sui-Lee Wee</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
