Dennehy</a>, a veteran and highly-respected agent who has run the largest and most important field office in the bureau since last September.</p><p>An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on internal bureau communications.</p><p>The email came after the Justice Department ordered the F.B.I. on Friday to collect the names of bureau personnel who helped investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, raising the possibility that Mr. Trump’s political appointees plan to purge career bureau officials, including rank-and-file field agents. That number could reach 6,000 — or about a sixth of the bureau’s 38,000 employees, according to the F.B.I.</p><p>At least nine high-ranking officials have been forced out since Trump’s inauguration, plunging the bureau into confusion. Mr. Dennehy wrote that those removals had spread “fear and angst within the F.B.I. ranks.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Dennehy urged his employees to remain calm and to not make any rushed decisions about their careers as he committed to providing assistance to them no matter what happened.</p><p>“Time for me to dig in,” he wrote.</p><p>In an extraordinary gesture, Mr. Dennehy, a former Marine, praised the two top acting officials at the F.B.I. — Brian Driscoll and Robert C. Kissane — for “fighting” for the bureau’s employees. Both resisted efforts to immediately oust career employees, and pushed for a formal review process to delay or mitigate the disruption, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p>“They are warriors,” he said of the two men.</p><p>Such is the uncertainty at the F.B.I. that some bureau leaders have felt compelled to email colleagues to say they have not been removed.</p><p>“I know a lot of you have seen or heard reports that F.B.I. executives have been asked to resign or be fired,” the top agent in Seattle wrote on Friday. “To clarify my own status, as of this writing I have not been fired or asked to resign, nor have I received any indication I might be.”</p><p>On Saturday, the F.B.I. issued an extraordinary statement reassuring the work force that Mr. Driscoll was still the acting director. And Mr. Dennehy, in his email, also pushed back on rumors that anyone had been removed outside the small group of officials already known to have been ousted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I mourn the forced retirements,” he wrote, describing those who had left as “extraordinary individuals.”</p><p>Mr. Dennehy likened the current situation, spurred on by a president who has sought vengeance against anyone involved in his two federal criminal prosecutions and the Jan. 6 investigations, to his days as a Marine in the early 1990s — when he dug a small foxhole five feet deep in the ground and hunkered down for safety.</p><p>“It sucked,” he wrote. “But it worked.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.
