    <h1>Top F.B.I. Agent in New York Vows to ‘Dig In’ After Removals at Agency</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Dennehy urged his employees to remain calm and to not make any rushed decisions about their careers as he committed to providing assistance to them no matter what happened.</p><p>“Time for me to dig in,” he wrote.</p><p>In an extraordinary gesture, Mr. Dennehy, a former Marine, praised the two top acting officials at the F.B.I. — Brian Driscoll and Robert C. Kissane — for “fighting” for the bureau’s employees. Both resisted efforts to immediately oust career employees, and pushed for a formal review process to delay or mitigate the disruption, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p>“They are warriors,” he said of the two men.</p><p>Such is the uncertainty at the F.B.I. that some bureau leaders have felt compelled to email colleagues to say they have not been removed.</p><p>“I know a lot of you have seen or heard reports that F.B.I. executives have been asked to resign or be fired,” the top agent in Seattle wrote on Friday. “To clarify my own status, as of this writing I have not been fired or asked to resign, nor have I received any indication I might be.”</p><p>On Saturday, the F.B.I. issued an extraordinary statement reassuring the work force that Mr. Driscoll was still the acting director. And Mr. Dennehy, in his email, also pushed back on rumors that anyone had been removed outside the small group of officials already known to have been ousted.</p></div></div>
