Trump’s closing rally at Madison Square Garden on the second to last Sunday before the election was a release of rage at a political and legal system that impeached, indicted and convicted him, a vivid and at times racist display of the dark energy animating the MAGA movement.</p><p>A comic kicked off the rally by dismissing Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage,” then mocked Hispanics as failing to use birth control, Jews as cheap and Palestinians as rock-throwers, and called out a Black man in the audience with a reference to watermelon.</p><p>Another speaker likened Vice President Kamala Harris to a prostitute with “pimp handlers.” A third called her “the Antichrist.” And the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson mocked Ms. Harris — the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father — with a made-up ethnicity, saying she was vying to become “the first Samoan-Malaysian, low IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president.”</p><p>By the time the former president himself took the stage, an event billed as delivering the closing message of his campaign, with nine days left in a tossup race, had instead become a carnival of grievances, misogyny and racism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If the parade of speakers felt at times like a Republican National Convention reunion — Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Mr. Carlson, Vivek Ramaswamy, Alina Habba, Lee Greenwood, the Trump family all appeared — they seemed to have returned for a bonus fifth night that was more inflammatory than the original in July.</p><p>The rally served as a capstone to an escalating series of remarks from Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly said in recent days that one of the gravest threats that America faces is “the enemy within.” Democrats have cranked up warnings of Mr. Trump’s descent into authoritarianism as John F. Kelly, the former Marine general who was his longest-serving chief of staff, warned that Mr. Trump met the definition of a fascist.</p><p>“When I say ‘the enemy from within,’ the other side goes crazy,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday, mocking his critics.</p><p>Since early in his campaign, he has broadly promised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/trump-2024-president.html" title="">an era of “retribution”</a> if he wins. But after a relative lull earlier this year, he has grown more specific of late, including promising prosecutions against a variety of people if they’re deemed to have “cheated” in the election and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/trump-jack-smith.html" title="">fire the special counsel</a>, Jack Smith, who brought two federal indictments against him, and even suggesting throwing him out of the country entirely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Sunday, Mr. Trump described the date of his potential election as a “liberation day” from what he described as an occupation by invading migrants.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Long lines of supporters waited to enter the rally earlier on Sunday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Melania Trump, Mr. Trump’s wife, introduced her husband at the rally. Ms. Trump has not been a regular presence during this year’s campaign.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Harris’s campaign seized on the spectacle, and some Republicans, including from Florida and Puerto Rico, denounced the comic’s comments about the island. Several influential Puerto Rican superstars, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Luis Fonsi and Ricky Martin, lent their voice for Ms. Harris on Sunday.</p><p>But Mr. Trump has paid little political price over time for his own inflammatory remarks in the past — he has disparaged cities with large Black populations such as Detroit and Milwaukee this year — let alone those of his surrogates and supporters.</p><p>The marathon of speeches — Mr. Trump took the stage two hours after scheduled — was often infused with more self-indulgence than political strategy. Mr. Trump plainly enjoyed playing the Garden, which bills itself as “the world’s most famous arena.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Kamala, you’re fired!” Mr. Trump said, returning to the line that he first made famous as host of “The Apprentice.”</p><p>But he went so long that the crowd had begun to thin noticeably before he had finished his 78-minute speech.</p><p>The event was a spectacle that captured the unusual and sometimes ugly range of the MAGA movement that has taken over the Republican Party from the inside over the last nine years. </p><p>Hulk Hogan flexed his muscles and ripped off his clothes, just as he did at the convention. Donald Trump Jr. called his father a “badass.” The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who has poured $118 million of his fortune to aid Mr. Trump so far, entered to a video of his rocket booster landing, pumping his fists in the air. He promptly predicted the federal budget could be slashed by one-third even as Mr. Trump rolled out deficit-expanding tax breaks.</p><p>Stephen Miller, a senior Trump adviser who influenced Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant crackdown, used nativist language as he argued that only Mr. Trump would stand up and say “America is for Americans and Americans only.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The big surprise was a rare public speech by Melania Trump, who introduced her husband and exited the stage with him after he had finished, as the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.” blared.</p><p>The arrival of thousands of red hats at the symbolic arena at the center of a blue city in a blue state was celebrated by Trump supporters who relished the chance to collectively thumb their noses at the New York and national elite.</p><p>“Selling out the Garden means the MAGA movement has now arrived,” Jack Posobiec, the right-wing activist with a big following on social media, said in an interview. “It’s Madison Square Garden, it’s the center of everything, and to have this place filled with MAGA hats and Trump supporters really goes to show you it’s not just the surprise win of 2016 — it’s a nationwide movement.”</p><p>It was lost on no one that Mr. Trump was just miles from where he was convicted of 34 felony counts earlier this year and still awaiting sentencing, and a short jaunt to Trump Tower, where he opened his first presidential campaign in 2015.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Vivek Ramaswamy, Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida watching Senator JD Vance of Ohio speak at the rally on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump opened his speech by asking the crowd a timeworn political line: “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The singular nature of Mr. Trump’s candidacy was emblazoned in slogan form on the scoreboard above as he began to speak: “Trump will fix it.”</p><p>Mr. Trump opened by asking the crowd a timeworn political line: “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” It is at the core of Mr. Trump’s campaign against Ms. Harris ever since she replaced President Biden, a switch he remains sore about. Despite being delivered in a city that four years ago was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic and still deep in shutdowns and closed businesses, and swimming in a high death toll, that line landed well.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s vows of mass deportation and inveighing against undocumented immigrants had an audience in New York City, too, where thousands of migrants who crossed the southern border without authorization have been given sanctuary and some residents have complained about the use of city services to help them.</p><p>So many of the day’s warm-up speeches were spent portraying the former president as he wants to be seen. Several speakers talked about him surviving a July assassination attempt not in spiritual terms but in muscular ones, describing his toughness at “dodging” the bullet. Many also falsely claimed he “built” the skyline in a city in which he was always seen as a B-list developer with a small portfolio of buildings that he acquired long after they were constructed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The king of New York is back to reclaim the city that he built,” his son, Donald Trump Jr., declared anyway.</p><p>The elder Mr. Trump, who normally speaks only glowingly about his late father, Fred, from whom he inherited millions of dollars and the spine of his real-estate company, delivered a surprising line about his parents as he reflected on how they would be receiving word of his legal travails.</p><p>“I know my mother’s in heaven, I’m not 100 percent sure about my father, but it’s close,” Mr. Trump said, to laughter in the arena.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Outside the arena, an overflow crowd watched Mr. Vance speak as the sun fell over the city.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump was just miles from where he was convicted of 34 felony counts earlier this year and still awaiting sentencing, and a short jaunt to Trump Tower where he first began his 2016 presidential campaign.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It was all a surreal scene.</p><p>At one point, the painter Scott LoBaido received a huge cheer when he flipped a middle finger to the crowd before grabbing a paintbrush to paint an American flag as “America the Beautiful” boomed. The grand finale was revealing an image of Mr. Trump hugging the Empire State Building.</p><p>Later, the television host Phil McGraw, known as Dr. Phil, lectured the crowd on why Mr. Trump did not fit the definition of “a bully” because a bully requires “an imbalance of power,” seeming to ignore the fact that Mr. Trump has enormous power as a billionaire and former president.</p><p>During the speech by Mr. Trump’s running mate, Mr. Vance, the entire arena spontaneously burst into chants of “Tampon Tim” to disparage Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, Ms. Harris’s running mate.</p><p>“You all can say that,” Mr. Vance smiled. “I probably shouldn’t say that.”</p><p>It was a rare moment of restraint at the microphone.</p><p>David Rem, a childhood friend of Mr. Trump, called Ms. Harris “the devil.” Grant Cardone, a businessman, declared that the sitting vice president had “pimp handlers.” Sid Rosenberg denounced Hillary Clinton as a “sick son of a bitch” for linking the Trump rally and a pro-Nazi event at the arena of the same name decades ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Rosenberg called the entire Democratic Party “a bunch of degenerates, lowlives, Jew-haters and lowlives. Every one of them.”</p><p>When the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made his remark about Puerto Rico, there were groans from many in the audience.</p><p>On the same afternoon, Ms. Harris was in Philadelphia, courting Pennsylvania’s significant Latino population and stopping by Freddy &amp; Tony’s, a Puerto Rican restaurant.</p><p>“Timing is everything,” David Plouffe, a top Harris adviser, <a href="https://x.com/davidplouffe/status/1850654059499327938" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, posting clips of the two side-by-side.</p><p>In his White House bid, Mr. Trump has banked on winning uncommon shares of Black and Latino voters, in part by leaning into culture wars that split the Democratic Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In his speech, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. invoked his uncle, former Senator Ted Kennedy, for creating Title IX for women’s sports. He used that heritage to defend his own current opposition to transgender women participating in sports.</p><p>Mr. Carlson marveled aloud from the stage at following the party-switching Mr. Kennedy. “It’s a realignment,” he declared. “It’s unbelievable.”</p><p>Twenty years ago, in the same arena, Rudolph W. Giuliani delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Republican National Convention, three years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack prompted then-President George W. Bush to caution the nation against hate.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani leaned into overbroad stereotyping against the Palestinian people, who he said “are taught to kill us at two years old.”</p><p>“I don’t take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at 2,” he said. “I’m on the side of Israel.”</p><p>Mr. Giuliani praised Mr. Trump for coming to the city where he once served as Republican mayor.</p><p>“This is where a Republican is not supposed to come,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Which is why Donald Trump came here.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shane Goldmacher is a national political correspondent, covering the 2024 campaign and the major developments, trends and forces shaping American politics.
