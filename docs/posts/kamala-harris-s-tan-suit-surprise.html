Tim Walz, and their families.</p><p>And second, that she had popped up to speak (albeit briefly, and in praise of President Biden) while wearing a tan suit.</p><p>A tan suit!</p><p>After all, there are few garments less likely to show up at the public performances that are the major party presidential conventions. The usual dress code is one of straightforward red, white and blue: suits and ties, dresses, skirt suits. The point is patriotism in the most obvious sense.</p></div></div><div><p>The last time a tan suit made political waves, it was also late August, and the person wearing it was President <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/obama-wore-a-tan-suit-and-spoke-about-world-crises/" title="">Barack Obama</a>. The occasion was a news conference on Iraq and Syria, but the response from a large swath of the watching public was shock! horror! at the outfit. <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/obama-was-blasted-for-wearing-a-tan-suit-now-it-s-used-to-contrast-him-with-trump-20190828-p52lsy.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peter King</a>, the Republican congressman from New York, said he thought “the suit was a metaphor for his lack of seriousness.” <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/28/politics/barack-obama-tan-suit-fifth-anniversary/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lou Dobbs</a> of Fox called it “unpresidential.” It was such a sticky topic that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/18/the-full-transcript-from-obamas-final-news-conference/?itid=lk_inline_manual_30" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jokes</a> about the choice became part of Mr. Obama’s repertoire. They also became part of the late-night arsenal.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Barack Obama speaking at the White House in August 2014. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>None of which could have escaped Ms. Harris, for whom every detail of the most important convention of her political life will have been choreographed. If she was picking up the tan suit baton and running with it, there was most likely a reason.</p><p>Not surprisingly, commentators on social media jumped on the choice — the general interpretation being that Ms. Harris was subtly poking fun at past conservative horror over the tan suit. That she was using an otherwise conservative-seeming pantsuit to quietly underscore the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/arts/television/late-night-kamala-brat.html" title="">brat</a> side of her character.</p><p>“The troll game is strong,” one user <a href="https://www.threads.net/@ami.l.berger/post/C-33u2rskji" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on Threads.</p><p>“I yelled and then had to explain to my kid why the tan suit was an expert level choice for her,” another <a href="https://www.threads.net/@ami.l.berger/post/C-33u2rskji" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The suggestion that the suit, which came from the French label Chloé, designed by Chemena Kamali, whose gown Ms. Harris wore to the state dinner for Kenya, was a dig at her opponents may or may not be true, but it bolsters the narrative around Ms. Harris’s personality, her facility with memes and her general pop culture cred. It also serves to connect her historic candidacy — the first Black woman to become a major party nominee for president, the first woman of South Asian descent — to that of Mr. Obama, another historic figure.</p><p>And it worked as a sort of curtain-raiser and tone-setter for the convention. Ms. Harris needs to pace herself — to build to the moment of her acceptance speech — and wearing a tan suit was both a fairly innocuous opening choice and a sartorial next-stage moment; a break with the conventions of conventions. A choice that said something about a focus on individual stories, rather than group flag think.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hillary Clinton in cream-colored tweed and white trousers ...</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>... and Jill Biden in sequinned blue Ralph Lauren.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Harris was not the only speaker on Day 1 to take a personal approach to image-making. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/fashion/hillary-clinton-democratic-national-convention.html" title="">Hillary Clinton</a>’s cream tweed jacket and white trousers spoke directly to her own historic acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in 2016, when she wore a white pantsuit as a nod to the suffragist movement and started a movement. <a href="https://www.alamy.com/washington-dc-usa-23rd-sep-2022-president-joe-biden-kisses-first-lady-dr-jill-biden-before-elton-john-preforms-a-show-he-calls-a-night-when-hope-and-history-rhyme-as-part-of-his-farewell-tour-on-the-south-lawn-of-the-white-house-in-washington-dc-on-friday-september-23-2022-photo-by-bonnie-cashpoolabacapresscom-credit-abaca-pressalamy-live-news-image483761037.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jill Biden</a> last wore her gunmetal blue sequin Ralph Lauren dress in 2022 for a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/09/24/remarks-by-president-biden-and-first-lady-jill-biden-at-a-night-when-hope-and-history-rhyme-a-musical-performance-by-sir-elton-john-to-honor-everyday-history-makers/#:~:text=September%2024%2C%202022-,Remarks%20by%20President%20Biden%20and%20First%20Lady%20Jill%20Biden%20at,to%20Honor%20Everyday%20History%2DMakers&amp;text=THE%20FIRST%20LADY%3A%20Hello!,Good%20evening." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">White House event</a> named in honor of her husband’s favorite line from the poet Seamus Heaney, one he has repeated multiple times throughout his presidency: “when hope and history rhyme.”</p><p>Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota and the co-chair of the convention, who will become the first female Native American governor if Ms. Harris and Mr. Walz win the election, wore a dress and jacket by Jamie Okuma, an Indigenous designer. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/style/greene-crockett-insults-body-image.html" title="">Jasmine Crockett</a>, the representative from Texas who got into a verbal spat over appearance with Marjorie Taylor Greene during a committee meeting, showed up in an unapologetic black pantsuit piped in white, with a big brooch on the lapel.</p></div></div><div><p>None of the looks were standard political costumery. All of them acted as a frame and form of self-expression for people involved. The result was a little chaotic and kind of fun; a departure from the norm — and a contrast from the red, white and blue dressing that had been the standard at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/style/rnc-ear-bandages-melania-trump.html" title="">Republican convention in July</a>. As for Ms. Harris, the tan suit served one final purpose. Every time the camera panned to her sitting in her box smiling and waving at the crowd and the speakers, it triggered another frenzy of speculation about the choice. It was simply one more tool to center her in the conversation as a strategist without having to say another word.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota, spoke at the convention ...</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>.... as did Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Aug. 20, 2024</p><p>: </p><p><em>An earlier version of this article attributed an erroneous distinction to Lt.
