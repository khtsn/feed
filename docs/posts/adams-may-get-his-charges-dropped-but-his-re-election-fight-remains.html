    <h1>Adams May Get His Charges Dropped, but His Re-election Fight Remains</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Still, with the Justice Department pressuring federal prosecutors in Manhattan to drop the indictment against the mayor, just weeks after they said they had uncovered “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/nyregion/eric-adams-corruption-grand-jury.html" title="">additional criminal conduct</a>” by him, Mr. Adams may be freed from the prospect of having to sit through a heavily publicized April trial, only two months before the primary.</p><p>It was also unclear whether the request to drop Mr. Adams’s case might affect whether former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo enters the mayor’s race. Mr. Cuomo, who regularly leads mayoral polls even though he has not declared his candidacy, has typically drawn strong support from Black voters, placing him in direct competition with Mr. Adams.</p><p>More than a half-dozen candidates have entered the race. They include Brad Lander, the city comptroller; State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani; State Senator Zellnor Myrie; State Senator Jessica Ramos; and Scott Stringer, the former city comptroller. All are considered to the left of Mr. Adams.</p><p>Two other candidates are running as moderates: Jim Walden, a lawyer who is suing to run on the Independence Party ballot line, and Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund executive.</p></div></div>
