Andrew M. Cuomo enters the mayor’s race. Mr. Cuomo, who regularly leads mayoral polls even though he has not declared his candidacy, has typically drawn strong support from Black voters, placing him in direct competition with Mr. Adams.</p><p>More than a half-dozen candidates have entered the race. They include Brad Lander, the city comptroller; State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani; State Senator Zellnor Myrie; State Senator Jessica Ramos; and Scott Stringer, the former city comptroller. All are considered to the left of Mr. Adams.</p><p>Two other candidates are running as moderates: Jim Walden, a lawyer who is suing to run on the Independence Party ballot line, and Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund executive.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
