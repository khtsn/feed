Damage and injuries were also reported elsewhere in Ukraine, as the country declared a day of mourning for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/ukraine-russia-strike-zelensky-hometown.html" title="">a deadly strike on Friday</a> in the city of Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A missile strike on a residential neighborhood there killed 19 people, including nine children, and wounded 74 others. It damaged the courtyard of an apartment block, and emergency medical workers found some of the wounded in a playground, videos released by Ukraine’s emergency services showed.

Putin of Russia of playing for time in cease-fire negotiations mediated by the Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While Ukraine agreed last month to accept an unconditional 30-day halt in the fighting, Russia did not. Both sides have agreed in principle to temporarily halt strikes against energy infrastructure, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/europe/russia-ukraine-power-energy-grid.html" title="">only to accuse each other</a> of violating the agreement. Kyiv and Moscow also committed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-deal-black-sea.html" title="">a cease-fire on the Black Sea</a> last month in separate U.S.-mediated talks — but are still negotiating whether or how it will come into force.</p><p>Ukrainian officials say that, as the talks continue, Russia has shifted tactics in the missile and drone war by increasing the overall number of exploding drones and singling out certain cities for intense bombardments on some nights, rather than scattering attacks around the country.</p><p>The Ukrainian Air Force said on March 30 that 4,133 drones and missiles were fired that month, an increase from earlier months.</p><p>In Sunday’s attack, the air force said, Russia launched a mix of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones.</p><p>In Kyiv, the aerial assault began with exploding drones. Missiles then followed, setting off air-raid alarms through the night and early morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Valentyn Maidaniuk, a Kyiv resident, said he saw explosions flashing in the sky and heard buzzing from the drones’ engines as he walked to an air-raid shelter early Sunday.
