But taken together, they will amount to a sharp turn in direction after the Biden administration, an effort to begin to make good on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-president-promises.html" title="">his campaign promises</a> and initial steps toward breaking what he and his aides see as a “deep state” effort to thwart his agenda.</p><p>Top advisers briefed reporters on many of them. Here are some of the major elements.</p><h3 id="link-3b046867"><span>Immigration and the Border</span></h3><ul><li><p>Close the border to asylum-seeking migrants. </p></li><li><p>Declare an end to birthright citizenship, a guarantee granted by the 14th Amendment, for the children of undocumented immigrants. The president cannot change the Constitution on his own, so it’s not yet clear how Trump plans to withhold the benefits of citizenship to a group of people born in the United States. The move is all but certain to be challenge in court.</p></li><li><p>Involve the U.S. military in border security. This would draw immediate legal challenges because of the strict limits in American law for how the armed forces can be deployed inside the country.</p></li><li><p>Declare migrant crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border to be a national emergency, which would allow Mr. Trump to unilaterally unlock federal funding for border wall construction, without approval from Congress, for stricter enforcement efforts. </p></li><li><p>Designate drug cartels as “global terrorists.” </p></li></ul><h3 id="link-ffb225d"><span>Federal Work Force</span></h3><ul><li><p>End remote work policies and order many agencies back to the office 4-5 days a week.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-4db68d53"><span>Gender and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Initiatives</span></h3><ul><li><p>Establish biological sex definitions for federal workers and as part of revised Title IX guidance to schools</p></li><li><p>Remove protections for transgender people in federal prisons.</p></li><li><p>Remove protections for transgender migrants in U.S. custody.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-124b2b8"><span>Tariffs and Trade</span></h3><ul><li><p>Direct federal agencies to begin an investigation into trade practices, including trade deficits, unfair currency practices, counterfeit goods and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/business/economy/tariffs-amazon-walmart-china-shein.html" title="">a special exemption</a> that allows low-value goods to come into the United States tariff free.</p></li><li><p>Assess China’s compliance with a trade deal Mr. Trump signed in 2020, as well as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump signed in 2020 to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p></li><li><p>Order the government to assess the feasibility of creating an “External Revenue Service” to collect tariffs and duties.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-6cd31e6c"><span>Energy and the Environment</span></h3><ul><li><p>Declare a national energy emergency, which could allow him to unlock powers to speed permitting for pipelines and power plants.</p></li><li><p>Order the federal government to roll back regulations that impede domestic energy production.</p></li><li><p>Signal an intention to loosen the limits on tailpipe pollution and fuel economy standards, which Mr. Trump refers to as an “electric vehicle mandate.”</p></li><li><p>Roll back energy-efficiency regulations for dishwashers, shower heads and gas stoves.</p></li><li><p>Open the Alaska wilderness to more oil and gas drilling.</p></li><li><p>Eliminate environmental justice programs across the government, which are aimed at protecting poor communities from excess pollution.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-32284d46"><span>Delaying the ban on TikTok</span></h3><p>Mr. Trump vowed early Sunday to issue an executive order to give ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese owner, more time to make a sale and satisfy a law that would ban it in the United States. The incoming White House officials previewing Mr. Trump’s executive actions on Monday did not address any executive action on the app.</p><p>Erica L.
