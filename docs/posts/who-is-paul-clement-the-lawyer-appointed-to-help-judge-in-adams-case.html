    <h1>Who Is Paul Clement, the Lawyer Appointed to Help Judge in Adams Case?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2016, Mr. Clement <a href="https://www.lawdragon.com/press-releases/2016-09-15-paul-clement-bancroft-partners-join-kirkland-ellis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joined the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis</a>, and in 2020, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/trump-supreme-court-nominees-list.html" title="">was floated</a> as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court by President Trump after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p><p>After the court in 2022 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/business/dealbook/gun-restrictions-corporate-america.html" title="">struck down</a> a New York law that restricted concealed weapons, Kirkland &amp; Ellis said it would no longer defend cases involving the Second Amendment. Mr. Clement left to start a boutique firm that would continue that work, among other cases.</p><p>Mr. Clement attended Georgetown University for his undergraduate studies, before receiving a law degree from Harvard University in 1992. After law school, he clerked for Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and then on the Supreme Court for Justice Antonin Scalia.</p><p>On Friday, Judge Dale E. Ho delayed a ruling on a Justice Department request to drop the corruption case against Mr. Adams, instead appointing Mr. Clement to present independent arguments on the motion, which was otherwise unopposed.</p></div></div>
