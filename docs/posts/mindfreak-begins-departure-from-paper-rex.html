    <h1>mindfreak begins departure from Paper Rex</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
			<p>There is absolutely a possibility Monyet could be dropped. We may regard EWC as a less serious tournament compared to Masters or Champs, but it is still a tournament for them to base player performance. Dropping crazyguy means losing an IGL and a player who can play the flex/flash-initiator role. Monyet is great on duelist and I think that could be a reason to keep him - embracing double duelist - but mindfreak&#39;s agent pool is closer to Monyet&#39;s as a direct replacement.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a completely different possibility of mindfreak joining BOOM if BOOM stay up this year. Dos9 is great, but you could easily drop him to go full Indo and allow for smoother comms.</p>		</div></div>
