</span> has <a href="https://x.com/pprxteam/status/1944698472831266838" target="_blank">moved</a> <span data-ref-id="1">Aaron		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9800/mindfreak">mindfreak</a>&#34;
		Leonhart</span> to the reserve roster, allowing him to explore offers outside the team as a restricted free-agent.</p>

<p>Both parties have indicated that this change was mindfreak&#39;s decision. Still hungry to play and grow as a competitor, he has <a href="https://x.com/aaronleonhart4/status/1944699050235957343" target="_blank">expressed</a> his desire to join a new team after Stage 2. </p>

<p>mindfreak has been the Controller player for Paper Rex since the organization&#39;s Valorant debut in 2021. His time with the org starts even earlier than that, as he was originally part of the Counter Strike team alongside <span data-ref-id="2">

		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span>, <span data-ref-id="3">

</span>, and <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9802/benkai">
		Benkai	</a>
</span>. Since then, mindfreak has been a part of all of Paper Rex&#39;s ups and downs throughout the years, suffering through both of their grand finals defeats at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1014/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-copenhagen" target="_blank">Masters Copenhagen</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1657/valorant-champions-2023" target="_blank">Champions 2023</a>. In 2025, Paper Rex hit a hard slump, and needed to make a change to get the gears turning again. Unfortunately for mindfreak, that meant that he lost his place on the starting roster for the newcomer <span data-ref-id="5">

		PatMen	</a>
</span>.</p>

<p>While mindfreak wasn&#39;t playing on stage for Paper Rex&#39;s legendary train ride through Toronto, he still played a role in their success. Moving to the assistant coaching role, he coached his teammates in the Controller role, and helped PatMen integrate into the team. His praise was sung in interviews and his impact was shown in behind-the-scenes content. At last, Paper Rex and mindfreak became Masters winners, as their third grand finals appearance finally yielded victory at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>.</p>
