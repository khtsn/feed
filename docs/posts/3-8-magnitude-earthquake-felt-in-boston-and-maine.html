There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.</p><p>According to the survey’s <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/at00sqr6q8/shakemap/intensity" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">self-reporting tool</a>, people reported feeling shaking in Providence, about 100 miles southwest of the epicenter, and Augusta, Me., about 90 miles away.</p><p>The Maine Emergency Management Agency <a href="https://x.com/MaineEMA/status/1883908069710786917" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that the earthquake occurred at 10:22 a.m. As seismologists review available data, they may revise the earthquake’s reported magnitude.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The morning shake caught many New Englanders off guard.</p><p>Joe Watts, the chief executive of <a href="https://starisland.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Star Island</a>, a summer community and conference center just off the coast of New Hampshire, said he thought the boiler in his Portsmouth, N.H., office had exploded at first. A friend on the phone with him at the time of the earthquake described it as a truck driving into a building.</p><p>The tremors lasted for about 10 seconds, he said.</p><p>“We’re probably wimps compared to people in the Bay Area,” he said. But for this quiet corner of New England, “it was a big deal,” he said.</p><p>Jane Sweeney, an activities assistant at a senior living community in Rye, N.H., seven miles south of Portsmouth, said she had just finished setting up for an art class around 10:30 a.m. when the floor and walls of the building began rocking so noticeably, she thought that the oil burner may have exploded in the basement.</p><p>“It was pretty scary — it really shook me up — and I ran to check on the residents,” she said. “Everyone was coming out of their rooms. It’s not something we’re used to experiencing here.”</p><p>Jenna Russell<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
