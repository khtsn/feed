It also wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion. A period of turmoil followed, with executive turnover and, eventually, a breakup of the company, into the services-focused Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the hardware specialist HP Inc.</p><p>In 2015, the company sued Mr. Lynch and Autonomy’s former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, in London, seeking 5 billion pounds ($6.5 billion) in damages. Both men denied the allegations, and the two sides fought in court for years, in what the presiding judge, Robert Hildyard, called “amongst the longest and most complex in English legal history.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 2022, Judge Hildyard ruled largely in the company’s favor. In February, lawyers for Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Mr. Lynch argued in court about the amount of the damages.
