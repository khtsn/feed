    <h1>Dozens of House Republicans Defy Trump’s Orders to Support Spending Bill</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several did so because they opposed the idea of raising the debt limit for more than two years, something they argue would allow out-of-control government spending to continue unabated. Mr. Trump had argued that raising the limit would clear the decks for his ambitious legislative agenda, removing a potential fight over the issue early in his term.</p><p>For the president-elect, the actions of his party on Thursday night raise questions as he moves into the final act of his political career: Have the signs suggesting his grip over the G.O.P. is tighter than ever been wrong? Has he lost some control he once had? Or was the vote merely a brief hiccup in the absolute loyalty forecast for when he moves back into the White House next month?</p><p>The answer may not be known until Mr. Trump puts a razor-thin Republican majority to the test next year. It will only take a handful of Republicans to doom any one of his agenda items in the House or the Senate. But such defiance would come at the risk of their political careers, under a president who has shown himself willing and able to rally voters as he wishes.</p><p>Still, the rebel Republicans who voted against his wishes on Thursday did so despite an explicit electoral threat. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump had warned that “any Republican that would be so stupid” as to vote against a bill like the one offered on Thursday “should, and will,” face primary challenges. More than three dozen House members were not dissuaded.</p></div></div>
