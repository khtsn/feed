He is not eligible for parole.</p><p>In reading the sentence, Judge Victoria A. Rossetti of Lake County Circuit Court called Mr. Crimo “irretrievably depraved,” a man who has demonstrated no remorse for his crimes.</p><p>“No sentence can ever change the events of July 4,” she said. “Nor can it compensate for the loss of a loved one or injured.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>About two dozen relatives of the victims gathered in the courtroom gallery to hear the sentence. Some of them sobbed; others leaned their heads on their relatives’ shoulders for support.</p><p>Mr. Crimo avoided a trial in the case by pleading guilty in March to 69 criminal counts, including first-degree murder.</p><p>During the two-day sentencing hearing that began Wednesday morning, witnesses recounted the terror and chaos of the shooting in Highland Park, Ill., recalling how they fled with their families and saw people lying bloodied in the street.</p><p>In remarks to the court, Eric Rinehart, the Lake County state’s attorney, described a community that was shattered. Mr. Crimo created “an ocean of grief, pain, heartache and loss,” he said. “Many believe that the sentence you give cannot redress this.”</p><p>Gregory Ticsay, a lawyer for Mr. Crimo, said in court on Thursday that Mr. Crimo had resigned himself to a life sentence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“He has pleaded guilty with the understanding that he will spend the rest of his life in prison,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Crimo, who is being held in the Lake County jail, refused to appear at the hearing all day Wednesday and again on Thursday. Judge Rossetti said that the sentencing would go on without him.</p><p>“He was told if he did not appear, we could proceed in his absence, including the sentencing, so we will proceed,” Judge Rossetti said on Thursday.</p><p>Erica Weeder, who was wounded by shrapnel during the shooting, spoke in court on Thursday about the lasting effects that the shooting had on her psyche.</p><p>Now, she said, she is bothered by fireworks, by the loud noises of construction sites, by the rumble of the L train.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I lost some of my deep keel,” she said. “Some of my ability to bounce back from stressful events is simply gone.”</p><p>Killed in the shooting were Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Irina McCarthy, 35, and her husband, Kevin McCarthy, 37.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times, writing and reporting stories from around the Midwest.</p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
