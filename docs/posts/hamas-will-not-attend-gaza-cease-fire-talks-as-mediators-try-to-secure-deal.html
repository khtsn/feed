they raced to lock down an elusive cease-fire in the Gaza Strip that could defuse tensions ahead of an anticipated attack on Israel by Iran and Hezbollah.</p><p>The cease-fire talks, which are set to take place in Doha, Qatar, or Cairo, were expected to include top intelligence officials from Egypt, Israel and the United States, as well as the Qatari prime minister. </p><p>But as of Tuesday, Hamas representatives were not planning to take part. Ahmad Abdul-Hadi, a Hamas representative in Lebanon, said in an interview that doing so would mean going “backward to square one,” and accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel of dragging out the negotiations.</p><p>“Netanyahu is not interested in reaching an agreement that ends the aggression completely, but rather he is deceiving and evading and wants to prolong the war, and even expand it at the regional level,” Mr. Abdul-Hadi said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Hamas’s decision did not appear to bode well for a breakthrough on Thursday, but it did not mean the group had completely left the bargaining table.</p><p>Hamas leaders have not met directly with Israeli officials throughout the war, relying on Qatar and Egypt to act as intermediaries. And many of Hamas’s most senior political leaders are based in Qatar, a short drive from the offices of Qatari mediators in Doha.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourners at a funeral in Israel on Tuesday  for a soldier killed in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Levy/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Two officials briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, said that Hamas would still be willing to engage with mediators after the meeting if Israel put forward a “serious response” to Hamas’s latest offer, from early July.</p><p>A State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said that Qatari officials had assured the United States they would work to have Hamas represented at the talks, though he did not say if members of the group would attend in person or would be represented only by intermediaries.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“We fully expect these talks to move forward,” Mr. Patel said.</p><p>Asked on Tuesday about the potential for a cease-fire deal, President Biden told reporters that “It’s getting harder” but that he was “not giving up.”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has rejected accusations that he is stonewalling and has accused Hamas of thwarting a deal to stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages who were seized during the attack it led on Israel on Oct. 7. But Mr. Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">added new conditions</a> to Israel’s demands that his own negotiators fear have created obstacles to a deal, according to unpublished documents reviewed by The New York Times. His office said he was simply clarifying ambiguities.</p><p>While Hamas has said a cease-fire agreement should include an end to the war and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu has said that Israel will not stop fighting until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed.</p><p>Last Thursday, Mr. Biden, along with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar, declared that “the time has come” for a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.</p><p>“There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,” the leaders said in a joint statement. They said they were willing to present a “final bridging proposal” to close a deal between Israel and Hamas.</p></div></div><div><div><p>At a news conference on Tuesday in Washington, Mr. Patel said that the United States was “so clearly committed to this because we think it is in the vital interests of the region.” A cease-fire could create the conditions necessary to “get the region out of this endless cycle of violence,” he said.</p><p>Tensions in the Middle East have been running high since Hamas’s political leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-dead.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, was killed in an explosion while he was visiting Tehran on July 31, just hours after a senior Hezbollah commander, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/01/world/israel-hamas-iran-haniyeh-gaza" title="">Fuad Shukr</a>, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A funeral ceremony for Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Iran has vowed to retaliate for the assassination on its soil. Israel has not acknowledged that it was behind the explosion, but U.S. officials have privately assessed that it was. Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia backed by Iran that has been trading fire with Israel for months, has promised to avenge Mr. Shukr’s death.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has promised to “exact a heavy price for any act of aggression against us, from any quarter.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>American and European leaders have urged Iran not to retaliate, warning that an attack could set of a broader regional war. But Iran has insisted it has the right to defend its sovereignty.</p><p>On Tuesday, Nasser Kanani, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, said that Britain, France and Germany, in issuing a joint statement calling on Iran to exercise restraint, had ignored Israeli attacks in the region.</p><p>“The Islamic Republic of Iran is firm and resolute in defending its sovereignty and national security, as well as helping to establish lasting stability in the region and creating deterrence against the real origin and main source of insecurity and terrorism in the region,” Mr. Kanani said in a statement.</p><p>Iran, he said, “won’t ask for permission from anyone to use its established rights.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Michael Levenson covers breaking news for The Times from New York.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-levenson">More about Michael Levenson</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Cease-Fire Negotiators Gather Ahead of Expected Attack by Iran<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">Israel-Hamas War News</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Iranian Vice President Resigns: </strong>As Iran’s former foreign minister, its most seasoned foreign policy expert and the top negotiator in the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/middleeast/iran-cabinet-zarif-resignation.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-middle-east-crisis&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Mohammad Javad Zarif has bowed out</a> as a possible regional war looms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Clashes With Defense Minister:</strong> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, of embracing an “anti-Israel narrative” in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/middleeast/netanyahu-gallant-israel-gaza-war.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-middle-east-crisis&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">disagreement over how to prosecute the war in Gaza</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why Iran Has Waited to Retaliate:</strong> Tehran is under pressure to avenge the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, but analysts said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-retaliation-attack-explained.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-middle-east-crisis&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">it is balancing multiple factors</a> as it weighs a response.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel Criticized After Strike:</strong> An Israeli airstrike on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-strike-school.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-middle-east-crisis&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">school turned shelter in northern Gaza</a> that local officials said killed dozens of people drew strong condemnation.
