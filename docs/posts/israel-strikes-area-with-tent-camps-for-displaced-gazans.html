While many Gazans hoped they would be safe in the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone, Israel has occasionally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/middleeast/israel-strike-gaza-al-mawasi.html" title="">struck</a> there, citing activity by militants.</p><p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Mawasi attack and did not confirm the location of the strike.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mustafa Abutaha, an English teacher sheltering in Mawasi, said he hoped Hamas reached a deal with Israel as soon as possible to end the war. Otherwise, he said, he feared Israel would fully take over Gaza.</p><p>“Every day there’s bombardment, nonstop,” said Mr. Abutaha, reached by phone. “We live in terrible conditions, and the saddest thing is that people have almost gotten used to it.”</p><p>Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/middleeast/israel-threatens-gaza-escalation.html" title="">vowed to intensify its attacks</a> in Gaza in an effort to force Hamas to lay down its weapons and to release the hostages seized by the armed group in the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people, saw about 250 taken hostage and touched off the war.</p><p>In January, Israel and Hamas signed a cease-fire that mediators hoped would lead to an end to the war. Thirty hostages and about 1,500 Palestinian prisoners were freed before Israel ended the truce in mid-March with a renewed military assault in Gaza, citing a deadlock in talks to secure the next steps of the deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourners at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The Israeli offensive came as Palestinians face what the United Nations has <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-280-gaza-strip" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> could be the worst humanitarian crisis since the war began. More than 400,000 people have been displaced by the renewed fighting, many after returning to their homes for the first time in months.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Since early March, Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-block.html" title="">blocked the entry of humanitarian aid</a> into the Palestinian enclave, barring shipments of medicine and food. Israeli officials have argued they allowed in sufficient supplies during the cease-fire but that Hamas has diverted some of the aid for its own purposes.</p><p>Many Israelis remain deeply anxious over the fate of the dozens of hostages still held by Hamas and allied groups. About 59 of the captives seized in the Oct. 7 attack are still in the enclave, more than half of them now presumed dead.</p><p>Israeli leaders have vowed to destroy Hamas in addition to freeing the hostages. But many Israelis say their government cannot do both at once and should agree to terms to free the captives — even if it means ending the war with Hamas’s rule intact.</p><p>International mediators — including from the Trump administration — have sought to broker a new deal between Israel and Hamas to restore the cease-fire and free the remaining hostages. But neither side has yet to compromise on their seemingly irreconcilable demands.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Hamas has blamed Israel for the ongoing war, arguing that the group is ready to free all the hostages as part of a deal to end it. But ordinary Gazans are increasingly denouncing the armed group for refusing to compromise to end the fighting.</p><p>Thousands of Palestinians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/middleeast/gaza-protests-hamas.html" title="">have joined protests</a> against Hamas’s control over the past few weeks, calling for the group to leave power and for an end to the war. Public expressions of dissent under Hamas’s repressive rule have been rare because of the high price of speaking out in Gaza, where rights groups say opponents have been regularly jailed and tortured.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
