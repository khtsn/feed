He said that Britain had “no plans” to agree a mobility scheme — of the type favored by Germany — that would help young Britons and their European counterparts cross the channel to work, though he did not rule out that prospect when asked later by reporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Britain’s 2016 referendum, in which the country voted by a narrow majority to leave the European Union, plunged it into a sustained political crisis and raised tensions with its member states. In the years that followed, fractious Brexit negotiations under the pugilistic prime minister Boris Johnson torched ties with many European capitals. His short-lived successor, Liz Truss, once pointedly refused to say whether the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was a friend or enemy.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>So the first phase of Mr. Starmer’s re-engagement with European leaders is simply to be pleasant to them, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute. “This is all about mood music, rebuilding trust, restoring confidence, being nice to people, being polite and showing that we have changed — which sounds obvious but is really important,” he said.</p><p>While the charm offensive was going “very well indeed,” Mr. Grant said that agreeing to specific changes would be much harder for Mr. Starmer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Scholz, a fellow center-left politician, gave Mr. Starmer a cordial welcome, describing Germany and Britain as “good friends, close partners and trusted allies.” He said that the planned treaty was “grounded in a new spirit of cooperation,” and that Germany wanted “to take the hand that has reached out to us.”</p><p>But he also expressed his desire for more freedom of movement for young people, noting that “contacts between our societies, between Germans and people in the U.K., have declined massively after Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic — we want to change that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Scholz, left, described Germany and Britain as “good friends, close partners and trusted allies.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ebrahim Noroozi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Starmer, who said he wanted to “turn a corner on Brexit,” later flew to Paris, where he planned to attend the Paralympics opening ceremony and meet Mr. Macron, with whom he also has a strong rapport.</p><p>Before becoming prime minister, Mr. Starmer once campaigned to overturn Brexit, but he later abandoned that stance and ruled out a significant rethink.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still, he hopes to improve the terms of a minimalist trade and cooperation agreement that was struck with the European Union by Mr. Johnson.</p><p>While Berlin might be able to offer Britain limited measures to improve economic cooperation, Germany’s trade policy is dictated by its membership of the European Union.</p><p>Any significant changes would have to be agreed not in Berlin, but in Brussels.</p><p>Mr. Starmer may try enlisting Mr. Scholz’s help in changing that. But in Berlin the main focus was on improving defense and security ties. Concerns about America’s commitment to Ukraine if Donald J. Trump wins the presidential election have underscored the importance to Germany of boosting defense cooperation. A key pillar of the new treaty with Britain, the German government said in a statement, would be to strengthen “the links between our defense communities, industries and armed forces.”</p><p>Britain’s push to improve economic ties with the European Union will likely have to wait until the fall, when a new team is in place at the bloc’s main executive body, the European Commission.</p><p>Mr. Starmer has already said that he wants to improve trade in food, animal and plant products that have been tied up in post-Brexit bureaucracy. In exchange, Britain would have to accept some European veterinary safety standards.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Grant said that to win trade concessions, Britain would have to engage with key European demands, including a comprehensive agreement on fishing rights, a deal to help young people move more freely across the continent, and Erasmus, a student exchange program that Britain quit as part of Brexit.</p><p>A youth mobility scheme could be politically sensitive in Britain, where legal immigration increased rapidly after Brexit. But the government’s objections to rejoining Erasmus relates to financial pressures, Mr. Grant said. Estimates suggest it could cost the country 2 billion pounds, or $2.6 billion, over seven years.</p><p>“Changing the nitty-gritty will be much more difficult because Britain is going to have to bite the bullet and do some of the things the E.U. wants it to do,” Mr. Grant said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
