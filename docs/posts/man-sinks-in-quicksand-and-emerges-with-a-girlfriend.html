But that didn’t make it any less scary when Mitchell O’Brien slowly began to sink.</p><p>Mr. O’Brien was on Van’s Beach on the northeastern shore of Lake Michigan with his friend Breanne Sika last weekend hunting for Leland bluestones, a byproduct of the iron ore furnaces that operated in the nearby fishing village that attract rock hunters.</p><p>Some dredging had been taking place on the beach, and Mr. O’Brien, 37, from Traverse City, Mich., said he had thought the sand felt unstable.</p><p>“‘That looks really dangerous,’” he recalled Ms. Sika saying. “I turned around and ended up walking right to the spot she said was dangerous.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I got my one foot stuck because I was trying to get my electronics out of my pocket. I knew not to panic. I have to be a macho man. You can’t ask for help when you’re trying to impress the girl you’re with.”</p><p>Soon enough, Mr. O’Brien was waist-deep in the sand. He urged Ms. Sika to take photographs, “or no one will believe us.”</p><p>After 15 minutes or so trying to pull him out, the two began calling 911. They were hampered by spotty cellphone service, and the sound of the breaking waves made it hard for Mr. O’Brien to be heard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. O’Brien and Breanne Sika were looking for bluestones on the beach.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mitchell O’Brien</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. O’Brien called 911.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Breanne Sika</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>When Mr. O’Brien finally connected, “I said to the 911 operator, ‘I think my girlfriend is also trying to call.’ At the same moment she was saying, ‘My boyfriend is stuck.’”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That was a moment. Though they had talked about the possibility of a relationship, it was the first time they had referred to each other with those words.</p><p>Mr. O’Brien is a recovery coach and has been in recovery from alcoholism for four years. Ms. Sika, 36, also works in the recovery industry.</p><p>As they waited for emergency personnel to arrive, Mr. O’Brien said he had remained calm. He was pretty sure he wasn’t going to sink all the way under the sand, like in a Looney Tunes scene. “As soon as my foot got stuck it hit bottom; it felt like cement,” he said.</p><p>As it happens, drowning in quicksand in real life is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/how-deadly-is-quicksand" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly impossible</a>, scientists say. Sand is denser than the human body, so even if one’s legs sink, the air in the lungs keeps the body too buoyant to go all the way under.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The newly official boyfriend and girlfriend.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Breanne Sika</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Still, Mr. O’Brien wasn’t budging. He tried to dig himself out, but the waves kept returning the sand he had scooped away. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Four firefighters soon arrived. They gave Mr. O’Brien a lifejacket, put a rope around him and pulled. One firefighter joined him in the muck, being careful not to fall in himself.</p><p>“Between them pulling, him pushing and me crawling, I got out,” Mr. O’Brien said. It took about 10 minutes.</p><p>Dan Besson, the Leland Township Fire and Rescue chief, told MLive that the city was posting cautionary signage at the beach to warn people about the dredging outwash. “It’s the first time we’ve had an issue,” <a href="https://www.mlive.com/environment/2025/04/quicksand-swallows-man-at-michigan-beach-near-harbor-dredging.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>.</p><p>Mr. O’Brien’s ordeal might not have been as dramatic as the scene in “The Princess Bride,” when Buttercup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8Fsyld7YD0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sinks instantly</a> in sand in the Fire Swamp and Westley dives in headfirst to rescue her. But there was still romance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. O’Brien said that he and Ms. Sika had been “really good friends” before the beach visit, but that for a long time “neither of us knew that we were interested in each other.”</p><p>Something about sinking in quicksand seemed to concentrate the mind wonderfully, and now they are official.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
