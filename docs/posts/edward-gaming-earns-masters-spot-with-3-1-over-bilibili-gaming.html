</span> 3-1 in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598950/bilibili-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lbf" target="_blank">lower final</a>, completing a four-win lower bracket run and taking the last <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a> spot in China.</p>

<p>The series opened on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598950/bilibili-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lbf/?game=245289&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>. EDG played a relentless defense in the first half as their two Duelists pushed forward searching for picks nearly every round. The approach produced mixed results, the game alternating between BLG punishing them and <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> raking in multikills for a 6-6 half. </p>

<p>Despite ZmjjKK continuing to pop off in the second half, BLG&#39;s defense was convincing as they shut EDG out of the bombsites, <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3021/biank">
		Biank	</a>
</span> capping things off 13-9 with an oppressive Odin 4K. ZmjjKK finished the map at 26 kills and seven first bloods, while <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/10698/nephh">
		nephh	</a>
</span> had the most kills for BLG with 22. </p>

<p><em>Biank spams down four with the Odin to finish Pearl.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598950/bilibili-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lbf/?game=245290&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a> was the next map. BLG had a strong 6-1 start on their defense off the back of a bonus round conversion and a clever anti-Neon tripwire on A, but <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/39697/cb">

</span> on Neon and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> on Omen began to find openings in the rounds after to equalize 6-6.</p>

<p>The second half stayed close as the score creeped up to 8-8 and then 10-10. EDG distinguished themselves in the final few rounds with proactive Mid fights, closing out the map 13-10.</p>

<p>Last time the two teams faced off on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598950/bilibili-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lbf/?game=245291&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a> in the middle bracket, BLG won a one-sided 13-7. After only getting one defense round last time, EDG learned from their mistakes, exploiting the gaps in BLG&#39;s utility-heavy Breach-Tejo site executes to deliver a much closer 6-6 half.</p>

<p>A vintage ZmjjKK Jett performance was the critical difference-maker. The Duelist popped off with 30 kills, eight first bloods, and 228 ADR, forcing open the sites and spurring on his team to a 13-10 win.</p>

<p><em>ZmjjKK pries open B with a 3K.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598950/bilibili-gaming-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lbf/?game=253654&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a> was the most dominant map of the series. After BLG won the bonus to lead 4-0, EDG won seven consecutive attacking rounds, finding repeated success on A to go up 7-5 at the half. The nail in the coffin was round 15; <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> combined for all five kills with only Sheriffs in the bonus round, giving EDG an 11-5 lead that they converted to a 13-6 victory. </p>

<p><em>Sharp shots from nobody and CHICHOO lock down the site.</em></p>

<p>nobody was the clear statistical leader on Split with 19 kills to only eight deaths as Fade. As for the series, ZmjjKK&#39;s numbers spoke for themselves as he put up an 89/61/13 KDA equalling a +28 kill differential along with a whopping 22 first kills.</p>

<p>EDG now looks forward to their tenth international event as they seek to re-establish their status as a global contender. On the other side, BLG will go home in a respectable but heartbreaking fourth place after playing both of their qualification matches without their full roster. </p>
