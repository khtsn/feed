    <h1>Trump Delayed Tariffs Against Canada and Mexico</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada struck last-minute deals today to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/03/us/trump-tariffs" title="">postpone hefty tariffs that the U.S. planned to impose tomorrow</a> on goods from the two countries. The agreements temporarily averted a North American trade war.</p><p>Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced this afternoon that Trump had agreed to postpone tariffs against Canada for 30 days as the two countries negotiate a border deal. Hours earlier, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico announced a similar pause after agreeing to a series of U.S. demands on border security, including a promise to send 10,000 more troops to the border. The U.S. is also expected to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons into Mexico.</p><p>The last-minute maneuvering demonstrated Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/trump-economy-threats.html" title="">willingness to use tariffs as leverage</a> against America’s most important trading partners. Imports from Mexico, Canada and China, another target of tariffs, account for more than a third of the products brought into the U.S. each year.</p><p>Trump’s levies against China are still set to take effect tomorrow. He said he was planning to soon discuss the tariffs with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. However, the president described the 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports as an “opening salvo.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators outside of the U.S.A.I.D. headquarters today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L.

Soon after, employees were told not to report to work today. And by midday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/usaid-trump-musk.html" title="">declared that he had taken over as acting administrator of the agency</a>, which had been largely independent for decades.</p><p>Senior officials have been suspended, and hundreds of civil servants and contractors have been iced out of U.S.A.I.D. systems without warning. Rubio said that many of the agency’s programs would continue, but blamed the change on its workers’ “insubordination.”</p><p>More than 100 U.S.A.I.D. employees gathered in front of the agency’s headquarters in Washington with Democratic lawmakers to protest the moves. Democrats have denounced Musk’s planned shutdown as illegal because Congress created and funds the agency as a distinct entity. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/usaid-foreign-aid-musk.html" title="">Here’s what U.S.A.I.D. does</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural in Tehran depicting Iran’s first hypersonic ballistic missile.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-60a3e13c">U.S. believes Iran is considering a faster, cruder nuclear weapon</h2><p>Iran’s engineers are exploring how to rapidly turn their stockpiles of nuclear fuel into a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/iran-nuclear-weapon.html" title="">workable, but perhaps crude, atomic weapon</a>, according to U.S. officials. Iran’s leaders have not yet decided whether to pursue such a weapon, officials said, but as their proxy forces have suffered major losses, Iran has explored new ways to defend against an attack.</p><p>The findings, based on intelligence collected near the end of the Biden administration, will almost certainly be discussed tomorrow, when the Israeli prime minister is set to meet with Trump. The question of whether to strike Iran’s facilities or negotiate with Tehran appears to be under debate.</p><p><strong>In other news from the Middle East, </strong>four models for Gaza’s postwar future <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/world/middleeast/gaza-post-war-israel-hamas-palestinian-authority.html" title="">are beginning to take shape</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The wreckage on the Potomac River today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Al Drago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-3dbef458">Crews began clearing wreckage from D.C. plane crash</h2><p>Salvage crews lifted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/dc-plane-crash-potomac-river-wreckage.html" title="">first wreckage of American Airlines Flight 5342 from the Potomac</a> River today.
