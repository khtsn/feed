But in an eye-of-the-beholder eureka moment, the admen were inspired to create the classic singing-cat commercial that put Meow Mix on the map.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/obituaries/13Travisano-still/13Travisano-still-superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The original commercial for Meow Mix won a Clio Award.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Della Femina Advertising</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The endearing “Meow, meow, meow, meow” commercial for Ralston Purina — accompanied by the tagline “The cat food that cats ask for by name,” written by Mr. Travisano’s collaborators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/business/neil-drossman-dead.html" title="">Neil Drossman</a> and Bob Kuperman, who also came up with the name Meow Mix — won a Clio and other industry awards. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Nearly two decades after the ad debuted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/26/business/media-business-advertising-campaign-for-meow-mix-brings-back-popular-singing-cat.html" title="">The Times</a> described it as having “one of the best known, most readily sung commercial jingles.” (The insistent meowing, mouthed by the singer Linda November, was presumably less endearing when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/01/us/fresh-details-emerge-on-harsh-methods-at-guantanamo.html" title="">played repeatedly</a> to torture terrorism suspects at the U.S. prison compound at Guantánamo Bay.)</p><p>Mr. Travisano served as the vice chairman, president and creative director of Della Femina, Travisano &amp; Partners until 1985, when he left to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/25/business/the-media-business-advertising-travisano-and-cousin-doing-well.html" title="">start his own company</a>, with his cousin Frank DiGiacomo, to focus on directing commercials. He retired from the advertising business in 2001.</p><p>Mr. Travisano died on Jan. 21 at a hospital in Livingston, N.J. He was 86.</p><p>The cause was complications of a stroke, said his son Vincent, who confirmed the death. A longtime resident of Glen Ridge, N.J., Mr. Travisano had been living in Cedar Grove, N.J., at<span>  </span>his death.</p><p>When he and Mr. Della Femina began their collaboration in 1967, it was the dawn of a creative revolution on Madison Avenue. Mr. Travisano was 29; Mr. Della Femina, 30. They were surrounded by other young copywriters and art directors who were unafraid to fail or have fun. Mr. Della Femina wrote that working in advertising was becoming “the most fun you can have with your clothes on.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Another series of Advertising Hall of Fame commercials that Mr. Travisano and Mr. Della Femina created were the self-parodying ads for American Isuzu Motors broadcast in the 1980s.</p><p>With subtitles like “Sounds like a lie” and “He’s lying,” the ads featured a fictional pitchman called Joe Isuzu who made outlandish claims about his cars — that they cost just $9, for example, or that his Isuzu could outrace a bullet (one that he caught in his teeth).</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/obituaries/13Travisano-isuzu-still/13Travisano-isuzu-still-superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The Joe Isuzu commercials featured a fictional pitchman who made outlandish claims about his cars that were contradicted by subtitles pointing out that he was lying.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Della Femina Advertising</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Those commercials became so recognizable that in a 1988 presidential debate Michael Dukakis could call George H.W. Bush “the Joe Isuzu of American politics” with no further explanation required.</p><p>“I refuse to do ‘bite and smile’ commercials,” Mr. Travisano told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/25/business/the-media-business-advertising-travisano-and-cousin-doing-well.html" title="">The New York Times</a> in 1989. “‘I just ate this roll — ooh! aah!’ That’s not real. Even the Joe Isuzu ads — they’re cartoons, but the lighting, the touches, the reactions are real.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He worked on a number of other notable accounts as well, including Rolls-Royce, Blue Nun wine (promoted in ads featuring Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara), WABC-TV, the New York Mets and Geritol. </p><p>Over the years, Mr. Travisano’s imaginative work won Gold and Silver Lions at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity and 15 of the industry’s<span>  </span>Clio Awards for his agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Blue Nun ad campaign promoted the idea that it was a white wine “that’s correct with any dish.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Della Femina Agency</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“The ads will feature a driver in a street (upscale street, of course) right next to a Cadillac, a Mercedes or a BMW, the drivers of which are always casting envious glances at the Rolls and its self-confident owner,” The Times noted in 1985, of the new Rolls-Royce ad campaign.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Della Femina Agency</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I’m an artist, a photographer and a frustrated actor,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/11/business/advertising-agency-s-travisano-moving-on.html" title="">he told The Times in 1985, when he left the agency</a>. “When I see all those lights and the cables on the floor I get excited.”</p><p>As his cousin and new business partner, Mr. DiGiacomo, put it, the burly Mr. Travisano was “a man of extremes,” who at one point or another became infatuated with a swami and a hypnotist, and then found Jesus “in a match made in heaven.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ronald Donato Travisano was born on May 3, 1938, in Newark, to Ben Travisano, a hairdresser who owned a beauty parlor, and Phyllis (DiGiacomo) Travisano, who ran a real estate agency.</p><p>He grew up in Kearny, N.J., where he met his future wife, Frances Bongiovanni, whom he married in 1961. She died in 2011.</p><p>In addition to his son Vincent, he is survived by his sons Ronald and Philip; his daughter, Laura Hurley; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. </p><p>After attending Carteret Prep School, in West Orange, N.J., he graduated in 1960 from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn with a bachelor’s degree in advertising design. (Later, he returned to teach at Pratt and also taught at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.)</p><p>He worked his way up from the mail room at Young &amp; Rubicam, was hired as an art director at McCann-Marschalk and as a supervisor at two other agencies, Delehanty Kurnit &amp; Geller and Ted Bates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Travisano, seated on the far right, in the 1960s, with his colleagues at Della Femina, Travisano &amp; Partners. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Travisano family</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>When he and Mr. Della Femina became partners, their first account was for Squire, a company that made hairpieces. Their pitch was headlined: “Are you still combing your memories?”</p><p>“There were things that I might say to Ron and he’ll say, ‘Are you crazy? You can’t say that,’” Mr. Della Femina recalled in his 1970 memoir, “From Those Wonderful Folks Who Brought You Pearl Harbor.” (The title was a slogan he facetiously suggested for Panasonic.) “He’ll then say, ‘But what if we did this?’ And he’ll come up with something that’s completely outlandish,” but sparks some viable alternative.</p><p>Mr. Travisano raised $80,000 to finance the new agency, but it opened inauspiciously, with four partners who were making less, collectively, than their $125-a-week receptionist, Mr. Della Femina recalled in his eulogy for Mr. Travisano. Mr. Della Femina suggested that they take their last few thousand dollars and throw an extravagant Christmas party at L’Etoile to create the illusion of success.</p><p>“At one point, I reached over to take an hors d’oeuvre a waiter was carrying on a huge tray,” Mr. Della Femina said. “Ron came over and whispered into my ear, ‘Don’t eat that. We may need it for lunch tomorrow.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The party succeeded in impressing potential clients, and the agency prospered. By the time Mr. Travisano sold his shares in 1985, it had some 300 employees and more than $350 million in annual billings.</p><p>On the subject of eating, Mr. Della Femina had one more point to make. In a recent interview, he added a coda to the story of Mr. Travisano’s epiphany about the footage that inspired the Meow Mix commercial.</p><p>The cat that was choking, he noted, survived.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Feb. 16, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this obituary misstated the year of the presidential debate between Michael Dukakis and George H.W. Bush. It was 1988, not 1982.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Sam Roberts is an obituaries reporter for The Times, writing mini-biographies about the lives of remarkable people.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
