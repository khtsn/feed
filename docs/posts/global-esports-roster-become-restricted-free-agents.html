</span> player roster have entered restricted free agency, per a <a href="https://x.com/RushindraSinha/status/1826311003141013588?t=KbDFepPoXiZaApb4vnq1rQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank">tweet</a> from the Global Esports founder. This change comes soon after <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/372009/global-esports-part-with-spin-and-bigtime" target="_blank">releasing</a> their coaching staff and <a href="https://x.com/GlobalEsportsIn/status/1825521516517437790" target="_blank">announcing</a> open tryouts for their 2025 roster. </p>

<p>Following an unsuccessful 2023 season, Global Esports made a complete overhaul of their roster, with not a single player from the starting five making a return for 2024. Their new roster consisted of a crop of underdog players from all around the world. The rebuild started with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/274518/lightningfast-continues-with-global-esports" target="_blank">promoting</a> their longstanding member and previous sixth man, <span data-ref-id="1">Abhirup		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3626/lightningfast">Lightningfast</a>&#34;

<p>Going into the 2024 season, Global Esports was not very highly rated in comparison to their competition in Pacific. They looked to defy these expectations early on with a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/296738/bleed-vs-global-esports-champions-tour-2024-pacific-kickoff-elim-a" target="_blank">win</a> against the Ascension winning <span data-ref-id="9">

</span> put Masters Madrid out of their sights. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2002/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> was a similar story, with their 2-3 record being insufficient to qualify them to playoffs. With their poor performance in Stage 1, they would&#39;ve needed a miraculous <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2/regular-season" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> for the team to come anywhere close to qualifying to playoffs, let alone Champions. They would only pick up one more win for the rest of the season, ending with a record of 3-7, and placing ninth in the league.</p>

<em>Global Esports after their win against Bleed during Kickoff</em></p>

<p>Global Esports is looking towards a complete overhaul of the entire team going into 2025. A new coaching staff as well as a roster found through open tryouts will bring a completely fresh look for the Indian organization. Their current player roster will also be put through the team&#39;s tryouts, with a chance to return to the active roster in 2025, but have been allowed to explore other options during the off season.</p>

<p>Global Esports are now:</p>

<p>SkRossi was a lot better player than we saw him on the international stage.  HE also couldn&#39;t perform due to a lot of role switches... and what do I say about Bazzi and WRONSKI, GE just ruined them. </p>		</div>

			<p>Well, blaZek1ng and Lightningfast for a start showed promise, keep those two and rebuild around them. Look at FNC for example. They kept Boaster and Derke throughout their stint in Valorant and added better pieces to the puzzle as time went on, and you can see how strong their roster is now.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t just cut everyone because the roster didn&#39;t achieve much. If that&#39;s the case then DFM should nuke their roster since they had a worse year than GE, but they&#39;re keeping Meiy who was a standout performer, and are maybe going from there. People are downvoting me cuz they don&#39;t understand how roster building works and their solution is just &#34;nuke the team&#34;. It doesn&#39;t work that way...</p>		</div>

		<p>There was no meiy in GE though. Polvi was below average. Russ was ok. Lightning fast was good in only few games same as blazeking and benkai was b0nkai. </p>

		<p>yep, look how Bleed did every time they removed pieces. It&#39;s not easy starting a fresh new 5 and expect everything to magically work out. DSG is also an example of this. NRG is an example of this, too much newness based on perceived talent and accomplishments alone is not enough. Just an uphill climb for any org who does this imo.</p>
