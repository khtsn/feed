and instead passing paper documents in envelopes to each chambers. Faced with ethics controversies and a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/08/favorable-views-of-supreme-court-remain-near-historic-low/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plunge</a> in public trust, they were debating rules for their own conduct, according to people familiar with the process.</p><p>Weeks later, as a united front, they announced the results: the court’s first-ever <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/Code-of-Conduct-for-Justices_November_13_2023.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ethics code</a>. “It’s remarkable that we were able to agree unanimously,” Justice Neil M.

The justices’ strength was their independence, he said, and he vowed to have no part in diminishing it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In the private exchanges, Justice Clarence Thomas, whose decision not to disclose decades of gifts and luxury vacations from wealthy benefactors had <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sparked</a> the ethics controversy, and Justice Samuel A.

But their argument never had a chance.</p><p>To piece together the previously undisclosed debate, The Times interviewed people from inside and outside the court, including liberals and conservatives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the proceedings and the justices’ thinking. This article also draws upon public statements by the justices, who declined to comment.</p><p>While the court was praised for setting ethics rules, the lack of an enforcement provision has been criticized by ethics experts and figures on the left. One year later, the justices’ internal debate has spilled into a wider, more fractious one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>President Biden and Democratic <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/us-supreme-courts-roberts-hears-key-democrats-call-enforceable-ethics-code-2024-09-17/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawmakers</a> have called for a code with teeth. Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-elena-kagan-ethics-code-0de5fc0fb31eaab57202cf96b4e9c3e7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly</a> pledged support for an enforcement mechanism. Outside legal experts have circulated proposals that would enlist the guidance of other federal judges. The conservative pushback has been strong and sometimes furious.</p><p>Now the election of former President Donald J. Trump, and a new era of unified Republican government, are raising the stakes for a branch supposed to serve as an independent guardrail. The court, which has a conservative supermajority, is already perceived as partisan by many Americans. And the justices largely appear to be split along the same lines on how far to go to ensure that its rules are followed.</p><p>Outside the court, critics say they are trying to bolster trust in the institution by holding the justices to similar standards as lower-court judges. Because no outsiders are involved in enforcing the new code, it lacks “any way to give the justices a chance to look in the mirror,” said Jeremy Fogel, a retired federal judge appointed by President Bill Clinton and a judicial ethics <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/jeremy-fogel/#tab_profile" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expert</a> who recently proposed an enforcement plan.</p><p>Many conservatives, however, suspect liberals of trying to make ideologically driven incursions on the court. “I’m distrustful of calls for reform or change, because they’re so motivated by antipathy to the current court’s decisions,” said Thomas Griffith, a retired federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush. He and others argued that more stringent oversight could weaken the court’s integrity, because it could be used as a weapon, or give rise to constant warfare about which justices would hear each case.</p><p>Even as Judges Fogel and Griffith made opposing points, they acknowledged the danger of a debate about judicial conduct that splits along partisan lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s not a blue/red issue,” Judge Fogel said. “If confidence in the Supreme Court tanks, then confidence in the whole system tanks.”</p><h2 id="link-6a531e8b">A Closed-Door Debate</h2><p>The discussions were treated with extra secrecy because they were so sensitive, according to people from the court. Instead of the usual legal issues, the justices were contending with controversy about finances and gifts from friends, and some of the ground rules of their own institution.</p><p>For years, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had resisted efforts to hold the court to the same <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/code-conduct-united-states-judges" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ethics rules</a> that bind all other federal judges. In addition to the longstanding code, those judges can rely on a committee that dispenses advice. Any ethics complaints that arise are routed to chief circuit judges, who can convene other judges to investigate, and if necessary, take actions that range from discreet warning to censure.</p><p>All 50 states have avenues for examining complaints about members of their highest courts. On Monday, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-11-26-Judicial-Ethics-50-State-Survey.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> detailing how state supreme court members are subject to ethics oversight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The justices of the nation’s highest court have no such system, reflecting their singular power. They are the last word, by design. Their tenure is for life, save the unlikely threat of impeachment. While a legal office at the court dispenses ethics advice to justices upon request, the counsel is not binding, and not all the justices have consistently sought it out, according to several people familiar with the office.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg each took trips funded by wealthy businessmen who had had matters before the court.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haraz N.

In 2013, Justice Stephen G. Breyer <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/230602261/Breyer-2013-SCOTUS-Financial-Disclosure-Report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jetted</a> to Nantucket on the dime of a private equity mogul.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg toured Israel in 2018 as the <a href="https://fixthecourt.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ginsburg-2018.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guest</a> of a billionaire whose company had benefited a year earlier when the justices declined to take up a patent case.</p><p>In 2019, Justice Kagan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/us/supreme-court-ethics-code.html" title="">mentioned</a> that the chief justice was exploring ethics reform, but years passed with no result.</p><p>Last year, pressure on the court and the chief justice intensified. Journalists revealed that Justice Thomas had accepted <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">far more largess</a> from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/us/politics/19thomas.html" title="">Harlan Crow</a>, a conservative donor, than he had disclosed, including decades of travel on private jets and a superyacht, and boarding school tuition for his grandnephew.

Lawmakers were opening investigations and proposing tighter ethics reporting rules. In May 2023, the chief justice made a public concession, saying the court could take further steps to “adhere to the highest standards” of conduct. Three months later, he gave his colleagues the first draft of the code, prepared by <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/dow-robert-michael-jr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Robert M. Dow Jr.</a>, a staff member who advises the chief justice.

In some areas, the justices promised the obvious: not to make speeches for political candidates or participate in cases in which they have financial interests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>But they gave themselves no firm restrictions on gifts, travel or real estate deals. Nothing in the new rules appears aimed directly at the trips and gifts Justice Thomas accepted. The code says only that justices should uphold the dignity of the office and comply with existing gift guidelines, in separate federal rules, which make allowances for “personal hospitality.” Justice Thomas has maintained that his nondisclosure of gifts and free travel did not violate those rules.</p><p>Sarah Isgur, co-host of “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/advisory-opinions/id1490993194" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Advisory Opinions</a>,” a podcast about the court, said the justices seemed to be trying to preserve some latitude amid the constraints imposed by security threats, protests and heavy scrutiny.</p><p>“They are already so isolated,” she said. “I don’t know that people fully appreciate what the life of a Supreme Court justice is.”</p><p>They gave themselves a broad carve-out for book deals and sales, one of the few ways they can make substantial outside income.

In the internal conversations, several of the justices emphasized their “duty to sit,” or obligation to hear cases: If a justice recuses, there is no one else to step in.</p><p>They provided no avenue for complaint or challenge. Judge Fogel, the ethics expert, said the justices put themselves in “a box you never want to be in as a judge, which is evaluating your own recusals without an independent process for checking your judgment.”</p><p>As the justices were formulating these rules, cases about the 2020 election and its aftermath were winding their way to the court. Despite the involvement of Justice Thomas’s wife, he only recused himself from one of them, involving one of his former clerks.</p><p>The most significant departure from the lower-court rules, and the sharpest philosophical divide among the justices, was over whether to enforce the rules they were formulating.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>All three liberals — Justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson — supported enforcement.</p><p>In an apparent attempt to make a higher level of scrutiny palatable to their colleagues, Justice Kagan proposed an initial step, involving a small group of veteran federal judges, according to people familiar with the discussions. She sketched out what she called a “safe harbor” system that would give the justices incentive to consult the judges about ethics issues. Later, if the justices were criticized — say, for accepting a gift — they could respond that they had obtained clearance beforehand.</p><p>“There are plenty of judges around this country who could do a task like that in a very fair-minded and serious way,” Justice Kagan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/supreme-court-kagan-ethics.html" title="">said</a> at a public appearance this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The court faced increasing pressure to codify ethics rules, something Chief Justice John G.

Justice Alito echoed some of those concerns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Oversight of Supreme Court justices is a genuine dilemma, said Wallace B. Jefferson, former chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, who was elected as a Republican.
