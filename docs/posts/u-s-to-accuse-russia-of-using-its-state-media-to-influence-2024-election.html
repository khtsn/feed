    <h1>U.S. to Accuse Russia of Using Its State Media to Influence 2024 Election</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The United States has said that Russian intelligence agencies have been using RT, the state-owned broadcaster, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/russian-bots-artificial-intelligence-propaganda.html" title="">spread disinformation through bots</a> and other efforts. U.S. officials have been looking more closely at how the Kremlin and its spy agencies use RT to influence the election.</p><p>Attorney General Merrick B. Garland is holding a meeting of the Justice Department’s Election Threats Task Force on Wednesday and is expected to announce the indictments and detail the government’s latest efforts to halt Russian interference. Other officials, including Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and Matthew G. Olsen, the head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, will be in attendance.</p><p>The United States was caught flat-footed in 2016 as its spy agencies learned about Russian efforts to influence the vote on behalf of Mr. Trump and were late in warning the public. In subsequent elections, U.S. intelligence officials were more aggressive at quickly calling out Russian, Chinese and Iranian efforts to influence American elections.</p><p>But officials say that fighting election interference has been more difficult this year. Some Americans, particularly Mr. Trump’s supporters, see accusations that Russia is spreading disinformation as efforts to undermine their views and policy positions.</p><p>The United States has taken some action against Russian organizations it believes are trying to influence American politics. In March, the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2195" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Treasury Department sanctioned a Russian group</a> that has aided efforts to create fake news sites that spread misinformation.</p></div></div>
