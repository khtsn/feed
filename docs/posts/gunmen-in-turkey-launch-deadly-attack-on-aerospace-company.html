    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gunmen assaulted the headquarters of Turkey’s state-run aerospace company in the capital Ankara on Wednesday in what Turkish officials called a “terrorist attack.”</p><p>In a social media post, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya confirmed the attack on <a href="https://www.tusas.com/en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Turkish Aerospace Industries</a> and said it had caused a number of dead and wounded.</p><p>Anil Sahin, a defense industry reporter, told Haberturk, a Turkish news network, that two militants had come to company’s headquarters in a taxi. One blew himself up while the other fired at the complex’s security guards.</p><p>A video from the scene, which aired on Turkish television networks, showed gray smoke from what appeared to be an explosion and a man who appeared to be an attacker running with an assault rifle. Images from surveillance cameras inside a building showed two attackers, a man and a woman, with backpacks and rifles near the entrance and a body lying on the pavement outside.</p></div></div>
