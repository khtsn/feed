She scrambled together a few of her belongings and made a run for it, heading for a nearby bridge.</p><p>In an instant, she said, “the water rose from my knee to my hip to my chest to my neck.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adama Ibrahim assessing the damage at her home in Maiduguri, two weeks after she and her 4-year-old son were separated in the flood.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After a dam collapsed last month in Maiduguri, bridges were washed away and many people were killed.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>All she could do was try to keep Mahmud’s head out of the water, hugging his small body to her chest, and pray for rescue.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Help took hours. When it came in the form of a few men with a truck, they would take only children. Ms. Ibrahim handed over Mahmud, a clingy, affectionate toddler, with no idea if either of them would survive.</p><p>“Just go,” she told her son.</p><p>When she was finally thrown, half drowned, into a rescue truck, she saw a woman and a child crushed to death by panicked people crowding into the vehicle, she said.</p><p>All around them, the city was in a frenzy.</p><p>Fishermen by the dam capsized and drowned in the surging water. One woman described seeing dozens of her neighbors, including children, swept away to their deaths, trying to flee. Disabled people who once begged outside government offices vanished.</p><p>Ms. Ibrahim scoured the devastated city looking for Mahmud. She felt she was losing her mind. After three days, she finally found him.</p><p>Nigeria’s emergency management agencies have refused to release a death toll, but according to community members, rescue workers and security personnel unauthorized to speak publicly, it is as many as 1,000. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-3013b7c9">Raising the Alarm</h2><p>Most people in Maiduguri had no experience with serious flooding. The city, just on the edge of the Sahel, is arid for much of the year. Water came from the small Alau dam, which was constructed of masonry and earth in 1985 by a Greek contractor for the federal government, with the promise of improving the water supply to Maiduguri and nearby farmland.</p><p>Villagers in the community of about 2,000 that lived alongside the dam and fished in its waters knew when they saw a problem.</p><p>In 2021, they said a crack appeared in the dam’s earthen embankment, and then the concrete channel designed to allow surplus water to flow out began to collapse. They alerted officials about the dam’s degraded state and the need to release more water. They told the local government council, the military, the federal agency responsible for monitoring, maintaining and repairing the dam, and just about anyone else who would listen.</p><p>“We’ve complained so many times,” said Shettima Mohammed, 70, a farmer and fish dealer from the village of Lawajeri. But, he and other villagers said, the authorities either dismissed their warnings, made excuses for not taking action or occasionally delivered sandbags in a futile attempt to fortify the damaged embankment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Flooded rice paddies in Jere, close to Maiduguri.

He and his team <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13902528" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that the agency overseeing the dam — the Chad Basin Development Agency — had spent years, possibly decades, letting the dam overfill before opening its sluice gates.</p><p>The first principle of dam safety is to not let it overfill, Mr. Gutti said. But according to his research, this was done over and over again, putting the dam under intense hydraulic pressure.</p><p>“Every year they repeat the same mistake,” he said in an interview.</p><p>Adding to the pressure the dam was under, the agency had also let it fill with silt, the engineers said, meaning there was much less room for rainwater. Together, this caused the dam to crack and crumble, Mr. Gutti said.</p><p> In a phone interview, Mohammed Zannah, the acting managing director of the agency, acknowledged that the dam had been damaged for several years. He confirmed that the sluice gates were only opened and closed once a year and said his agency did not have enough money for dredging.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>But he denied that the reservoir had ever overfilled, that he received warnings from the engineers and that the dam had collapsed in the flood. Instead, he claimed that the obliterated earthen embankments were not part of the dam, as they were not made of concrete. He also defended having told the public that the dam posed no danger before the flooding.</p><p>He blamed the flood on increased rainfall caused by climate change.</p><h2 id="link-3119391f">Running Out of Water</h2><p>Humanitarian agencies and government officials have warned that the next disaster facing Maiduguri will be severe water and food shortages.</p><p>Crops that would have fed 1.6 million people for six months were lost in the flood, according to Chi Lael, a spokeswoman for the United Nations World Food Program. And with the dam broken, farmers say there will not be enough water to grow next season’s rice, sorghum and sweet potatoes.</p><p>Now, residents of Maiduguri must rely on the few working boreholes that are not contaminated with floodwater to survive.</p><p>Officials have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T4WhPqCNYo&amp;ab_channel=NewsCentralTV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">descended</a> on the Alau dam since the disaster, promising its rehabilitation or reconstruction. Nigeria’s president, Bola Tinubu, has said integrity tests will be done on all the country’s dams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“We are giving assurance to Nigerians that this is going to end well,” Joseph Utsev, the minister of water and sanitation, <a href="https://punchng.com/inter-ministerial-committee-on-dam-evaluation-meets-in-abuja/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said this month</a> at a meeting of a new committee tasked with evaluating Nigeria’s dams.</p><p>For residents of Maiduguri, the aftermath of the flooding has become another tragedy with which to contend. The area is home to hundreds of thousands of people who fled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/world/africa/boko-haram-nigeria-mafa-attack.html" title="">Boko Haram</a> in recent years after it murdered and kidnapped tens of thousands of people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>During the flood, Fatima Mala clung to this tree, by the tent she has lived in since fleeing Boko Haram.

But she managed to keep them alive until they were rescued.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Since the flood, Ms. Mala and her family have been sleeping on a highway center divider — the highest ground they could find. Her husband sold their phone for $2.50 to buy food for the children. It was their last possession.</p><p>As she waited in line recently for a cash handout from a Catholic <a href="https://www.crs.org/our-work-overseas/where-we-work/nigeria" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">humanitarian agency</a>, Ms. Mala wondered how they would survive. The family was preparing to move back to the tarpaulin tent they had lived under for six years, now half-wrecked and covered in mud.</p><p>She has no idea how they will get water.</p><p>Even before the flood, her family used to beg for it from nearby houses with boreholes. Now, those boreholes are all contaminated.</p><p>“With Boko Haram, once you’ve fled, you can sleep. With this, our chances of survival are slim,” she said. “For me, the flood is worse than Boko Haram.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ruth Maclean is the West Africa bureau chief for The Times, covering 25 countries including Nigeria, Congo, the countries in the Sahel region as well as Central Africa.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ruth-maclean">More about Ruth Maclean</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Despite Grave Warnings, Dam Fails and Hundreds Die<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
