The shift intensified this week, when he suspended the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, according <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/03/us/trump-news-congress" title="">to senior administration officials</a>. </p><p>America’s realignment has left Europe racing to help Ukraine in the short term and to ensure that it is prepared to defend itself from a more aggressive Russia in the long term.</p><p>The options proposed by Ms. von der Leyen mostly involve loans and looser budget rules. Ultimately, the decisions about whether to boost military spending will be made by E.U. member states, whose finances are already under pressure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, set out a broad plan to boost European defense spending by as much as 800 billion euros.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yves Herman/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But with Ukraine facing a critical shortfall in weaponry in its war against Russia, the timing is increasingly urgent. Ms. von der Leyen unveiled her proposal ahead of a meeting of heads of state and government from across the bloc’s 27 member nations in Brussels on Thursday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-27195c9b">A new defense fund</h2><p>Perhaps the most novel part of the proposal is the €150 billion program to make defense-related loans from the E.U. to member states. The funds could be used to pay for a range of investments: air and missile defense, artillery, drones and anti-drone systems, cybertechnologies and infrastructure projects.</p><p>Funding for the program would be raised in capital markets, according to senior European Commission officials. To set it up, the E.U. would rely on <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX%3A12008E122%3AEN%3AHTML" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an emergency provision</a> that allows for financial assistance to member states in exceptional circumstances. The plan would have to be approved by slightly more than a majority of the European Council — a relatively low barrier.</p><p>The loans would be meant to pave the way for big investments that would not overlap. The money would be allocated to member states by the commission based on demand, officials said.</p><p>“It will help member states to pool demand and to buy together,” Ms. von der Leyen said. “With this equipment, member states can massively step up their support to Ukraine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2cb1bec2">Wiggle room for budgets</h2><p>Ms. von der Leyen had already announced that <a href="https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/1890413781270032408" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she would propose</a> exempting defense investments from strict European Union deficit rules.</p><p>European defense spending has <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/defence-numbers/#:~:text=Between%202021%20and%202024%2C%20EU,about%201.9%25%20of%20EU%20GDP." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climbed 30 percent</a> since 2021, but it remains well below the levels that officials say are needed for Europe to become more truly independent from the United States. And budget limitations are already biting.</p><p>E.U. countries are supposed to keep their deficits — the gap between how much they spend and how much money they bring in through taxes and fees — to below 3 percent of their economic output, while limiting their debt. Failure to do so can result in fines. Eight countries, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/excessive-deficit-procedure/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including</a> Belgium and Poland, are already bumping up against the limits or are seriously in breach of them, as is France.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Polish soldiers in the Tatra National Park near Zakopane, Poland, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergei Gapon/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Given that, Europe has been trying to find ways to allow individual nations to spend more on defense without making drastic cuts elsewhere, for instance to health care or social services.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. von der Leyen suggested on Tuesday that a budget “escape clause” would be a central part of her plan.</p><p>She suggested that if European nations used the space to increase spending by another 1.5 percent of gross domestic product — nearly doubling it from just under 2 percent now — that would add up to about €650 billion over four years.</p><p>But even if the European Council approves the escape clause, it’s not clear whether individual states would decide to spend the extra money and increase their deficits.</p><h2 id="link-412df5ac">Redirecting capital</h2><p>Other programs that the E.U. already has underway could be redirected toward defense, Ms. von der Leyen suggested.</p><p>She proposed allowing member states to use what is called <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/policy/what/investment-policy_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“cohesion” funding</a> — which usually helps poorer member states pay for economic development — to pay for military spending.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Another option is to use the European Investment Bank to help to fund the defense buildup. The bank has <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/eib-to-up-defence-investment-to-e2bn-this-year/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already been increasing</a> its lending to security-related projects, though it is somewhat limited by its lending criteria.</p><p>European officials have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eib-lift-limits-defence-financing-broaden-scope-eligible-projects-2025-03-04/?taid=67c717d3e9b90e00018aa094&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called for rule changes</a> that would allow the bank to invest in purely military projects, which it <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/projects/topics/innovation-digital-and-human-capital/sesi/index" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cannot do currently</a>.</p><h2 id="link-539d069d">What’s not in the proposal</h2><p>If Ms. von der Leyen’s proposal had an overarching theme, it was that it can be done quickly within the E.U.’s existing framework. But the proposal stopped short of some more ambitious ideas — and lacked a few widely anticipated details.</p><p>Defense analysts have been watching to see how the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/europe-ukraine-russia.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/europe-ukraine-russia.html" title="">E.U. might</a> work with Britain and Norway, which are not in the bloc. Keir Starmer, the prime minister of Britain, promised this week the formation of a “coalition of the willing” to support Ukraine. But there was nothing in the proposal about a broader collaboration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left: President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France in London on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Justin Tallis</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Likewise, it is not clear what specific help is coming for Ukraine, versus what will be used to beef up European defense more broadly. E.U. countries have been talking about cobbling together a package for Ukraine financial support that could be worth as much as €20 billion, but Ms. von der Leyen did not talk about those plans on Tuesday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Given that, the fresh proposal is most likely a starting point. More detail could come on and after Thursday, and even more when the commission is set to present a paper on defense in March.</p><p>“It’s a start, it’s a good signal, but she didn’t go as big as maybe most of us would have expected,” said Maria Martisiute, a policy analyst at the European Policy Center focused on defense. “She’s not revealing all her cards now.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Steven Erlanger is the chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe and is based in Berlin.
