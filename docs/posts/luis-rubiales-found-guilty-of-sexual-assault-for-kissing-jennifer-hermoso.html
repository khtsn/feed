    <h1>Luis Rubiales Found Guilty of Sexual Assault for Kissing Jennifer Hermoso</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Rubiales was also ordered not to go within 200 meters, or about 650 feet, of Ms. Hermoso for one year. The court said he cannot contact Ms. Hermoso and must pay her 3,000 euros (about $3,130) for “moral damage caused to her.”</p><p>Judge Gonzales said the sum was proportionate for the forcible kiss, especially given the “time and place” — in full view of thousands of spectators in the stadium and many others watching the ceremony on television.</p><p>There was no immediate response from Ms. Hermoso. She had said that the kiss was not consensual, which Mr. Rubiales disputed. Speaking in a courtroom near Madrid earlier this month, he said, “You don’t win a World Cup every day,” and he added that he had kissed other players in celebratory moments.</p><p>Prosecutors said the former soccer boss had pressured Ms. Hermoso to drop her claim and play down the incident.</p></div></div>
