Then it was the slow abandonment of bus lanes (the city is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/street-wars-bus-lanes.html" title="">on track</a> to build just 27 miles of the 150 miles promised by Mayor Eric Adams). And now, bit by bit, New York City’s <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/adrienne-adams-outdoor-dining-street/?ref=hellgatenyc.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overwhelmingly popular</a> outdoor dining is collapsing.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a more illogical, infuriating and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/nyregion/congestion-pricing-mta-budget-nyc.html" title="">self-defeating</a> series of capitulations than those made by New York’s leadership — from the governor’s office to city boards — to the relatively small demographic of auto-reliant New Yorkers and commuters, as well as those city residents who seem to think their neighborhoods <a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2023/08/03/controversy-al-fresco-big-changes-coming-to-outdoor-dining" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">should resemble quiet suburbs</a>.</p><p>On one street near where I live in Brooklyn, almost all of the dining sheds are gone. In spaces that would once have fed dozens of people in an evening, there instead sits a single car, occasionally two. Where people could have socialized, eaten and supported the local economy, helping small businesses stay afloat, there is now a space that serves the <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/25/nyc-transforms-site-of-award-winning-outdoor-dining-space-into-street-parking?ref=hellgatenyc.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">desire to park</a>. Across the city, the story is similar: The sheds have gone, fallen victim to onerous new rules under which just 2,600 restaurants <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/08/05/outdoor-dining-open-restaurants-covid-new-rules/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">applied</a> for outdoor dining permits, a far cry from the more than 12,000 that had used the pandemic-era program.</p><p>For restaurants, the stakes are bleak: They must tear down, at great cost, the structures just recently built, also at great cost. They will often have to <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/new-nyc-outdoor-dining-rules-poison-pill/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lay off members of their staff</a>. They will lose revenue. And once the structures are down, rebuilding them is costly. Restaurant owners note that dining structures — often professionally built, some award-winning — cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to build, and cannot be remade on a whim. Once down for a season, they’re probably down for good.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The city’s mandate that outdoor dining be seasonal, with structures removed each winter, will effectively end the program for those restaurants, since most cannot afford to rebuild every year. Many only built the structures after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/nyregion/nyc-outdoor-dining-restaurants.html" title="">the city promised</a> that outdoor dining would be permanent, even in winter. As one restaurant owner <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/new-nyc-outdoor-dining-rules-poison-pill/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the website HellGate</a>, “I voted for this mayor because he said he wanted to preserve outdoor dining. And he’s not.”</p><p>Outdoor dining’s detractors had many arguments: that it attracted rats (outdoor dining <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/08/oh-rats-experts-say-outdoor-dining-is-not-to-blame-for-the-citys-rodent-problem" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">probably wasn’t to blame</a>), that it was too <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/realestate/outdoor-dining-noise.html" title="">noisy</a>, or simply that it <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/parking-spots-are-historic-nyc-outdoor-dining/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blocked</a> their parking spaces. But the system was popular with diners and restaurateurs, and its loss because of these narrow and self-serving complaints is another example of shortsightedness, lack of creativity and choosing an outdated status quo over a vision of a better, healthier city.</p><p>A gutless city government has undermined outdoor dining — adding it to the Second Avenue subway extension, shelved <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/manhattan/transit/2024/06/19/mta-halts-second-avenue-subway-expansion-following-congestion-pricing-pause" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by the rollback of congestion pricing</a> and innumerable bus lanes, in the dustbin of improvements New York City badly needs in order to stay vital.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
