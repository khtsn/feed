    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Once an election is over, hindsight can make the winner’s strategy look perfect and the loser’s seem doomed. As my colleague Jonathan Swan said recently on “The Daily”: “The winning campaign, everything they did was genius, and then the losing campaign are just a bunch of idiots. And the truth is that neither is necessarily true.”</p><p>The truth instead tends to be that presidential campaigns make strategic decisions that come with benefits as well as costs. And those decisions aren’t guaranteed to succeed or fail.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll analyze a core strategy that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have each pursued. After Tuesday, I suspect we will come to see both as crucial, albeit in different ways.</p><h2 id="link-4d2cd01d">Harris’s caution</h2><p>On paper, Harris is the underdog. In rich countries around the world, incumbents are doing badly; the ruling parties in Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan have all recently lost power. In the U.S., President Biden has a 40 percent approval rating, and less than 30 percent of adults are satisfied with the country’s direction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Nate Cohn, The Times’s chief political analyst, points out that voters appear eager for change and specifically seem skeptical of progressivism. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/upshot/democrats-trump-election.html" title="">I recommend his essay on the subject.</a>)</p><p>Given this backdrop, Harris has run a strikingly cautious campaign. Game theorists would describe it as a low-variance strategy. She and her aides avoided moves that might have gone very well — and might have gone very poorly.</p><p>Can you name her campaign’s central theme, for example? Many of her main messages are vague (“when we fight, we win”), Trump-focused (“in it for himself”) or both (“turn the page”). Asked on television how her presidency would differ from Biden’s, Harris said, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”</p><p>She could have taken a different approach. She could have run on the populist, anti-corporate message that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000009776482/what-we-learned-from-democrats-ads-for-senate.html" title="">is helping Democratic Senate candidates</a> — or gone in the opposite direction and portrayed herself as a business-friendly centrist. She could have picked an issue, like housing, and signaled that it would be her No. 1 priority, much as health care was for Barack Obama. Instead of offering a bold, thematic message, Harris has announced a series of modest policies.</p><p>Her low-variance strategy is also evident in her decision not to explain why she reversed her stances on immigration and fracking. Many voters say they want to know more about Harris — who became a candidate only three months ago — and she hasn’t always filled in the blanks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The strategy is evident with the Middle East, too. She didn’t pick as her running mate the popular Jewish governor of Pennsylvania partly because many Israel critics opposed him. Her campaign also didn’t invite any Palestinians to speak at the Democratic convention, which may hurt her in Michigan. When possible, Harris has avoided conflict.</p><p>All these decisions have benefits, to be clear. Making the Middle East more salient is rarely smart in American politics. Explaining why she changed her mind about the border could have made her look weak. Doing more town halls and interviews to explain her views could have exposed one of Harris’s weaknesses: Although she is an excellent debater, she can struggle in less structured settings.</p><p>But if Harris loses, her caution will look problematic. Game theory usually dictates that an underdog should pursue a higher-variance strategy and hope a few risks pay off. Harris has instead bet that the U.S. will not follow the global anti-incumbent pattern — and that our election will be a referendum on Trump more than on Biden and her.</p><h2 id="link-37160b">Trump’s gamble</h2><p>Trump is such an instinctual politician that it can sound strange to analyze his behavior strategically. But his advisers do think strategically, and they have urged him to make some different decisions. Trump has overruled them, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/podcasts/the-daily/trump-campaign-arizona.html" title="">as Jonathan Swan has reported</a>.</p><p>They have told him the economy is his best issue and the one that matters most to Americans. Focusing on it could help Trump appeal to undecided voters, including those who liked the results of his presidency but don’t like his erratic style. Many of these people — Nikki Haley supporters, for example — are college graduates who will vote, one way or the other.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Economic arguments often bore Trump, however, and he has instead focused on immigration. “That beats out the economy,” he said at a recent rally. It’s part of a closing message focused on grievance, insults and divisive cultural subjects, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/trump-republican-transgender-ads.html" title="">his TV ads on trans issues</a>.</p><p>This anger can be appealing to Americans who are frustrated with the country’s direction and view the Democratic Party as elite, establishment and too far left. Many younger, male and nonwhite voters fall into this category. But relying on this group comes with a downside: It includes many people who don’t regularly vote.</p><p>Trump has made a big bet on turnout — and the idea that he will win by accentuating his persona rather than moderating it.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-65283dd">Voting</h2><ul><li><p>The presidential race <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" title="">looks like a photo finish in swing states,</a> the final set of polls by The New York Times and Siena College found.</p></li><li><p>But despite the deadlock, the figures show some notable shifts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/upshot/polls-harris-trump-battlegrounds.html" title="">Nate Cohn writes</a>.</p></li><li><p>Trump has improved his standing in Pennsylvania even as late-deciding voters appear to be breaking for Harris.</p></li><li><p>White women could determine the election.

His new book, “Consider the Turkey,” examines the overwhelming amount of animal mistreatment involved in the traditional Thanksgiving meal. We spoke about that, as well as what it really means to do good in the world.</em></p><p><strong>It feels hard to deny the unacceptable level of suffering that goes into our Thanksgiving turkey dinners. But millions of people are still going to have them. Do you ever feel as if you’re banging your head against the wall with this stuff?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>No. I feel like I’m banging my head against something which is pretty hard but not completely unyielding. In some parts of the world, we’ve made progress in the laws and regulations concerning animals. On the whole, yes, things are still bad, but it’s possible to make progress, and we have to keep bringing these facts in front of the public and getting them to think about what they’re eating. The Thanksgiving meal seems like a good place to start.</p><p><strong>I suspect most people see themselves as, on balance, a net good for the world. But how does someone </strong><strong><em>know?</em></strong></p><p>Very few people are doing enough to make the world a better place. They’re probably not. I don’t think that I’m doing enough to make the world a better place. But how would you know? You would look around for other ways of doing more to make the world a better place, and you would say, “There aren’t any.” That’s the extreme position.</p><p><strong>Where’s the line short of that?</strong></p><p>The line short of that is to say: “I’m doing a lot more than the current social standard is. I’m trying to raise that standard. I’m setting an example of doing more than the current standard.” If you can say those things, you can be content with what you’re doing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kerri Brewer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Store-bought gnocchi are best appreciated when seared until crisp, Ali Slagle writes in this week’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/dining/gnocchis-crispy-lets-eat.html" title="">Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter</a>.
