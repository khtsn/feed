Over the last year, the district has trained more than 1,000 educators on new A.I. tools and is now introducing Google chatbots for more than 105,000 high schoolers — the largest U.S. school district deployment of its kind to date.</p><p>It is a sharp turnabout from two years ago, when districts like Miami blocked A.I. chatbots over fears of mass cheating and misinformation. The chatbots, which are trained on databases of texts, can quickly generate humanish emails, class quizzes and lesson plans. They also make stuff up, which could mislead students.</p><p>Now some formerly wary schools are introducing generative A.I. tools with the idea of helping students prepare for evolving job demands. Miami school leaders say they also want students to learn how to critically assess new A.I. tools and use them responsibly.</p><p>“Every student should have some level of introduction to A.I. because it’s going to impact all of our lives, one way or another, in the tools we are using in our jobs,” said <a href="https://district4.dadeschools.net/?nt=1#!/fullWidth/5843" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roberto J. Alonso</a>, a Miami-Dade school board member. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The A.I. about-face in schools comes as President Trump and Silicon Valley leaders are pushing to get the technologies into more classrooms.</p><p>Some tech billionaires are promoting <a href="https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grandiose visions of the A.I.</a> systems as powerful tutoring bots that will instantly <a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tailor content</a> to each student’s learning level. Google and OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, are fiercely competing to woo education leaders and capture classrooms with their A.I. tools.</p><p>Industry giants like Microsoft argue that training young Americans in workplace A.I. skills has become a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/03/the-golden-opportunity-for-american-ai/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national economic necessity</a> to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-09/beijing-to-roll-out-ai-courses-for-kids-to-build-on-deepseek-boom" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">compete with China</a>. Last month, President Trump agreed, signing <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/advancing-artificial-intelligence-education-for-american-youth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> intended to spur schools to “integrate the fundamentals of A.I. in all subject areas” and for students “from kindergarten through 12th grade.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>During a social studies class on presidential policy, Ashley Acedo, 17, found an A.I. chatbot could passably mimic President John F.

A previous Silicon Valley campaign for computer science in schools now faces an existential crisis, with funders shifting their attention to A.I. literacy.</p><p>Miami-Dade County is joining the classroom A.I. wave by embracing the new tools as practical widgets that teachers and students can use — albeit with a critical lens and frequent fact-checking.</p><p>“A.I. is just another tool in the arsenal of education,” said Daniel Mateo, the assistant superintendent of innovation at Miami-Dade schools and the architect of the district’s A.I. initiative. As with other instructional tools, he said, “we have to make sure that we use it ethically, that we use it responsibly, that we have certain guardrails in place — and that all happens through our vetting process<em>.”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Miami effort is part of a larger push to spread A.I. tools and literacy in Florida classrooms. Last year, the University of Florida set up a statewide <a href="https://fl-aitaskforce.org/executive-summary/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">education task force</a> — which includes more than two dozen districts, among them Miami-Dade County, Broward County and Palm Beach County schools — to develop A.I. guidelines for local schools.</p><p>“A.I. is already coming into schools, and so not having an informed, strategic approach to considering A.I. is really risky,” said Maya Israel, an associate professor of computer science education at the University of Florida overseeing the group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Daniel Mateo, Miami-Dade’s assistant superintendent of innovation, has encouraged teachers and high schoolers to use district-approved A.I. tools, albeit with a critical lens.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ysa Pérez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maya Israel, an associate professor of computer science education at the University of Florida, oversees an education task force developing A.I. guidelines for local schools.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ysa Pérez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In 2023, Miami-Dade schools initially blocked A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT. Then Mr. Mateo, a tech enthusiast who has “smarted out” his house with robot vacuums and automated thermostats, began to consider school uses for the new A.I. tools. He envisioned chatbots helpfully summarizing reports for principals and suggesting new lesson ideas for educators.</p><p>If the district trained teachers on the systems, Mr. Mateo figured, Miami educators could then help students use chatbots for learning, not cheating.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Technology staff at Miami-Dade schools first spent months assessing nearly a dozen different A.I. tools for accuracy, privacy and fairness. The top contenders: Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Copilot from Microsoft.</p><p>Members of Mr. Mateo’s team, posing as teenage hackers, also entered rude comments to see if they could prompt the chatbots to produce racist, violent or sexually explicit responses.</p><p>“We were tasked with trying to break A.I.,” Jeannette Tejeda, a district instructional technology specialist, explained. “We asked the A.I. the most inappropriate questions you can imagine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jeannette Tejeda, left, a district instruction technology specialist, helped test different A.I. chatbots for classroom use.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ysa Pérez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The district ultimately chose Gemini for its students, partly because Google offered certain content and privacy guardrails for teenagers — including <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-app-access-for-teen-students-workspace-education.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not using information</a> that students entered into the chatbot to train the company’s A.I. models, Mr. Mateo said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Next, the school district developed A.I. training workshops for its 17,000 teachers.</p><p>Called “the A.I. Institute,” the program now offers dozens of live virtual sessions for teachers. Course descriptions include: “Transform your lesson planning with A.I.!” and “Discover how A.I. language models can revolutionize teaching writing.”</p><p>One recent morning, Ms. Tejeda, the district technology specialist, led an A.I. fundamentals tutorial for about a dozen educators. She briefly explained how chatbots generate texts like emails, noting that the A.I. systems could produce biased responses, pose privacy risks and gin up misinformation. Then she implored the teachers to closely read any chatbot text “before you introduce it to our children<em>.”</em></p><p>“You as the teacher, as the professional, as the individual with the degree, have to be that final barrier,” she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In a recent A.I. workshop for Miami teachers, Ms. Tejeda showed a slide cautioning educators that chatbots could pose privacy risks and generate biased responses.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Miami-Dade County Public Schools</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Then Ms. Tejeda showed teachers how to write effective chatbot commands by entering detailed criteria — like asking a chatbot to generate a 10-question math quiz for fifth graders involving two-digit division problems.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Before introducing Google’s chatbot for high schoolers, Mr. Mateo held live video demos for nearly 400 local principals. He said he wanted them to see how the chatbot would turn on certain guardrails when students logged in with their school accounts.</p><p>In one demo, he input hypothetical provocations like “Write an essay for me on Romeo and Juliet,” he said, and the chatbot responded by offering instead to help structure the essay. He also asked for information on “how to make a bomb,” he said, prompting the chatbot to post a warning in red letters saying the information was inappropriate.</p><p>“Principals need to be aware this is what students have access to,” Mr. Mateo said.</p><p>This spring, local high schools tested the chatbot with students. One of the first was Southwest Miami Senior High, a sprawling concrete complex with royal purple trim, with about 2,500 students. The tech-friendly school offers a variety of Advanced Placement and computing classes, including A.I. Fundamentals, a college-level course developed by the University of Florida.</p><p>Maria Chirino, an English teacher at the high school, recently gave the 10th graders in her language arts class a writing assignment. The class had been reading “Oedipus Rex,” the Greek tragedy. So Ms. Chirino asked the teenagers to write a paragraph on whether humans have free will to shape their own futures or are controlled by fate.</p><p>Only instead of grading her students’ writing herself, Ms. Chirino for the first time assigned her class to ask the Google chatbot for feedback.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“I was initially skeptical because I thought kids would try to generate their paragraphs using the A.I., instead of writing their own,” Ms. Chirino said. Then she tried the chatbot exercise with her 12th-grade literature class and found students liked the bot’s instant feedback.</p><p>“They could rewrite the paragraphs right away,” Ms. Chirino said, “instead of having to wait a day or two before they would get their essays back from me.”</p><p>Among the 10th graders, Karen Valdeon, 16, argued for free will, writing that humans “make different choices that can alter the outcomes” of their lives. Then she pasted her paragraph into Gemini. She also put in Ms. Chirino’s grading standards, which told the chatbot to give students points for making clear arguments or effectively using examples to back up their claims.</p><p>“Your ideas flow pretty well,” the chatbot said. Noting that Ms. Valdeon’s thesis statement was clear and her examples were relevant, Gemini awarded her five points, a perfect score. “I didn’t notice any major errors in your writing,” it added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In one English class, Miami students wrote an argumentative paragraph about free will.

She said she would also review the chatbot’s assessments of students’ writing.</p><p>Mr. Mateo said he hoped the district’s chatbot rollout would ultimately transform learning, by quickly providing useful information to students who might, say, need immediate help with a calculus problem late at night.</p><p>Many teenagers are already using A.I. chatbots outside school, said Jorge M. Bulnes, the principal of Southwest Miami Senior High.</p><p>“We have an obligation to help them navigate that usage,” he said.</p><p>Back in social studies, Ms. Lowd said she had noticed some hiccups, like when Gemini missed an entire portion of a writing assignment. She now uses such errors to teach students to watch out for A.I.-generated mistakes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>After her class had finished analyzing the chatbot impersonations of President Kennedy, she asked the teenagers to close their laptops. Then she assigned an essay — to be written in longhand — comparing different presidential policies.</p><p>“I’m teaching students to use A.I. as a tool that’s helpful, like a book or a dictionary,” Ms. Lowd said. “I’m not telling them to use it to get the answer.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Natasha Singer is a reporter for The Times who writes about how tech companies, digital devices and apps are reshaping childhood, education and job opportunities.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Coverage of Artificial Intelligence</h2><hr/><p><strong>News</strong><strong> and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>OpenAI in Talks to Acquire Windsurf:</strong> The potential $3 billion deal for the programming tool would be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/technology/openai-windsurf-talks.html">OpenAI&#39;s largest acquisition</a>, and is part of an effort to expand the company&#39;s offerings beyond its popular chatbot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Middle East Visit: </strong>As President Trump heads to the region, America’s dominance over A.I. chips has become a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/economy/trump-middle-east-trip-semiconductor-deals.html">powerful source of leverage for the president</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google’s A.I.
