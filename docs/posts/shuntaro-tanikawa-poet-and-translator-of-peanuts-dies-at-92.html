He was 92.</p><p>The death, at a hospital, was confirmed by his daughter, Shino Tanikawa, who did not specify a cause.</p><p>A perennial front-runner for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Mr. Tanikawa was a revered figure in Japan, not just in literary circles but also among casual readers. It was not uncommon to see commuters reading his books on the subway.</p><p>He published more than 60 collections of poetry, beginning in 1952, when he was 21, with “Alone in Two Billion Light Years” — a book that heralded a bold new voice who shunned haiku and other traditional Japanese forms of verse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the title poem from that collection (translated by Takako U. Lento), he wrote:</p><p><em>On this small sphere</em></p><p><em>I don’t know what Martians do</em></p><p><em>Universal gravitation is</em></p><p><em>The universe is warped</em></p><p><em>The universe is growing fast</em></p><p><em>Standing alone in two billion light years</em></p><p>Being alone and sneezing at the universe’s bewitching tendencies were sentiments that echoed throughout Mr. Tanikawa’s writing. In poems like “Before We Were Born,” “At Midnight in the Kitchen I Wanted to Talk to You” and “A Morning Takes Shape,” he sketched the quotidian, beguiling and lonesome moments of daily life.</p><p>In “Can You Hear,” he wrote:</p><p><em>Can you hear the quiet</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“My poetry is the expression of a moment rather than of history,” he said in a 1998 interview with the Australian literary journal Southerly. “I often say this: The novel captures events within a certain time frame, but poetry, I believe, cuts through life to reveal a cross section of experience.”</p><p>That point of view made him a vital voice in Japanese letters after World War II, when hundreds of literary journals emerged amid the nation’s economic and cultural recovery. Many writers, especially poets, continued to work in traditional Japanese forms, but not Mr. Tanikawa.</p><p>“I think that is the core of his popularity,” Ms. Lento, who translated Mr. Tanikawa’s <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781933947570/the-art-of-being-alone/#bookTabs=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Art of Being Alone: Poems 1952–2009”</a> (and who died recently), said in an interview. “Anyone from a young child who has no life experience to a senior literary critic can see something substantial in his work.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Nyahh!

Schulz’s</a> “Peanuts” into Japanese.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Peanuts” collections were best sellers in Japan, and eventually Snoopy-branded stores, hotels and cafes popped up throughout the country. In 2016, the Charles M. Schulz Museum opened a satellite outpost in Japan called the Snoopy Museum Tokyo.</p><p>Cultural critics, <a href="https://underunderstood.com/podcast/episode/snoopy-in-japan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcasters</a> and even academic publications like the Journal of General Management have, over the years, sought to unravel the popularity of “Peanuts” in Japan.</p><p>One reason they point to: Mr. Schulz’s simple drawing style, which mirrors the sleek, stark aesthetic of Japanese design and pop culture.</p><p>Another (possibly bigger) reason: Mr. Tanikawa’s extraordinary ability to mimic the voices of “Peanuts” characters, whose philosophical sensibilities — encapsulated in Snoopy’s line “You play with the cards you’re dealt … whatever that means” — resonated with Japanese society.</p><p>Mr. Tanikawa and Mr. Schulz’s widow, <a href="https://schulzmuseum.org/jeanschulz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jean Schulz</a>, discussed the poet-cartoonist mind meld during a 2016 conversation published in one of the Schulz Museum’s exhibition catalogs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“I had the impression that he was like a philosopher,” Mr. Tanikawa said, according to a translation of the conversation provided by the museum. He added, “I think Snoopy is a dog sometimes becoming really close to how humans feel.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Tanikawa had a gift for mimicking the voices of Snoopy and the other “Peanuts” characters, whose philosophical sensibilities resonated with Japanese society.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">© Charles M.

His father was a philosopher and a university professor.</p><p>Shuntaro did not excel in high school, which he hated. He did not attend college. He did not dream of becoming a poet.</p><p>“I didn’t start writing poetry because I liked poetry or read a great deal of it or because I wanted to become a poet,” he told Southerly. “My relationship with poetry is best described as more of an arranged marriage than a love match. Without knowing exactly what poetry was, I simply wrote about how I felt in the same way as young people write in a diary.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>One day, he recalled, his father asked him, “If you’re not going to university, what are you going to do?”</p><p>He showed his father some poems.</p><p>The elder Mr. Tanikawa liked them and, using his university connections, sent them to the Japanese poet <a href="https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poets/poet/102-16354_Miyoshi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tatsuji Miyoshi</a>, who thought the writing showed promise. Mr. Miyoshi helped him get several poems published in a literary magazine.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shuntaro Tanikawa in 2016, with Jean Schulz, the wife of the “Peanuts” creator Charles Schulz, at the Snoopy Museum Tokyo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">© Charles M.

In addition to translating “Peanuts” and the Mother Goose rhymes, he wrote the lyrics for the theme song to the popular TV cartoon series “Astro Boy.”</p><p>His marriages to Eriko Kishida, Tomoko Okubo and Yoko Sano ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his son, the composer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0849460/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kensaku Tanikawa</a>; a stepson, Gen Hirose; four grandchildren; and a great-grandson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Tanikawa was frequently asked by younger poets how they should go about writing poetry. His advice was typically pithy.</p><p>“I tell them to find a poem they like,” he said. “I’ve got to the stage where I can get away with this sort of thing but, in the final analysis, it ends up with me saying that people who write poetry were born to write poetry.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
