dead fish from the waters around the port of Volos, a scenic summer destination, after a mass die-off of fish that is believed to be linked to climate change.</p><p>As televised images on Thursday showed fishing boats trawling through a silvery blanket of dead fish that formed off the port earlier this week, passers-by snapped photographs of the gruesome scene on their cellphones.</p><p>Greek officials traded accusations over the disaster as seafront businesses dependent on tourism said they have seen their revenues slashed by 80 percent since the freshwater fish showed up earlier this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And then there was the horrific smell that wafted through the port and its surrounding area.</p><p>Scientists said the deaths most

This summer’s extreme heat has stoked more frequent wildfires, heat-related deaths and flooding — along with the growing threat of drought.</p><p>The fish are believed to have been forced downstream to Volos from the area of Lake Karla, a European Union-protected wetland, which saw its water levels rise sharply after a major storm that caused widespread flooding in central Greece last fall. </p><p>The storm had flooded some 50,000 acres of land around Lake Karla, said Pantelis Sidiropoulos, an assistant professor of rural and surveying engineering at Aristotle University in Thessaloniki.</p><p>But extreme temperatures caused much of that water to evaporate, leaving masses of fish in dwindling waters with inadequate oxygen and poisoned by toxins, Mr. Sidiropoulos said in a telephone interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The fish are basically victims of climate change,” he said, noting that his colleagues had seen dead fish in the farmland next to Lake Karla earlier this week.</p><p>“The authorities had months to remove the fish from the area,” he added. “They’ve been sitting in stagnant waters for a long time.”</p><p>Local authorities did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dead fish on a beach in Volos.
