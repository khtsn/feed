Rupert Murdoch, a man who has made and broken leaders across the globe — but a mild-mannered county probate commissioner, Edmund J. Gorman Jr., who does much of his work without fanfare in his high-desert city.</p><p>It was Mr. Gorman who several weeks ago agreed to hear evidence in a fight between Mr. Murdoch, 93, and three of his adult children that is not about financial benefits but about control over his media companies after he dies. His businesses include Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The Sun of London and a large collection of newspapers in Australia.</p><p>And next week, barring an unexpected last-minute settlement, it is Mr. Gorman who, after five days of testimony from Mr. Murdoch and his four eldest children in his hearing room, will recommend whether Mr. Murdoch should be granted his wish: to guarantee that his elder son, Lachlan, gains full control over the media dynasty after he dies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That can happen only if Mr. Gorman allows Mr. Murdoch to change the terms of the “irrevocable” family trust he agreed to some two decades ago. Set in stone after his divorce from his second wife, Anna Murdoch Mann, the trust gives Lachlan and his three oldest siblings equal say over the controlling shares of the family’s companies upon Mr. Murdoch’s death.</p><p>The final decision in the case will have wide-ranging effects in media and politics, determining whether Fox News and the Murdochs’ other populist conservative clarions stay on their hard-right course, as Lachlan Murdoch prefers, or move toward the more centrist sensibilities of the three siblings, James, Elisabeth and Prudence, who Mr. Murdoch fears will outvote Lachlan upon his passing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-3"><div><figcaption><span>Mr. Murdoch is being challenged by, from left, his children Elisabeth (with her husband, Keith Tyson), Prudence and James (with his wife, Kathryn Murdoch).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Vickie Flores/EPA, via Shutterstock; PA Images/Alamy Stock Photo; Julia Nikhinson/Reuters</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The case could bring the denouement in a decades-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html" title="">family drama</a> over whom Mr. Murdoch would choose as his true successor. It has pitted sibling against sibling and finally created a lasting rift between Mr. Murdoch and his second son, James, who has emerged as an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/media/james-murdoch-resigns-news-corp.html" title="">open critic</a> of the empire’s right-wing populism and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/james-murdoch-slams-fox-news-and-news-corp-over-climate-change-denial" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate denialism</a>.</p><p>The saga reached its apotheosis late last year when Mr. Murdoch surprised James, Elisabeth and Prudence by secretly moving to change the trust in Nevada to favor Lachlan — drawing harsh recriminations from the disenfranchised children, who moved to challenge the proposed changes in Nevada probate court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>All of that had been taking place in secret until July, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/business/media/rupert-murdoch-succession-fox.html" title="">The New York Times</a> obtained documents detailing the looming court fight.</p><p>The case has brought perhaps the most national attention to the Washoe County probate courthouse since it graced the cover of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1UQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Life magazine</a> in 1937, for its reputation as the epicenter of a relatively new trend: divorce. (The cover image featured a newly divorced woman kissing one of the courthouse columns; the piece called Reno “Mecca of the disillusioned June bride.”)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The evidentiary hearing is scheduled to start Monday at the Washoe County Courthouse in Reno, Nev.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rex Wholster/Alamy Stock Photo</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Starting Monday, the father and the children are scheduled to appear before Mr. Gorman to provide testimony that promises to be as gripping and Shakespearean as anything in the hit HBO show “Succession,” which was, after all, based loosely on the Murdoch family.</p><p>Mr. Gorman has almost entirely shut down legal efforts — including by The Times — to open the case, and that testimony, to the public. Nevada probate law is popular with dynastic titans like Mr. Murdoch for its privacy protections and tax provisions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Technically, Mr. Gorman is not a judge. As the probate commissioner in Washoe County, he is effectively a “special master” assigned to weigh evidence in disputes, including in trial-like hearings such as those he will hold with the Murdochs, and then write his legal opinion at the end, as a judge would.</p><p>His opinion is formally a recommendation that requires sign-off from one of the judicial district’s three probate judges. The judge will have to weigh in more directly if either party challenges Mr. Gorman’s recommendation — which must be done within 14 days of his decision. The judge could at that point open the case to still more litigation.</p><p>Even after that, the losing side has the right to try to appeal up through the Nevada court system.</p><p>“Something like this could go on for years,” said Molly LeGoy, a probate lawyer in Reno. That is, she said, a common risk of such family trust battles, which, geopolitical implications or no, often surface sibling rivalry, betrayal and ancient emotional grievance.</p><p>“When legal issues include family dynamics, there’s always the opportunity for more hurt, more venom — and more legal action,” Ms. LeGoy said.</p><p>Mr. Gorman, 43, is a graduate of Stanford Law and served as a local probate lawyer before the chief judge of Nevada’s Second Judicial District Court appointed him to his current job in 2019. According to his official biography, he is an avid skier and waterfowl hunter. (He declined interview requests.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>As he rarely warrants mention in the local press, Mr. Gorman’s main public profile comes by way of his membership on the boards of the Reno Jazz Orchestra and the Reno Host Lions Club Charity Foundation.</p><p>While in private practice, he was so well known for his advocacy of pro bono work that he was named Pro Bono Attorney of the Year in 2015 by Nevada Legal Services. The next year, in an article for Nevada Lawyer magazine, he called on his fellow lawyers to channel their inner Atticus Finch — “the thoughtful, ethical small-town lawyer” in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” he wrote — by doing pro bono work.</p><p>In Mr. Gorman, the Murdochs will be facing a judicial temperament that local lawyers describe as fair, by the book and serious about the rules.</p><p>“He takes his job very seriously, and he’s somewhat of a legal scholar himself and takes great pride in accurate opinions,” said J. Douglas Clark, the founding president of the Probate Bar Association of Washoe County, who has frequently appeared before Mr. Gorman. “He has measured levity but conducts everything with proper decorum.”</p><p>Among the rules that Mr. Gorman takes seriously are those involving confidentiality. For a time, the Murdoch case was even hidden entirely on the court’s official website, an extraordinary level of secrecy, Mr. Clark said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Some news organizations, including The Times and the local site <a href="https://www.ournevadajudges.com/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Our Nevada Judges</a>, sued to open the Murdoch hearing room to the press. In resisting, Mr. Gorman <a href="https://thisisreno.com/2024/08/probate-commissioner-bars-media-covering-murdoch-family-trust-battle/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>: “The parties in this case brought their case in this jurisdiction and invoked their rights under the Nevada Revised Statutes under the expectation that this ‘confidential information’ would remain confidential.” (On Thursday night, he reaffirmed his refusal to open his hearing room and almost all of the case record.) </p><p>The only visibility into how Mr. Gorman is handling the Murdoch case came in the sealed legal documents obtained by The Times, which contained a pretrial recommendation on the two sides’ arguments.</p><p>Appearing to play it right down the middle, Mr. Gorman determined that Mr. Murdoch was within his rights to change the trust, under an amendment clause that allows him to make alterations as long they are solely for the benefit of all his heirs. But Mr. Gorman said it was not clear that Mr. Murdoch was making a good-faith argument in saying he was pursuing a change to benefit all the heirs.</p><p>Mr. Murdoch has argued that Lachlan’s siblings could change the editorial direction at outlets like Fox News to be less conservative, or bring constant leadership fights, all of which would harm the value of the family’s holdings, he maintains.</p><p>The coming evidentiary hearing is meant to determine Mr. Murdoch’s motive, which will determine Mr. Gorman’s opinion on the proposed changes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>While many family trust cases drag on for years, Ms. LeGoy noted that many were ultimately settled. As The Times first reported in 2019, Lachlan and his siblings came close the previous year to a deal in which he would buy them out of the trust, but it did not go forward.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/rupert-murdoch-family-rift-trust-385f73d2?st=XFKSKt&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported this week that James Murdoch had raised a similar potential deal ahead of next week’s scheduled court appearance, but with no agreement in sight the dispute is headed to Mr. Gorman’s hearing room instead.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Rutenberg is a writer at large for The Times and The New York Times Magazine and writes most often about media and politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-rutenberg">More about Jim Rutenberg</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Media Industry</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Spectator Magazine:</strong> Paul Marshall, a multimillionaire founder and investor in upstart conservative media outlets, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/world/europe/spectator-paul-marshall-telegraph.html">bought the right-wing British magazine</a> in a deal worth about $131 million.</p></li><li><p><strong>Univision:</strong> Jorge Ramos, who is among the most recognized journalists in Spanish-language television, will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/jorge-ramos-univision-departure.html">leave Univision after 40 years at the network</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Insider:</strong> Business Insider named Jamie Heller, the business editor of The Wall Street Journal, to lead its newsroom as its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/media/business-insider-jamie-heller.html">next editor in chief</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disney:</strong> The inside story of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/business/media/disney-bob-iger-chapek.html">how Bob Iger undermined and outmaneuvered Bob Chapek</a>, his chosen successor, and returned to power at Disney.</p></li><li><p><strong>Paramount:</strong> An F.C.C. filing shows that companies affiliated with Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/business/media/paramount-skydance-larry-ellison.html">will own most of the voting interest</a> currently held by Shari Redstone, replacing her as the company’s most influential shareholder.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
