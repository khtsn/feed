data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A former Israeli defense minister has accused Israel of committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip, a rare critique from a member of the security establishment at a time of war.</p><p>The comments by Moshe Yaalon came amid mounting criticism of the Israeli military’s conduct in Gaza. They were swiftly denied and condemned by allies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, saying that they would hurt the country and help its enemies.</p><p>Mr. Yaalon served as the Israeli military’s chief of staff during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/28/world/year-of-intifada-sees-hardening-on-each-side.html" title="">second intifada</a> and as Mr. Netanyahu’s defense minister during the 2014 war in Gaza, the longest conflict between Israel and Hamas before the current war. But he broke with Mr. Netanyahu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/world/middleeast/moshe-yaalon-israeli-defense-minister-resigns.html" title="">in 2016</a> and has since become a critic of the Israeli leader.</p><p>At an event on Saturday, Mr. Yaalon denounced Mr. Netanyahu’s government for its actions in Gaza.</p><p>“The path they’re dragging us down is to occupy, annex, and ethnically cleanse — look at the northern strip,” he said. He also said Israel was being pulled in the direction of building settlements in the territory, a notion that is supported by far-right politicians in Mr. Netanyahu’s government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>When the interviewer at the event asked Mr. Yaalon to clarify whether he thought Israel was on the way to carrying out ethnic cleansing, he responded: “Why on the way? What’s happening there? What’s happening there?”</p><p>“There’s no <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-beit-lahia.html" title="">Beit Lahia</a>. There’s no Beit Hanoun. They’re now operating in Jabaliya. They’re basically cleaning the territory of Arabs,” he said, referring to towns and cities in northern Gaza where a renewed Israeli offensive against the militant group Hamas has caused extensive damage in recent months. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-death-toll.html" title="">Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed in Gaza</a> since the war began in response to the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023.</p><p>Mr. Yaalon doubled down on his accusations on Sunday, saying on public radio that Mr. Netanyahu’s government was exposing Israeli commanders to lawsuits at the International Criminal Court and was putting their lives at risk.</p><p>“I’m speaking in the name of IDF commanders who are operating in the northern strip,” Mr. Yaalon <a href="https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/830771/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the Reshet Bet radio station</a>. “They reached out to me expressing fear about what’s happening there.”</p><p>He later said, in an apparent reference to the government: “At the end of the day, they’re perpetrating war crimes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Yaalon’s accusations, which came ten days after the International Criminal Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/icc-arrest-warrants-israel-hamas.html" title="">issued arrest warrants</a> for Mr. Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, his former defense minister, for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office has rejected the assertions against the men, calling them “absurd and false” and accusing the court of being motivated by antisemitism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Yaalon’s comments were condemned by Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party, of which Mr. Yaalon is a former member.</p><p>“Yaalon already lost his way a long time ago,” said the party. “His defamatory words are a prize for the International Criminal Court and the haters of Israel camp. Israel is fighting back against a murderous terrorist group that carried out mass slaughter.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Gallant said on Sunday that Mr. Yaalon’s statements were “a lie that aids our enemy and harms Israel.”</p><p>The Israeli military “acted according to the highest standards that can be applied in the complex and difficult war that was imposed on us,” Mr. Gallant said in a <a href="https://x.com/yoavgallant/status/1863148642304991502" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on</a> social media. “The instructions and commands were always given in accordance with the law.”</p><p>Israel has called on Palestinians from the northernmost reaches of Gaza to evacuate on several occasions since the war began last fall, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/world/middleeast/gaza-strip-evacuation-israel-hamas-war.html" title="">in the first week of the conflict</a> and again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-north-evacuations.html" title="">in October.</a> Tens of thousands of people have heeded those warnings and fled, but many are believed to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/gaza-jabaliya-evacuations.html" title="">remained in the area</a>, either because they cannot or do not want to leave.</p><p>In recent months, aid organizations and world leaders, including President Biden, have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in northern Gaza. During that time, Israel has allowed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-us-israel.html" title="">little humanitarian aid to enter</a>. Last month, Israel banned imports of commercial goods, saying that Hamas was benefiting from their sale.</p><p>Israeli officials have said that Palestinians from North Gaza will be able to return to their homes after the war. Mr. Netanyahu has dismissed the idea of building settlements in Gaza, but hard-line members of his right-wing coalition have advocated for it.</p><p>Some Israelis worry that Mr. Netanyahu’s indecision about plans for post-war Gaza could result in a long-term occupation of the enclave, leaving open the possibility for right-wing members of the coalition to advance their ambitions to build settlements.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/international-criminal-court">International Criminal Court</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/likud-party-israel">Likud Party (Israel)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
